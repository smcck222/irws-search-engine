The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Jet
Route J&hyph;512 from the Kalispell, MT, VOR/DME to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, excluding that airspace within Canada.
This action would enhance traffic flow between the United States and Canada. This action would also amend V&hyph;351
from Kalispell, MT, to the United States/Canadian Border to reduce controller workload. Jet routes and domestic
VOR Federal airways are published in paragraphs 2004 and 6010(a), respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17,
1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993.
The jet route and domestic VOR Federal airway listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142). The document proposed to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Justice (``Department'') is issuing for an additional 30-day comment period a proposed rule governing
the circumstances under which its attorneys may communicate with persons and organizations known to be represented
by counsel in the course of law enforcement investigations and proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule is to impose a comprehensive, clear and uniform set of regulations on the conduct of
government attorneys during criminal and civil investigations and enforcement proceedings. The rule is intended
to ensure that government attorneys adhere to the highest ethical standards, while eliminating the uncertainty
and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations of state rules, some of which have been incorporated by
reference as local court rules in a number of federal district courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule establishes a general prohibition, subject to limited enumerated exceptions, against contacts
with ``represented parties.'' This prohibition derives from the American Bar Association (``ABA'') Code of Professional
Responsibility and its successor, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The proposed rule generally permits
investigative contacts with represented individuals or organizations who have not yet been named as defendants
in a civil or criminal enforcement proceeding or arrested as part of a criminal proceeding. However, the rule would
not permit contacts with represented persons without the consent of counsel for the purpose of negotiating plea agreements,
settlements or other similar legal arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department intends to issue substantial additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual (``Manual'')
to provide additional direction to Department attorneys when they deal with represented individuals and organizations,
in order to accommodate more fully the principles and purposes underlying the bar rules. Those provisions further
restrict government attorneys when they contact targets of criminal or civil law enforcement investigations who
are known to be represented by counsel, and when they communicate with other represented persons. The intended additions
to the United States Attorneys' Manual are provided for reference as part of this commentary.

I. General Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department issued for notice and comment a proposed rule on the same subject on two previous occasions. See 57 FR
54737 (Nov. 20, 1992) and 58 FR 39976 (July 26, 1993). The Department received many thoughtful comments from members
of the bar, state courts, bar counsel, federal and state prosecutors and others during those comment periods. The
current version of the proposed rule includes substantial revisions based on those comments. Accordingly, the Department
is issuing the rule again for comments to ensure that all the interested parties have an opportunity to comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal reflects the Department's commitment to fostering ethical behavior consistent with the principles
informing DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility and Rule 4.2 of the Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, while setting forth clear and uniform national guidelines upon which federal attorneys can rely in carrying
out their responsibilities to enforce federal laws. The regulations make clear that federal attorneys generally
continue to be subject to state bar ethical rules where they are licensed to practice, except in the limited circumstances
where state ethical rules clearly conflict with lawful federal procedures and practices. With respect to willful
violations of the contacts rules as embodied in the Attorney General's proposed regulations, federal attorneys
would remain subject to state bar disciplinary sanctions. This new proposal is the product of extensive review, comments
and vigorous debate among judges, federal government attorneys, members of the private bar, disciplinary officials,
academics and ethicists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In essence, the proposed regulations would permit federal prosecutors and agents to continue to conduct criminal
and civil investigations in routine fashion against all individuals, whether or not those persons are represented
by counsel. They would allow Department attorneys to continue to make or direct undercover or overt contacts with
individuals and organizations represented by counsel for the purpose of developing factual information up until
the point at which they are arrested or charged with a crime or named as defendants in a civil law enforcement action.
However, the regulations generally would not permit federal prosecutors to attempt to negotiate plea agreements,
settlements or similar arrangements with individuals represented by counsel outside of the presence or without
the consent of their attorneys. These regulations also would preclude, with certain very narrow exceptions, any
contacts with represented parties after an arrest, indictment, or the filing of a complaint on the subject matter
of the representation. The principal exception to these general prohibitions occurs when the defendant voluntarily
and knowingly initiates a contact with the government attorney, in which case the regulations would require the government
attorney to take the matter before a district judge or magistrate judge to obtain approval for the communication or
to obtain the appointment of substitute counsel for the defendant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Attorneys' Manual will set forth further guidance. The proposed Manual provisions, which are set
out in their entirety at the end of this commentary, prohibit overt approaches by federal attorneys to represented
targets of criminal or civil enforcement proceedings without the consent of counsel, unless certain enumerated
exceptions are met. The Manual also will require that government attorneys receive approval from their supervisors
before communicating with any represented party or represented target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since early in this century, the rules of professional conduct that govern attorneys have required that lawyers for
one party in a dispute communicate only through an adverse party's lawyer, rather than directly. DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)
of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides:

A. During the course of his representation of a client a lawyer shall not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Communicate or cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a party he knows to be represented
by a lawyer in that matter unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized
by law to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.2 of the ABA Model Rules states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer
knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized
by law to do so.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Disciplinary authorities in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia have adopted one of these rules, or a similar
prohibition. Underlying these rules is the recognition that when two parties in a legal proceeding are represented,
it is unfair for an attorney to circumvent opposing counsel and employ superior skills and legal training to take advantage
of the opposing party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the courts have long recognized that government law enforcement agents must be allowed broad powers,
within constitutional limits, to investigate crime and civil violations of police and regulatory laws. These powers
properly include the authority to conduct undercover operations and to interview witnesses, potential suspects,
targets and even defendants who waive their rights to remain silent. Although the Fifth and Sixth Amendments significantly
restrict contacts with defendants after their initial appearance before a judge or after indictment, these constraints
generally do not apply before a person has been taken into custody or charged in an adversary proceeding. Sound policies
support this substantial power of police to investigate. The general public, victims of crime, and even potential
suspects have a strong interest in vigorous inquiry by law enforcement officers before arrest or the filing of charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as investigations were treated as within the province of the police alone, the traditional rule forbidding
counsel from directly contacting represented persons did not come into conflict with legitimate law enforcement
activities. In recent years, however, the Department of Justice has encouraged federal prosecutors to play a larger
role in preindictment, prearrest investigations. Some of this increased involvement stems from the wider use of
law enforcement techniques, such as electronic surveillance, which require the preparation of legal filings. Also,
complex white collar and organized crime investigations necessitate more intensive engagement of lawyers, who
present such cases to grand juries. Most important, greater participation of lawyers at the preindictment stage
of law enforcement has been regarded as helpful in assuring that police investigations comply with high legal and
ethical standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This extension of the traditional prosecutor's responsibility has been a salutary development. One by-product,
however, has been uncertainty about whether the traditional professional limitation on attorney contacts with
represented parties should be viewed as a restriction upon prosecutors engaged in investigations and, by extension,
the agents with whom they work. The overwhelming preponderance of federal appellate courts have held that the restriction
on contacts with represented persons does not apply at the preindictment investigation stage. See, e.g.,

, 858 F.2d 834 (2d Cir. 1988). In recent years, state courts and state bar organizations have expressed different views
on the point at which the prohibition on contacts now embodied in DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2 and their analogs should
apply to criminal enforcement proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty about the scope and applicability of DR 7&hyph;104, Rule 4.2 and their state counterparts has directly
affected the investigative activities of agents, including Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement
Administration personnel, who work with prosecutors. An expansive application of these rules in some jurisdictions
may have the effect of blocking preindictment interviews or undercover operations that most courts have held permissible
under federal constitutional and statutory law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This problem is compounded when federal attorneys assigned to the same case are members of different state bars. Under
federal law, a Department attorney must be a member in good standing of a state bar, but he or she need not belong to the
bar in each state in which he or she is practicing for the government. As a result, prosecution teams often comprise
attorneys admitted to different bars. The application of different state disciplinary rules to these individuals
creates uncertainty, confusion and the possibility of unfairness. Indeed, one member of a two-member federal prosecution
team could receive a commendation for effective law enforcement while the other member would be subject to state discipline
for the exact same conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these circumstances, the Department has concluded that a compelling need exists which warrants a uniform
federal rule to reconcile the traditional rule against contacts with a represented person with the obligation of
the Department of Justice to enforce the law vigorously. Indeed, absent a new federal rule, prosecutors have been
forced on occasion to reduce their participation in the investigative phase of law enforcement so as to leave federal
agents unfettered by state disciplinary rules that were never intended to govern police behavior. Such a retreat
from the field by prosecutors serves neither efficiency nor the interest in elevating legal compliance and ethical
standards in all phases of law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the disciplinary rules themselves invite this type of regulation. Virtually all the states have adopted
rules that include an ``authorized by law'' exception. These proposed regulations are intended to provide legal
authorization in states whose bar rules provide that exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department has long maintained, and continues to maintain, that it has the authority to exempt its attorneys
from the application of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and their state counterparts. Furthermore, the Department
maintains that whether, and to what extent, such prohibitions should apply to Department attorneys is a policy question.
See Ethical Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op.
O.L.C. 576, 577 (1980). However, in light of the fact that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted some
form of a prohibition on contacts with represented parties, and in view of the long history of those rules, the Department
believes that its attorneys should adhere to the principles underlying those rules to the maximum extent possible.
Therefore, even though the Department has the authority to exempt its attorneys from the reach of these rules, the
Department has decided not to implement a wholesale exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rather, the proposed regulations attempt to reconcile the purposes underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 with effective
law enforcement. Recognizing the importance of the attorney-client relationship and the desirability of an individual
who is represented by counsel being fully advised by counsel before negotiating legal agreements, the regulations
provide that federal attorneys may not negotiate plea bargains, settlement agreements, immunity agreements or
similar arrangements without the participation or consent of the individual's attorney. In this context, the prosecutor's
superior legal training and specialized knowledge could be used to the detriment of the untutored layperson. Thus,
the regulations comport with the principal purpose of DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 by insisting that the individual's
attorney participate in these types of negotiations. At the same time, the regulations would permit direct contacts
at the preindictment, prearrest investigative stage with any individual, whether or not he or she is represented
by counsel, to inquire about the matters under investigation. The regulations are drafted to conform to the approach
of most federal appellate courts that have considered the matter. See, e.g.,

, 485 F.2d 941, 955&hyph;56 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 989 (1974). The Department believes that public
policy and effective law enforcement would not be served if one could exempt himself or herself from lawful, court-sanctioned
investigative techniques simply by retaining an attorney. The Department believes that it is inappropriate to alter
investigative techniques based upon an individual's financial ability to retain counsel before the point at which
a court would appoint counsel for a person not able to afford counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations and the accompanying changes to the United States Attorneys' Manual also would give effect to other
important aspects of the bar rules against contacts with represented parties. For example, the regulations would
preclude federal attorneys from disparaging an individual's counsel or from attempting to gain access to attorney-client
confidences or lawful defense strategy. The guidelines contained in the Manual provisions will also make clear that
once an individual is in a likely adversarial situation with the government and has retained an attorney to represent
him or her with respect to the particular subject matter under investigation, the government attorney must take greater
care before making any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts. While the proposed regulations authorize most communications before arrest, the proposed Manual changes
provide that, as a matter of internal policy guidance, federal prosecutors generally should not make overt contacts
with represented targets of investigations. However, the Manual provisions permit overt contacts with a represented
target when initiated by the target; when necessary to prevent death or physical injury; when the relevant investigation
involves ongoing, additional or different crimes from that to which the representation relates; or when a United
States Attorney or an Assistant Attorney General expressly concludes, under all of the circumstances, that the contact
is needed for effective law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed regulations and Manual provisions also address when a government attorney may communicate
with an employee, officer or director of a represented corporation or organization without the consent of counsel.
The regulations generally prohibit a government attorney from communicating with a current, high-level employee
of a represented organization who participates as a ``decision maker in the determination of the organization's
legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject matter'' and the organization has been named as a
defendant in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Manual provisions further generally prohibit contacts
with controlling individuals of organizations that have not yet been named as defendants but are targets of federal
criminal or civil law enforcement investigations without the consent of counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations recognize that state courts and disciplinary bodies continue to play the primary role in
regulating the conduct of all attorneys, including those who work for the federal government. Further, Department
of Justice attorneys continue to be subject to state bar ethical rules except to the limited extent those rules conflict
with lawful federal procedures and practices. As noted above, however, because of the expanded participation of
federal prosecutors in preindictment investigations, DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 have inevitably affected
and circumscribed the power of federal law enforcement officials to carry out their legally mandated responsibilities.
State courts and disciplinary committees are not the appropriate final arbiters of the scope of federal policing.
The Department of Justice must assume this role, subject to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The
new regulations would not supplant state discipline. Rather, the regulations would provide that attorneys who comply
with the new federal rule will be shielded from inconsistent state disciplinary rules. On the other hand, attorneys
who willfully violate the new regulations would continue to be subject to the full measure of state disciplinary jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is confident that, taken together, the proposed regulations, Manual amendments and this supplemental
information will promote the public interest in effective law enforcement conforming to the highest standards of
legal ethics.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments received following the second publication of the earlier proposal were similar in many respects to those
received in the first round of comments. As of September 19, 1993, the Department received 219 written comments. Of
those, 159 comments were received from Department of Justice employees. Of those, 144, mostly from federal prosecutors
from around the country, supported promulgation of the earlier proposal; 1 opposed the rule; and 14 others provided
miscellaneous comments. The Department also received 21 comments from federal officials outside the Department,
18 of whom supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received 39 comments from individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. These
writers included private attorneys, public defenders, state court judges, bar associations, disciplinary officials
and others. Twenty-eight writers in that group expressed opposition to the rule while 3 supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those writing in support of the earlier proposal generally emphasized three major points. First, they stated that
a clear rule governing communications by federal attorneys with represented individuals was critical to the vigorous
enforcement of federal law. Several writers stated that the lack of clarity on the matter created by a variety of court
and bar association opinions has had a chilling effect on federal enforcement efforts. They stated that some federal
prosecutors fearful of the uncertain state of the law and unwilling to risk their licenses to practice law have decided
not to engage in routine discussions with represented individuals. Second, several writers described the practice
of some attorneys to claim representation of all the employees of a corporate client. They argued that this practice,
along with the uncertainty of the state of the disciplinary rules, often makes it exceedingly difficult to investigate
wrongdoing by corporations or other organizations. Third, several supporters of the previous proposal stated that
they did not believe that it was the intention of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 to apply to criminal investigations.
Furthermore, they argued that if the prohibitions in those rules apply to all federal criminal and civil investigations
the result will be twofold: (1) Federal attorneys will be forced to reverse the trend of the last 20 years and become
less involved in investigations; and (2) federal agents will stop consulting with federal attorneys during investigations.
Both of these trends will result in less effective law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received several comments critical of the earlier proposal. Those criticisms fall generally in four
categories. First, several individuals stated that they believed the proposal would exempt Department attorneys
from ethical requirements that apply to all other attorneys, thus creating a double standard. Furthermore, they
argued that the proposal improperly equated constitutional minimums with ethical conduct. Second, several writers
argued that the Attorney General did not have the authority to promulgate such a regulation. They argued that the proposal
unfairly impinged on the traditional right of state supreme courts to monitor and discipline attorneys admitted
to practice before them. They also questioned whether the drafters of the ``authorized by law'' exceptions could
have intended that the Attorney General would be empowered to release Department attorneys from the obligations
of the rules simply by issuing a regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, several people argued that the proposed regulation was not necessary for the vigorous enforcement of the law.
And fourth, several writers commented on various aspects of the proposal itself. The most common objection was to
the ``controlling individual'' test that the proposal used to determine whether communications with a particular
employee of a represented corporation would be permissible. They argued that the test was much too narrow and would
only apply to a corporation's general counsel and a small handful of very senior executives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has reviewed, analyzed and carefully considered all the comments it received and has made substantial
revisions to its earlier proposal based on these comments. The Department believes the current proposal, in combination
with the proposed additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual, appropriately addresses the concerns of the
commenters critical of the earlier proposal, while preserving the Department's ability to enforce federal laws.
Due to the significant nature of the changes made, the Department determined that an additional comment period is
appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 77.1&blank;Purpose and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes no material changes from the rule published earlier. It does, however, include additional
discussion regarding the purpose of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's authority to establish standards of conduct for Department of Justice attorneys derives
from two distinct sources: Section 301 of title 5, United States Code, and title 28 of the United States Code, which,
through a variety of provisions, authorizes the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to enforce federal
law. Section 301 states that ``[t]he head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations
for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, [and] the distribution and performance of its
business.'' Authority to promulgate this rule also is implicit in the Attorney General's statutory power to ``supervise
all litigation'' to which the United States is a party and to direct United States Attorneys and other subordinate
attorneys in the ``discharge of their respective duties.'' 28 U.S.C. 519. Other specific statutory references are
indicated in the text of the rule.

Section 77.2&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is substantially similar to the definitional section of the previous proposal. Two changes, however,
are worthy of attention: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
``Attorney for the Government'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the definition of ``attorney for the government'' has been refined explicitly to exclude from the definition
those law enforcement agents employed by the Department of Justice who are also members of state bars, if they are employed
as, and are performing the function of, agents rather than attorneys. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement
Agency and other investigative agencies have long recruited individuals with advanced degrees_including, for
example, engineering, business and law degrees_to serve as agents. The Department strongly encourages the recruitment
of educated and specially trained individuals for positions as agents. An agent's bar membership should not adversely
affect his or her ability to conduct comprehensive investigations and otherwise to fulfill his or her law enforcement
functions. Therefore, the proposed rule specifically exempts attorney-agents from its scope if they are employed
by the government as investigative agents and not as attorneys.

``Undercover Investigation'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the section now includes a definition of the term ``undercover investigation.'' Under this definition,
the hallmark of an ``undercover operation'' is an investigation in which an individual ``whose identity as an official
of the government or a person acting at the behest thereof is concealed or is intended to be concealed.'' This definition
is intended to be read broadly to include virtually every type of law enforcement investigation in which the identity
of a government employee, or the fact that an individual is cooperating with the government, is concealed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section differs significantly from the corresponding section in the earlier proposal in order more closely
to follow the language in DR 7&hyph;104(a)(1) and Rule 4.2, which establish general prohibitions against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with a represented party, and to differentiate between those individuals who are represented by counsel
and have become a party to a proceeding, and those represented individuals who are not parties to any relevant proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual is considered to be a ``represented party'' under these rules if: (1) The person is represented by counsel;
(2) the representation is current and concerns the subject matter in question; and (3) the person has either been arrested
or charged in a federal criminal case or is a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding concerning the subject
matter of the representation. If the person is currently represented in fact regarding the subject matter in question,
but has not been charged or arrested, that person is considered a ``represented person.'' Thus, witnesses, suspects
and targets of investigations who have not been indicted or arrested are considered represented persons under this
rule and in the United States Attorneys' Manual guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 77.5 of this rule generally prohibits government attorneys from initiating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented persons. (However, &sect;&sect;77.8 and 77.9 prohibit some contacts with represented
persons as well.) This distinction between represented parties and represented persons is consistent with the rulings
of the vast majority of federal courts to consider the issue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is substantially similar to the corresponding section in the earlier proposal. The section has been
revised slightly to make clear that although the proposed rule does not supersede the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this limitation does not extend to other rules regarding procedure in
federal courts. Thus, rules of procedure adopted by individual courts as local rules, many of which incorporate state
bar rules, are not included in this limitation.

Section 77.5&blank;General Rule for Civil and Criminal Enforcement; Represented Parties

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section, as well as sections 77.6 through 77.9, differs substantially from corresponding sections contained
in the earlier proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section closely tracks the language of DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Rule 4.2 and applies similar prohibitions to
attorneys for the government. The section prohibits an attorney for the government from communicating with a represented
party, as defined in &sect;77.3, about the subject matter of the representation without the consent of that individual's
attorney. The prohibition applies, however, only if the attorney for the government knows that the represented party
is, in fact, represented by counsel. Therefore, communications by an attorney for the government with a represented
party will not violate this rule if the attorney for the government is unaware of the fact of representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also prohibits an attorney for the government from causing another individual to communicate with a
represented party. Accordingly, a government investigator acting at the attorney's direction and control may not
do what the attorney himself or herself is prohibited from doing. Conversely, a government attorney will not be personally
responsible for the actions of agents in communicating with represented persons unless, in doing so, the agents were
acting as the attorney's ``alter ego.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It also should be noted that this provision is violated (and thus, a basis for departmental discipline exists) when
an inappropriate communication takes place, regardless of whether or not the communication results in eliciting
an inculpatory statement or is otherwise prejudicial to the represented party.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the circumstances under which Department attorneys may communicate, or cause others to communicate,
with a represented party who the Department attorney knows is represented concerning the subject matter of the representation
without first obtaining the consent of the represented party's counsel. The exceptions enumerated in this section
are similar to, but not identical with, the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.7 of the earlier proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Paragraph (a): Determination if Representation Exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This exception recognizes the fact that there is no reason to prohibit a limited inquiry about whether an individual
is, in fact, represented by counsel regarding the relevant subject matter. Such an inquiry does not involve the kind
of communication about which courts have expressed concern and has little potential for undermining the attorney-client
relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be uncertainty about the existence of representation with respect to whether it has been established, whether
it may have been terminated, and whether a particular subject falls within the scope of the representation. The first
issue may arise when a judicial or other appearance has not occurred, but the government attorney has some information
suggesting that the person may be represented. It may also arise when an attorney purports to represent a group of persons,
such as all the employees of a corporation. Uncertainty about the termination of the representation may arise when
substantial time has passed since it was made known that the person was represented by counsel or when the attorney
for the government has reason to believe that the representation has ceased. It is unlikely, however, that such uncertainty
will arise when there are pending judicial proceedings, since the court must approve termination of representation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When inquiring about the status of representation, government attorneys and agents generally must refrain from
stating whether it is necessary or desirable to be represented by counsel. After the right to counsel has attached,
a statement or implication suggesting that counsel is not providing proper or effective representation could violate
the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. See

This exception is not intended to and does not create a duty on the part of the attorney for the government to inquire
about the status of representation. However, if the attorney for the government has any reason to believe that the
individual is represented by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, he or she should, as a matter of course,
make the appropriate inquiries before engaging in substantive discussions with the individual.

Paragraph (c): Initiation of Communication by Represented Party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the concerns most frequently raised by Department attorneys during the comment period on the previous proposal
was the lack of clarity under current law regarding the propriety of communicating with a represented party, in the
absence of that party's counsel, when the communication is initiated by the party. A defendant may wish to communicate
with the government outside the presence of counsel for many valid reasons. Department attorneys repeatedly cited
the situation in which a defendant wants to cooperate with the government but does not want his or her attorney to know
for fear that the attorney will disclose the defendant's intentions to others. This situation typically arises when
the defendant questions the loyalty of his or her attorney, who is being paid by another individual involved in a criminal
enterprise. The same problem may arise when a single attorney represents multiple parties who are part of the same
criminal enterprise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the desire of a defendant or arrestee to speak with the attorney for the government outside the presence of his
or her counsel is ``voluntary, knowing and informed,'' there is no valid reason to prohibit the government from engaging
in such communications. In fact, the Department believes that it would be a dereliction of its obligation to enforce
vigorously federal law if it promulgated a rule that would prohibit such communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that an individual who is entitled to counsel under the Fifth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment
may waive that right and choose to communicate with the government outside the presence of his or her attorney, ``provided
the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.''

that are allowed by the Constitution by a disciplinary rule that was intended to protect that individual in the first
place. Neither common sense nor the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 require such a result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph amends the previous proposal by adding procedural protections designed to ensure that such waivers
are in fact voluntary, knowing, and informed. After a represented individual has been arrested or charged in a criminal
proceeding or is named as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding, the proposed rule requires that several
steps be taken before any substantive discussions take place. First, the government attorney must inform the individual
of his or her right to speak through his or her attorney and to have that attorney present for any communications with
the government attorney. Second, the represented party must waive his or her right to counsel in such a way as to indicate
that the waiver is voluntary, knowing and informed. If at all possible, the attorney for the government should obtain
a signed written waiver. Third, the attorney for the government must bring the matter before the appropriate district
court judge, magistrate or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. The court should be asked for a determination:
That the waiver satisfies the provisions of this rule; or that substitute counsel is in place and that counsel consents
to the communication; or, in the alternative, that it is appropriate for the court to appoint counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not, however, require that the waiver take place before the judge or magistrate. In exceptional circumstances,
it may be impractical or unsafe to bring the defendant before a judge or magistrate to secure the waiver. In those cases,
the tribunal must determine in advance of substantive discussions, based on the evidence before it, whether the waiver
was made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the initiation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts by represented parties frequently occurs in the context of the ``fearful defendant'' whose attorney has
been chosen by a third party, often an individual above the defendant in the criminal hierarchy. Such a defendant may
wish to cooperate with the government but may fear that his life or safety will be endangered if his attorney learns
of the cooperation. Although the need for a mechanism by which a represented party can initiate contacts with the government
is particularly acute in this context, paragraph (c) is not limited to this setting. Rather, the proper inquiry is
whether the represented party's waiver of the right to counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed_not whether the
represented party has established some overriding justification for his or her decision.

Paragraph (d): Waivers at the Time of Arrest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) of this section provides the general rule regarding how a represented party may waive any protections
otherwise provided under this regulation. This paragraph provides for a more specific rule dealing with a waiver
at the time of arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that a government attorney may communicate directly with a represented party without the
consent of that party's counsel at the time of his or her arrest if the represented party has been fully informed of his
or her Constitutional rights at that time and has waived them. The government attorney need not comply with any of the
additional requirements of paragraph (c) in such a situation. However, it is generally prudent to obtain a written
waiver at the time of arrest if possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception is intended to preserve the ability of government attorneys to interview individuals immediately
following arrest as an effective and important law enforcement tool. A substantial body of law has developed regarding
the post-arrest waiver of various Constitutional rights. The Department believes that the Constitutional requirements
identified in that decisional law adequately protect represented individuals following arrest. Furthermore,
the effectiveness of post-arrest interviews would be significantly curtailed if the procedural requirements of
paragraph (c) applied. Accordingly, this paragraph is intended to preserve this investigative tool without adding
any additional procedural requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with a represented party if the contacts involve the investigation of offenses as to which the represented
party has neither been arrested nor charged in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Department believes
this approach is wholly consistent with DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and the cases interpreting them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this section provides that communications may be made in the course of investigations of additional,
different or ongoing criminal or unlawful activity, even though the individual is represented by counsel with respect
to conduct for which he or she has already been arrested or charged. Such additional criminal or unlawful conduct is
typically one of three varieties: (1) Conduct that is separate from the original wrongful conduct; (2) crimes that
are intended to impede the trial of the charged crime or unlawful conduct, such as subornation of perjury, obstruction
of justice, jury tampering, or murder, assault, or intimidation of witnesses; and (3) conduct that is a continuation
of the charged crime, such as a conspiracy or scheme to defraud that continues past the time of indictment. The new or
additional criminal or wrongful activity may have occurred in the past or may be ongoing at the time of the investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By definition, communications pursuant to this exception will take place when the represented party is the subject
of pending criminal or civil enforcement charges for which he or she is represented by counsel. Government attorneys
must take extreme care to avoid violating the Sixth Amendment right to counsel whenever they invoke this exception
in the criminal context. In particular, care must be taken to avoid the deliberate elicitation of incriminating information
regarding any pending criminal charges.

] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). Paragraph (f)
recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties
in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances
and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception has three requirements: (1) The attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety
or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against
the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication
is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception
is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example,
the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under
ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must
be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However,
information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with Constitutional limitations.

directly or indirectly, with a represented person unless the contact is prohibited by some other provision of federal
law. These communications are subject, however, to the restrictions set forth in &sect;&sect;77.8 and 77.9. Furthermore,
proposed changes to the United States Attorneys' Manual included in this commentary will provide additional guidance
to Department attorneys in such situations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section prohibits government attorneys from initiating or engaging in negotiations of certain specified legal
agreements with any individual who the government attorney knows is represented by counsel, without the consent
of that individual's counsel. Even when substantive discussions with a represented party or represented person
are permissible under these regulations, it ordinarily would be improper for a government attorney to initiate or
negotiate a plea agreement, settlement, immunity agreement or any other disposition of a claim or charge in the absence
of the individual's counsel. The one exception to this prohibition occurs when the communication is initiated by
the represented person or represented party and the procedural safeguards provided for in &sect;77.6(c) are satisfied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section is vitally important for the preservation of the attorney-client relationship.
One of the primary purposes informing Rule 4.2 and DR 7&hyph;104 is that an individual represented by counsel should
be protected from overreaching by an attorney for an adversary. The Department believes the risk of such overreaching
is greatest during negotiations over plea agreements, settlements and other key legal agreements. The training,
experience and knowledge of the law possessed by an attorney is particularly valuable in such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prohibition contained in this section includes all discussions of the terms of a particular plea agreement, settlement
agreement or other agreement covered by the section. However, this section does not prohibit an attorney for the government
from responding to questions regarding the nature of such agreements, potential charges, potential penalties or
other subjects related to such agreements during an otherwise permissible discussion. Nevertheless, an attorney
for the government should take care in such situations not to go beyond providing information on these and similar
subjects and should generally refer the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion of these issues.
The government attorney should also make it clear that he or she will not negotiate any agreement with respect to the
disposition of criminal charges, civil claims or potential charges or claims or immunity without the presence or
consent of counsel.

When an attorney for the government communicates with a represented party pursuant to one or more of the exceptions
listed in &sect;77.6, or with a represented person pursuant to &sect;77.7, the communication is nevertheless subject
to the restrictions of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Rule 4.2 protect a represented party's right, if he or she so chooses, to communicate with
his or her adversary only through counsel. The rules do not compel one to make that choice, and the represented party
may elect to speak directly with the government despite his or her attorney's advice not to do so. As a further protective
measure, federal courts have recognized that it is improper for an attorney for the government to disparage counsel
for the represented party or otherwise to seek to disrupt the relationship between that party and his attorney. See,

those basic principles by prohibiting communications that: (1) Attempt to elicit information regarding lawful
defense strategies; (2) disparage the represented party's counsel; or (3) otherwise disrupt the attorney-client
relationship. These prohibitions apply in every phase of criminal and civil enforcement investigations and proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the paragraph also accommodates an important exception to this prohibition. Courts have held that a government
attorney may not permit legal proceedings to go forward if he or she is aware of a conflict of interest between a represented
party and his or her lawyer. See

, 786 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1986). Under these circumstances, the attorney for the government ordinarily should move
to disqualify the lawyer involved, if legal proceedings have already commenced. If it is not feasible to move for disqualification
or otherwise challenge the representation, this paragraph allows an attorney for the government to communicate
with the represented individual for the limited purpose of apprising the represented individual of the perceived
conflict. However, any substantive discussion of the subject matter of the representation is permissible only insofar
as it is authorized by some other provision of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that this provision is used only in rare circumstances, the rule would require prior authorization
for such communications from the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General,
an Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney. The authorization should be in writing if at all possible.
Furthermore, before providing approval, the authorizing officer must find: (1) A substantial likelihood of a conflict;
and (2) that it is not feasible to obtain a court order on the matter.

The attendance of an undercover agent or a cooperating witness at lawful meetings of an individual and his or her attorneys
is ordinarily an improper intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. The courts have recognized, however,
that such attendance occasionally will be required when the operative is invited to participate and his or her refusal
to do so would effectively reveal his or her connection to the government. See, e.g.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attendance at such meetings, however, intrudes into the attorney-client relationship and impairs the right of the
defendant to a fair trial. Accordingly, this section provides that undercover agents or cooperating witnesses may
participate in such meetings, but only when requested to do so by the defense and when reasonably necessary to protect
their safety or life, or the confidentiality of an undercover operation. See Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 557 (informant
went to meeting ``not to spy, but because he was asked and because the State was interested in retaining his undercover
services on other matters and it was therefore necessary to avoid raising the suspicion that he was in fact the informant
whose existence [the defendant and his counsel] already suspected''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, even when an undercover operative's attendance at such a meeting is authorized to protect his or her cover
and safety, any information acquired regarding lawful defense strategy or trial preparation may not be communicated
to government attorneys or otherwise used to the substantial detriment of the represented party. See Weatherford,
429 U.S. at 558; Ginsberg, 758 F.2d at 833; Mastroianni, 749 F.2d at 906. As a safeguard, this rule provides that such
information should not be communicated to the attorneys for the government or law enforcement agents who are participating
in the trial of the pending criminal charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When there is reasonable cause to believe that the purpose of the meeting is not the lawful defense of the underlying
charges, but the commission of a new or additional crime (such as bribery of a witness or subordination of perjury),
attendance by informants or undercover agents at attorney-client meetings is permissible pursuant to &sect;77.6(e).
The belief, however, must be based on reasonable cause, not mere suspicion or conjecture. See Mastroianni, 749 F.2d
at 906. Furthermore, the prohibition against communication of lawful defense strategy to the prosecution should
be observed if, in fact, such strategy is imparted to the informant or agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government attorneys should give serious consideration to the extreme sensitivity of permitting agent and informant
attendance at defense meetings. Agents and informants should be instructed to avoid participating in such meetings,
and to minimize their participation when attendance is required, if it is possible to do so without arousing suspicion.
Agents or witnesses who attend defense meetings should also be instructed to avoid taking any role in the shaping of
defense strategy or trial preparations. Finally, agents and informants should be instructed to avoid imparting
defense strategy or trial preparation information to any other law enforcement officials if reasonably feasible
to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this restriction applies only to law enforcement officials and cooperating witnesses who are acting as
``agents for the government'' at the time of the communication. If one of several co-defendants who attended an attorney-client
defense strategy meeting later testifies for the government at trial, no violation will have occurred as long as the
co-defendant was not a government agent at the time of the meeting.

Section 77.10&blank;Organizations and Employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is similar in structure to &sect;77.13 of the previously published proposal. However, it includes several
substantive changes based on comments received during earlier comment periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue addressed by this section_when should a communication with an employee or member of a represented organization
be considered a communication with the organization itself_is one of the most difficult issues addressed by these
regulations. It was also perhaps the most commented upon provision during the comment period. Several federal prosecutors
commented that they regularly encounter attorneys who assert that they represent every individual in a large corporation
or organization. Others stated that these blanket claims of representation extend to all the former employees as
well. These prosecutors argued for a bright line rule to prevent such abuse and generally commented favorably on the
earlier proposal. Others argued that the earlier proposal was too narrow in scope and would deprive corporations
and other organizations of the effective assistance of counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section, and particularly the definition of ``controlling individual'' in &sect;77.10(a),
strikes an appropriate balance, one that ensures government attorneys the ability to enforce federal law, while
preserving the opportunity for corporations and other organizations to secure effective assistance of counsel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paragraph (a): Communications With Current Employees; Organizational Representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph states that a communication with a current employee of an organizational party or person should be
treated as a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling individual.
If a communication with a current employee is considered to be a communication with a represented organization under
these rules (that is, if the communication is with a controlling individual), then that communication is subject
to the same limitations that would apply if the communication were directly with the represented organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accord with the basic structure of this part, which distinguishes between represented parties and represented
persons, this paragraph effectively provides that when an organization is a represented party, an attorney for the
government shall not communicate, or cause another to communicate (subject to the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.6),
with any controlling individual of the organization without the consent of the organization's attorney. In contrast,
when an organization qualifies as a represented person, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause
another to communicate, with any controlling individual if the communication does not involve negotiations of a
plea agreement, settlement, statutory or non-statutory immunity agreement, or other disposition of actual or potential
criminal charges or civil enforcement claims, or sentences or penalties, as prohibited by &sect;77.8, and if the
communication does not violate the provisions of &sect;77.9.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``controlling individual'' is intended to encompass those individuals who typically are part
of the organization's control group. A controlling individual under this definition must: (1) Be a current employee
or member of the organization; (2) hold a high level position with the organization; (3) participate ``as a decision
maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject
matter''; and (4) be known by the government to be engaged in such activities. This definition attempts to identify
those limited number of individuals affiliated with the organization who actually are involved in determining the
organization's position with regard to the legal proceeding or investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are intended to protect the attorney-client relationship from unnecessary interference
and to protect represented parties from overreaching by opposing counsel. Communications with those high-level
individuals affiliated with or employed by an organization who are responsible for employing and directing the organization's
counsel and for determining legal positions taken by the organization are the type of communications prohibited
by DR 7&hyph;104. Accordingly, this paragraph defines ``controlling individual'' consistent with the principles
underlying the disciplinary rules on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of all the issues pertaining to 7&hyph;104(A)(1), the issue of organizational representation has engendered the
greatest confusion and disagreement among the lower federal courts. Courts considering the question have applied
a variety of modes of analysis, either singly or in combination. The Department believes the best approach is that
adopted by those courts that have attempted to identify an organization's ``control group.'' See, e.g.,

contacts with corporate defendant's ``control group,'' defined as ``those top management persons who had the responsibility
of making final decisions and those employees whose advisory roles to top management are such that a decision would
not normally be made without those persons' advice or opinion or whose opinions in fact form the basis of any final decision'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the ``control group'' approach most accurately reflects the values underlying DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)
and Rule 4.2. This approach properly seeks to identify those employees who exercise such sufficient authority within
the organization that communications with them should be regarded as communications with the organization itself.
The Department also believes that the alternative approaches would impose unacceptable constraints on federal
law enforcement.

Paragraph (b): Communications With Former Employees; Organizational Representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph authorizes communications with former employees of represented organizations. Because former
employees do not direct the affairs of the organization and therefore cannot be considered members of the ``control
group'' or any other controlling entity of an organization, communications with them are not considered communications
with the organization for purposes of the proposed rule. This reasoning is consistent with the conclusion of the majority
of federal courts that have held that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) does not bar communications with former employees of a represented
corporate party. See, e.g.,

Paragraph (c): Communications With Former or Current Employees; Individual Representation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph provides that if a former or current employee or a member of an organization retains his or her own counsel,
the government shall provide the same protection to him or her that would be provided under this part to any other represented
person or represented party. Communications with that individual are subject to the limitations set forth in this
part. Although this section provides the general rule for such communications, paragraph (d) addresses the specific
situation in which a controlling individual of a represented organization retains separate counsel.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph also provides that the government will not accept, for purposes of this rule, blanket claims by counsel
that he or she represents all or a large number of employees of the organization. It is important to note that this provision
is only relevant when the attorney for the government would be prohibited by some other provision of this part from
contacting an individual falling under the broad claims of representation under question. For example, an attorney
for the government may contact a low-level employee of a corporation, without consent of that employee's counsel
or the corporation's counsel, regarding a matter for which the corporation has already been indicted as part of an
undercover or overt factual investigation, if that individual has not been arrested or named as a defendant in a criminal
or civil law enforcement proceeding. Therefore, the fact that an attorney has stated that he or she represents that
individual will have no bearing on whether the communication is proper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a particular communication with an individual employee included in such a claim of representation would
be improper under these regulations if he or she were in fact represented by counsel (for example, communications
to negotiate a plea agreement), then this paragraph provides that a government attorney must first inquire whether
the employee is in fact represented before undertaking substantive communications with the employee. As part of
this inquiry, the government attorney is not required to disclose to the employee the fact that counsel has asserted
that he or she represents the employee. If the employee indicates that he or she is not represented by counsel, it is
proper for the government attorney to treat the employee as unrepresented. If the employee indicates that he or she
is represented by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, the attorney for the government shall treat
that employee as a represented person or represented party, and any further communications with that individual
shall be governed by this part.

Paragraph (d): Communications With Separately Represented Controlling Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph ensures that communications with a controlling individual of an organization that qualifies as a
represented party are subject to basically the same limitations, regardless of whether the controlling individual
has retained separate counsel on the same subject matter. Thus, this paragraph only applies in the circumstances
in which a controlling individual of a represented organizational party retains separate counsel. In such circumstances,
a government attorney may not communicate with the controlling individual without the consent of that individual's
separate counsel unless the communication satisfies one of the exceptions contained in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9
of this part. The paragraph also allows such communications if the individual does not qualify as a represented party,
initiates the communication, and waives the presence of counsel. Thus, the same rules apply to contacts with controlling
individuals of represented organizational parties who retain separate counsel as apply to controlling individuals
of represented organizational parties who are not separately represented.

Paragraph (e): Communications With Unrepresented Controlling Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph addresses a relatively narrow circumstance: when a controlling individual who is not individually
represented by counsel initiates a communication with the government outside the presence of counsel for the organization.
An attorney for the government may participate in such communications if: (1) The controlling individual indicates
that he or she is speaking exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not as a representative of the organizational
party; and (2) he or she indicates that the waiver of counsel is voluntary, knowing and informed and, if willing, signs
a statement to that effect. The fact that the controlling individual indicates that he or she is speaking in his or her
personal capacity does not mean, however, that incriminating testimony received from the controlling individual
cannot be used against the represented organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the controlling individual is also a named defendant in a civil enforcement proceeding or has been arrested or charged
in a criminal action, the requirements set forth in &sect;77.6(c) must be satisfied before any substantive communications
are made.

In order to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of the proposed rule, this paragraph provides
that the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce these regulations. Thus, neither state courts
nor state disciplinary boards may impose sanctions on a Department attorney for violations of this rule or state or
local rules governing communications with represented parties except as provided in &sect;77.12. This paragraph
further provides the framework for investigating allegations that a Department attorney has violated these regulations.
It provides that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (``OPR'') shall have jurisdiction to investigate
such allegations and that violations will be treated as matters of attorney discipline. See 28 CFR 0.39 (establishing
and defining duties of OPR). It also makes clear that the Attorney General's determination as to whether a violation
has occurred shall be final and conclusive except to the extent that the Department attorney enjoys a right of review
provided by other laws.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This paragraph provides that the proposed regulations are not intended and will not create any substantive rights
for any person other than an attorney for the government. In particular, a violation of the rule will not provide a basis
for the dismissal of civil or criminal charges or for the suppression of evidence that is otherwise admissible. This
provision accords with existing law. Traditionally, matters relating to communications with represented persons
have been treated as matters of attorney discipline without granting substantive rights to defendants or any other
persons. See, e.g., ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Preliminary Statement; ABA Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, Scope. Of course, when the communication with a represented person or represented party violates the Constitution,
the federal courts retain the power to fashion appropriate remedies.

Section 77.12: Relationship to State and Local Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Both DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are not prohibited
by the rule. Virtually all the states have adopted some version of DR 7&hyph;104 or Model Rule 4.2 that includes an ``authorized
by law'' exception. These proposed rules, as substantive regulations duly promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant
to statutory authority, have the force and effect of law. See e.g. Batterton

Francis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). Accordingly, communications with represented persons that are undertaken pursuant
to these rules should be considered ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of rules adopted by the various states.
Such communications will therefore be consistent with state rules wherever state bar authorities have adopted a
rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception. Furthermore, no conflict will arise between state and federal
law in those jurisdictions with regard to communications with represented persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those states that do not currently include an ``authorized by law'' exception or repeal current provisions, the
proposed rule may conflict with their provisions governing communications with represented parties. The second
sentence of this section provides that in those cases the proposed regulations will preempt the application of conflicting
state and local rules as they relate to contacts by Department of Justice attorneys. The longstanding position of
the Department is that the Supremacy Clause bars ``any attempt by a state bar association to impose sanctions on a government
attorney who is acting lawfully and in pursuance of his federal law enforcement responsibilities.'' See Ethical
Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op. O.L.C. 576,
601&hyph;02 (1980). It is clear that a Department regulation published after notice and comment constitutes ``federal
law.'' See, e.g.,

Accordingly, to the extent the proposed regulations conflict with state law, the regulations preempt the conflicting
state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section does, however, provide an important exception. If the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney
has willfully violated these regulations, preemption will not apply. As a result, a government attorney who willfully
engages in communications that violate these rules will be subject to disciplinary proceedings both by the Department
and by the appropriate state disciplinary authorities.

IV. United States Attorneys' Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the promulgation of the proposed regulations discussed above, the Department proposes to add several
new provisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual to provide additional guidance to Department attorneys when
dealing with individuals or entities represented by counsel during criminal or civil law enforcement investigations
and proceedings. Those provisions are set forth in full below as part of this commentary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to include some restrictions in the Manual while other restrictions are contained in the rule was an important
one. In the process of determining what the appropriate Departmental policy should be, it became clear that any regulation
would have to apply to a variety of circumstances, including: White collar and organized crime investigations, complex
conspiracy investigations, individuals whose counsel are paid by a third party, and individuals fearful of their
counsel for various reasons. Accordingly, the Department determined that the regulations should be broad in scope
and should provide unambiguous guidance that would not adversely affect federal law enforcement efforts. Thus,
the regulations distinguish between the investigative period before indictment, arrest, or the filing of a complaint
and the period after arrest or the commencement of formal proceedings. They also distinguish between communications
that are part of a factual investigation and negotiations of plea agreements, settlements and similar legal arrangements.
At the same time, the Manual revisions require that government attorneys consider the principles underlying the
basic prohibitions in a much wider variety of circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects all Department attorneys involved in criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings to adhere
to these provisions. Failure to do so will result in appropriate departmental discipline.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two especially important provisions that should be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, &sect;9&hyph;13.240 prohibits a government attorney from communicating with a person known to be represented
by counsel who the government attorney knows is a target of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation.
The Manual provides several exceptions to this general prohibition, including the following: When the communication
is initiated by the target; when the communication occurs at the time of arrest and the represented person has waived
his or her Constitutional rights; when the government attorney believes the contact is necessary to protect against
a risk to human life or safety; or when a senior Department official determines that exigent circumstances exist,
making the communication necessary for effective law enforcement. In addition, &sect;9&hyph;13.220 provides
an exception to the general prohibition if the communication is made in the course of an undercover investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Target'' is defined as a ``person as to whom the attorney for the government has substantial evidence linking that
person to the commission of a crime or to other wrongful conduct and as to whom the attorney for the government anticipates
seeking an indictment or naming as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding.'' Because an individual who
is a target of a federal investigation is typically in a clearly adversarial relationship with the federal government,
the Department believes that the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are implicated and an extension
of the prohibition contained in the rule is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its enforcement of this provision, the Department intends to give substantial deference to a federal attorney's
good faith judgment regarding the likelihood that a particular person will ultimately become a defendant. Even if
the attorney for the government believes that an individual will probably be named as a defendant, that individual
is not considered a target until the government has actually obtained substantial evidence linking that individual
to the commission of a crime or to unlawful conduct. The government attorney's uncorroborated belief that an individual
will ultimately be named as a defendant is not enough. Thus, an individual is not considered a target under this rule
until both the attorney for the government believes that he or she will probably be named as a defendant and substantial
evidence has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second provision that should be noted is the approval procedure provided in &sect;9&hyph;13.250. Under that
provision, before an attorney for the government communicates with any represented party or target, the government
attorney should obtain the approval of the United States Attorney if the attorney is an Assistant United States Attorney,
or the approval of another appropriate supervisor. The provision also permits contacts when prior approval is not
feasible, and requires post-contact documentation.

The entire text of the planned additions to the Manual follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28 CFR part 77 generally governs communications with represented persons in law enforcement investigations and
proceedings. This section sets forth several additional departmental policies and procedures with regard to such
communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Justice attorneys should recognize that communications with represented persons at any stage may
present the potential for undue interference with attorney-client relationships and should undertake any such
communications with great circumspection and care. This Department as a matter of policy will respect bona fide attorney-client
relationships whenever possible, consistent with our law enforcement responsibilities and duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules set forth in 28 CFR part 77 are intended, among other things, to clarify the circumstances under which government
attorneys may communicate with represented persons. They are not intended to create any presumption that communications
are necessary or advisable in the course of any particular investigation or proceeding. Whether such a communication
is appropriate in a particular situation is to be determined by the government attorney (and, when appropriate, his
or her supervisors) in the exercise of his or her discretion, based on the specific circumstances of the individual
case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the application of this section, like the application of 28 CFR part 77, is limited to communications
between Department of Justice attorneys and persons known to be represented by counsel during criminal investigations
and proceedings or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings. These provisions do not apply to Department
attorneys engaged in civil suits in which the United States is not acting under its police or regulatory powers. Thus,
state bar rules and not these provisions will generally apply in civil suits when the government is a defendant or a
claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attorneys for the government are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate officials in the Department of
Justice when the application or interpretation of 28 CFR part 77 may be doubtful or uncertain. The primary points of
contact at the Department of Justice on questions regarding 28 CFR part 77 and this section are the Assistant Attorneys
General of the Criminal and Civil Divisions, or their designees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 77.7 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, generally permits communications with represented persons
outside the presence of counsel that are intended to obtain factual information in the course of criminal or civil
law enforcement investigations before the person is a defendant or is arrested in a federal criminal case, or is a defendant
in a federal civil enforcement proceeding. Such communications must, however, have a valid investigative purpose
and comply with the procedures and considerations set forth below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the investigative stage of a case, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause another to communicate,
with any represented person, including a ``target'' as defined in section 9&hyph;13.240, concerning the subject
matter of the representation if the communication is made in the course of an undercover investigation of possible
criminal or wrongful activity. Undercover communications during the investigative stage must be conducted in accordance
with 28 CFR &sect;77.2(f), and relevant policies and procedures of the Department of Justice, as well as the guidelines
for undercover operations of the federal law enforcement agency conducting the investigation (e.g., the Attorney
General's Guidelines on FBI Undercover Operations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overt communications during the investigative stage are subject to the procedures and considerations set forth
in sections 9&hyph;13.230 - 9&hyph;13.233 and 9&hyph;13.240 - 9&hyph;13.242, below.

9&hyph;13.230&blank;Overt Communications With Represented Persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the investigative stage of a criminal or civil enforcement matter, an attorney for the government as a general
rule should communicate overtly with represented persons outside the presence of counsel only after careful consideration
of whether the communication would be handled more appropriately by others. Attorneys for the government may not,
however, cause law enforcement agents to make communications that the attorney would be prohibited from making personally.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28 CFR 77.8 prohibits an attorney for the government from initiating or engaging in negotiations of a plea agreement,
immunity agreement, settlement, sentence, penalty or other disposition of actual or potential civil or criminal
charges with a represented person without the consent of counsel. Discussion of the terms of a particular plea agreement,
immunity agreement or other agreement covered by the rule is prohibited. However, the attorney for the government
is not prohibited from responding to questions regarding the general nature of such agreements, potential charges,
potential penalties or other subjects related to such agreements. In such situations, an attorney for the government
should take care not to go beyond providing information on these and similar subjects, and generally should refer
the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion of these issues, as well as make clear that the attorney
for the government will not negotiate any agreement with respect to the disposition of criminal charges, civil claims
or potential charges or claims or immunity without the presence or consent of counsel.

When an attorney for the government communicates, or causes a law enforcement agent or other agent to communicate,

77.9 must be observed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the investigative stage, and absent compelling law enforcement reasons, an attorney for the government should
not deliberately initiate an overt communication with a represented person outside the presence of counsel if the
attorney for the government has provided explicit assurances to counsel for the represented person that no such communication
will be attempted and no intervening change in circumstances justifying such communications has arisen.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in section 9&hyph;13.241 or as otherwise authorized by law, an attorney for the government should
not overtly communicate, or cause another to communicate overtly, with a represented person who the attorney for
the government knows is a target of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation and who the attorney for
the government knows is represented by an attorney concerning the subject matter of the representation without the
consent of the lawyer representing such person. A ``target'' is a person as to whom the attorney for the government
has substantial evidence linking that person to the commission of a crime or to other wrongful conduct and as to whom
the attorney for the government anticipates seeking an indictment or naming as a defendant in a civil law enforcement
proceeding. An officer or employee of an organization that is a target is not to be considered a target automatically
even if such officer's or employee's conduct contributed to the commission of the crime or wrongful conduct by the
target organization; likewise, organizations that employ, or employed, an officer or employee who is a target are
not necessarily targets themselves.

An attorney for the government may communicate overtly, or cause another to communicate overtly, with a represented
person who is a target of a criminal or civil law enforcement investigation concerning the subject matter of the representation
if one or more of the following circumstances exist:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Determination if Representation Exists. The communication is to determine if the target is in fact represented
by counsel concerning the subject matter of the investigation or proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Discovery or Judicial Administrative Process. The communication is made pursuant to discovery procedures or
judicial or administrative process, including but not limited to the service of a grand jury or trial subpoena, testimony
before a grand jury, service of a summons and complaint, notice of deposition, taking of a deposition, administrative
summons or subpoena or civil investigative demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Initiation of Communication by Represented Person. The represented person initiates the communication directly
with the attorney for the government or through an intermediary and, prior to the commencement of substantive discussions
on the subject matter of the representation and after being advised by the attorney for the government of the represented
person's right to speak through his or her attorney and/or to have the attorney present for the communication, manifests
that his or her waiver of counsel for the communication is voluntary, knowing and informed, and, if willing to do so,
signs a written statement to this effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Waivers at the Time of Arrest. The communication is made at the time of the arrest of the represented person, and
he or she is advised of his or her constitutional rights and voluntarily and knowingly waives them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Investigation of Additional, Different or Ongoing Crimes or Wrongful Conduct. The communication is made in the
course of an investigation of additional, different or ongoing criminal or wrongful conduct that is separate from
or committed after the criminal or wrongful activity as to which the person is a target.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) Threat to Safety or Life. The attorney for the government believes that there may be a threat to the safety or life
of any person; the purpose of the communication is to obtain or provide information to protect against the risk of harm;
and the attorney for the government believes that the communication is reasonably necessary to protect against such
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Effective Performance of Law Enforcement Functions. The Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the

circumstances exist such that, after giving due regard to the importance as reflected in 28 CFR part 77 and this section
of avoiding any undue interference with the attorney-client relationship, the direct communication with a represented
party is necessary for effective law enforcement; and (ii) authorizes the communication. Communications with represented

Before communicating, or causing another to communicate, with a target the attorney for the government knows is represented
by counsel regarding the subject matter of the communication, the attorney for the government should write a memorandum
describing the facts of the case and the nature of the intended communication. The memorandum should be sent to and
approved by the appropriate supervisor before the communication occurs. In United States Attorney's Offices, the
memorandum should be reviewed and approved by the United States Attorney. If the circumstances of the communication
are such that prior approval is not feasible, the attorney for the government should write a memorandum as soon after
the communication as practicable and provide a copy of the memorandum to the appropriate supervisor. This memo should
also set forth why it was not feasible to obtain prior approval. The provisions of this section do not apply if the communication
with the represented target is made at the time of arrest pursuant to section 9&hyph;13.241(d).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that its attorneys perform their duties in accordance with
the highest ethical standards. The purpose of this part is to provide a comprehensive, clear, and uniform set of rules
governing the circumstances under which Department of Justice attorneys may communicate or cause others to communicate
with persons known to be represented by counsel in the course of law enforcement investigations and proceedings.
This part ensures the Department's ability to enforce federal law effectively and ethically, consistent with the
principles underlying Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, while eliminating
the uncertainty and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations given to that rule and analogous rules
by state and federal courts and by bar association organizations and committees. (Copies of the ABA Model Rule are
available through Order Fullfillment Office, American Bar Association, 750 North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL
60611.

516; to direct officers of the Department to conduct grand jury proceedings and other civil and criminal legal proceedings,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 515(a); to supervise litigation and to direct Department officers in the discharge of their

prosecute offenses against the United States, to prosecute civil actions, suits, and proceedings in which the United
States is concerned, and to perform such other functions in an appropriate and ethical manner as may be provided by

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an attorney for the government communicates, or causes a law enforcement agent or cooperating witness to communicate,

of counsel, the following restrictions must be observed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deference to attorney-client relationship. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An attorney for the government, or anyone acting at his or her direction may not, when communicating with a represented
person or represented party: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Inquire about information regarding lawful defense strategy or legal arguments of counsel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Disparage counsel for a represented person or represented party or otherwise seek to induce the person to forgo
representation or to disregard the advice of the person's attorney; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Otherwise improperly seek to disrupt the relationship between the represented person or represented party
and counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A substantial likelihood that there exists a significant conflict of interest between a represented person or party
and his or her attorney; and that it is not feasible to obtain a judicial order challenging the representation, then
an attorney for the government with prior written authorization from an official identified above may apprise the
person of the nature of the perceived conflict of interest, unless the exigencies of the situation permit only prior
oral authorization, in which case such oral authorization shall be memorialized in writing as soon thereafter as
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Attorney-client meetings. An attorney for the government may not direct or cause an undercover law enforcement
agent or cooperating witness to attend or participate in lawful attorney-client meetings or communications, except
when the agent or witness is requested to do so by the represented person or party, defense counsel, or another person
affiliated or associated with the defense, and when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of the agent or witness
or the confidentiality of an undercover operation. If the agent or witness attends or participates in such meetings,
any information regarding lawful defense strategy or trial preparation imparted to the agent or witness shall not
be communicated to attorneys for the government or to law enforcement agents who are directly participating in the
ongoing investigation or in the prosecution of pending criminal charges, or used in any other way to the substantial
detriment of the client.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with current employees; organizational representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A communication with a current employee of an organization that qualifies as a represented party or represented person
shall be considered to be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling
individual. A ``controlling individual'' is a current high level employee who is known by the government to be participating
as a decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation
of the subject matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former employees; organizational representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A communication with a former employee of an organization that is represented by counsel shall not be considered to
be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former or current employees; individual representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A communication with a former or current employee of an organization who is individually represented by counsel may
occur only to the extent otherwise permitted by this part. However, a claim by an attorney that he or she represents
all or a large number of individual current and/or former employees of an organization does not suffice to establish
that those employees are represented persons or represented parties under this part. In such circumstances, prior
to engaging in communications that would be prohibited under this part as a result of the individual representation,
the attorney for the government shall communicate with the individual current or former employee to determine if
in fact that employee is represented by counsel concerning the subject matter of the investigation or proceeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with separately represented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When this part would preclude discussions with a controlling individual as defined in &sect;77.10(a) and the controlling
individual has retained separate counsel on the relevant subject matter, an attorney for the government may communicate
with such individual in the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the controlling individual's separate counsel consents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the communication falls within one of the exceptions set forth in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case in which the individual does not qualify as a represented party, if the individual initiates the communication
and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not on behalf of the represented
organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel for the communication is voluntary, knowing
and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with unrepresented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an attorney for the government may communicate with a controlling
individual who is not individually represented as to the subject matter of the communication when the controlling

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Communications with represented parties and represented persons pursuant to this part are intended to constitute
communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model
Rules of Professional Conduct, DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, and analogous
state and local federal court rules. (Copies of the ABA Model Rules and Code are available through Order Fulfillment
Office, American Bar Association, 750 North Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60611.) In addition, this part is intended
to preempt the application of state and local laws or rules to the extent that they relate to contacts by attorneys for
the government, and those acting at their direction or under their supervision, with represented parties or represented
persons in criminal and civil investigations and litigation. This part is designed to govern the conduct of attorneys
for the government in the discharge of their duties to the extent that state and local laws or rules are inconsistent
with this part. When the Attorney General finds a willful violation of any of the rules in this part, however, sanctions
for the violation of this part may be applied, if warranted by the appropriate state disciplinary authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As published, the notice of proposed rulemaking contained an error in the docket number which would be misleading
and is in need of correction. This action is needed because the published docket number had already been used for another
rulemaking.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 24, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a proposed rule proposing
to impose sanctions on Illinois under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under the Clean Air Act as amended
in 1990 (amended Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit a basic and enhanced motor vehicle
inspection and maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision as required by the amended Act for the
Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. The Illinois General Assembly passed the legislation required
to support such a SIP revision and on January 18, 1994, Illinois Governor Edgar signed the legislation. Because of
this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994 proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary
sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994, in Chicago
and on March 4, 1994, in Collinsville.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3540), USEPA published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on Illinois under the
discretionary authority granted USEPA under section 110(m) of the amended Act for failure by the State to meet its
commitment to adopt and submit a basic and enhanced motor vehicle I/M SIP revision as required by the amended Act for
the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. The USEPA had notified Illinois by letter dated December
30, 1993, of its finding that Illinois had failed to submit the required SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Illinois General Assembly subsequently passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision and on
January 18, 1994, Illinois Governor Edgar signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing
the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling
the previously announced hearings scheduled for March 2, 1994, in Chicago and for March 4, 1994, in Collinsville.
This withdrawal terminates the discretionary sanctions process initiated by the January 24, 1994, proposed rule.
The mandatory sanctions process under Section 179 of the Act initiated by USEPA's December 30, 1993, finding that
Illinois failed to submit the required SIP revision is not affected by this action. Under that process, USEPA must
impose sanctions within 18 months of that December 30, 1993, finding of failure to submit unless Illinois adopts and
formally submits a complete I/M SIP revision within 18 months of that failure to submit finding.

This proposed regulation would revise the regulations governing the program for Grants for Faculty Training Projects
in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry authorized by section 777(b) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), to implement
amendments made by the Health Professions Extension Amendments of 1992 by: (1) Adding a definition for the term ``Geriatric
psychiatry'' to implement the statutory requirement for the expansion of project support to include the training
of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry; (2) adding a definition for the term ``Relevant advanced training
or experience'' to implement the statutory requirement for dentists who are awarded a 2-year internal medicine or
family medicine fellowship (Dentists must have completed postdoctoral dental training, including postdoctoral
dental education programs or who have ``relevant advanced training or experience''.); and (3) removing a section
in the regulations regarding the period of time for appointments to fellowships to allow for less restrictive requirements
for those individuals who may benefit from further fellowship or retraining experience in a life time. Additionally,
technical and ministerial revisions are being made to conform the existing regulations with the amendments made
by the statute.

This proposed rule amends the existing regulations for Grants for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine
and Dentistry, authorized under section 777(b) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 294o). The Health
Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408) amended and renumbered former section
789(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b)) to section 777(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 777(b) of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and enter into contracts with accredited
schools of medicine, schools of osteopathic medicine, teaching hospitals, and graduate medical education programs,
for the purpose of providing support (including traineeships and fellowships) for geriatric training projects
to train physicians and dentists who plan to teach geriatric medicine, geriatric dentistry, or geriatric psychiatry.
programs supported by these grants emphasize the principles of primary care as demonstrated through continuity,
ambulatory, preventive, and psychosocial aspects of the practice of geriatric medicine, dentistry, and psychiatry.

The proposed amendments made by the Health Professions Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408) to section
777(b) are described below, according to the section numbers and headings of the regulations they affect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 57.4102&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing to add the following terms to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Geriatric psychiatry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of mental disorders and disturbances seen in older
adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is adapted from the definition used by the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatrists and is
added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion of project support to include the
training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relevant advanced training or experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means at least one of the following: (1) Completion of at least a 12-month graduate training program in a health-related
discipline, the basic sciences, or education; or (2) a minimum of 2 years of clinical practice, of which at least 12
months were devoted in part to managing older dental patients in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other setting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition was developed with consultation from an Ad Hoc Committee of Geriatric Dentists and with positive
internal review. The definition is added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion
of fellowship eligibility of dental fellows in the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 57.4111&blank;Duration of fellowships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing to remove this section from the regulations. The regulatory language currently reads:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An appointment to a fellowship may be made for a period not to exceed 12 months. Fellowship assistance for participants
in a 1-year fellowship program and a 1-year retraining program is limited to 12 months. Participants in 2-year fellowship
programs may receive a second 12-month appointment for a total period of 24 months.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;408 no longer provides for a 1-year fellowship program. Further, the language regarding the
period of time for appointments to a fellowship is unnecessarily restrictive to individuals who may benefit from
further fellowship or retraining experience in a life time. For example, a faculty fellow who completed a 1-year retraining
to have the skills required to incorporate geriatrics into course content and clinical rotations may discover 5 years
later that another fellowship experience would provide the opportunity to develop research skills in geriatrics
required to expand the scope and depth of practice-based geriatric research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes proposed above, a number of technical, clarifying, and ministerial changes are included
to conform the existing regulations with amendments made by Public Law 102&hyph;408. These changes affecting the
program for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry are being made to the regulations to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Revise the section number of the Act from ``789(b)'' to ``777(b)'' wherever it appears in subpart PP, as renumbered,
and the United States Code citation from ``(42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b))'' to ``(42 U.S.C. 294o)'', in accordance with
Public Law 102&hyph;408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise &sect;57.4101, entitled ``To what projects do these regulations apply?'', by adding the words ``geriatric
psychiatry'' to reflect statutory language which expands project support to include the training of physicians
who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Revise &sect;57.4102, entitled ``Definitions.'', amend the following terms to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The statute repealed the Council effective October 1, 1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Revise the phrase ``by an organized medical staff'' to ``by an organized health care staff'' at the end of the definition
of ``

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' by removing the reference to a 1-year fellowship program which is no longer a statutory provision for project support;
and revise paragraph (2) of the definition to reflect new statutory requirements for the training of dentists who
have ``demonstrated a commitment to an academic career and who have postdoctoral dental education programs or who

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Revise paragraph (d) regarding the requirement that projects be based in a graduate medical education program
by adding the words ``or psychiatry'' after the phase ``or in a department of geriatrics'' to reflect statutory language
which expanded project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry. Paragraph
(d) is further revised by removing the phase ``in existence as of December 1, 1987'' at the end of the sentence, in accordance
with Public Law 102&hyph;408;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Revise paragraph (e) regarding the requirement that projects be staffed by at least two physicians in full-time

c. Revise the introductory text to paragraph (f) regarding the requirement that the project must provide fellows

individuals, to more appropriately reflect the language in Public Law 102&hyph;408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This proposed rule governs a financial assistance training grant program in which participation is voluntary. Because
these rules make minor changes in an existing grant program, they will have no consequential effect on the economy,
small businesses or small governments. Therefore, the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has decided to pursue the development of amendments to the Federal poultry
products inspection regulations to define and standardize, or establish other requirements for poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning, including possible provisions for the composition, characteristics, and use
of such products, and requirements for manufacturing and labeling such products. FSIS has formed tentative positions
on the provisions of such amendments. FSIS needs additional public input on the general approach and parameters of
such rulemaking in order to help the regulation development process. FSIS is interested in receiving information
from the meat and poultry industries and industry-related organizations, the scientific community, academia,
consumers and consumer groups, and other interested parties prior to undertaking any such proposed rulemaking.

Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical deboning are characteristically finely comminuted (i.e., finely ground)
in form and result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and
other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. The products are prepared from various materials, including
necks, backs, and whole carcasses. These starting materials may be raw or cooked, may contain varying amounts of muscle
and/or skin, and may contain kidneys, except when product is made from mature chickens or mature turkeys. Kidneys
of mature chickens or turkeys may not be used as human food (9 CFR 381.65(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology to mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue
of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses began in the late 1950's or early 1960's. The Department's initial reaction
was to consider the resulting product adulterated because of the amount of bone present and the physical size of the
bone particles. By the mid-1960's, the industry had modified and improved the equipment used to produce poultry product
by mechanical deboning such that product contained less than 11/2 percent bone solids with an extremely small bone
particle size. This prompted the Department to reevaluate its position. Widespread commercial production of products
containing mechanically deboned poultry began in the early 1970's. By 1975, poultry product produced by mechanical
deboning was being used as an ingredient in poultry and meat food products such as franks, bologna, salami, and rolls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today, poultry products produced by mechanical deboning are used in a wide variety of poultry products, including
cooked poultry sausages (such as chicken frankfurters, turkey salami, and turkey bologna), poultry patties and
nuggets (such as chicken patties and nuggets), and poultry baby foods. The level at which it is used has depended in
part on technological capabilities and has reached 100 percent of the poultry product portion of a number of cooked
poultry sausage products. Poultry product produced by mechanical means is also used at up to 49 percent of the formulations
of certain meat food products, e.g., beef and turkey chili, provided that it is identified in the product name as ``turkey,''
``chicken,'' etc., and used in meat food products including cooked sausages, such as frankfurters and bologna, at
a level of up to 15 percent of the total ingredients, excluding water (9 CFR 319.180).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, the poultry and meat food industries have also referred to poultry products produced by mechanical
means as ``comminuted (i.e., ground) poultry.'' Terminology such as ``finely comminuted,'' ``finely ground,''
and ``mechanically deboned'' have been used on poultry product labels to describe the form of the product according
to 9 CFR 381.117(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical means are subject to 9 CFR 381.117(d) relating to boneless poultry products.
This regulation requires boneless poultry products to be labeled in a manner that accurately describes their actual
form and composition. The product name must indicate the form of the product, e.g., emulsified or finely chopped,
and the kind name of the poultry from which it is derived. If the product does not consist of natural proportions of skin
and fat, as they occur in the whole carcass, the product name must also include terminology that describes the actual
composition. If the product is cooked, it must be so labeled. Section 381.117(d) also limits the bone solids content
of boneless poultry products to one percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by mechanical deboning also are subject to 9 CFR 381.47(e). This regulation requires that
rooms or compartments containing mechanical deboning equipment must be maintained at 50
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F or less during the mechanical deboning of raw poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations do not distinguish between boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning and
poultry products produced by traditional methods, e.g., hand-deboning using high-speed knives. Poultry product
produced by mechanical deboning is declared in the ingredients statement of a product in which it is used, along with
any other boneless chicken product used, as ``chicken'' where skin and fat are included but not in excess of their natural
proportions, or as ``chicken meat'' when such components are not included.

Report on Health and Safety of Mechanically Deboned Poultry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1976, the Department initiated an analytical program to obtain data on a number of nutrients and substances of potential
health concern in poultry products produced by mechanical deboning. Data were also gathered from scientific literature,
industry, other government agencies, and university scientists. Details of the analytical program and a resulting
evaluation were published in a June 1979 report entitled ``Health and Safety Aspects of the Use of Mechanically Deboned
Poultry'' (hereafter referred to as the 1979 health and safety report). An errata supplement correcting certain
items in the report was prepared and published on August 14, 1979 (44 FR 47576). (The June 1979 report and the errata
supplement are available for public inspection in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office.) On June 29, 1979, the Department
announced the availability of this report and encouraged interested members of the public to comment on its content.
The Department also notified the public that it was particularly interested in receiving comments regarding the
proper labeling of products containing poultry product produced by mechanical deboning and what means, if any, should
be taken to implement the labeling recommendations in the report (44 FR 37965).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department received 221 comments, most of which were general reactions to the labeling issues raised in the notice,
and health, safety, or economic concerns. Of the 187 commenters that expressed a general opinion on the adequacy of
the regulations concerning mechanically deboned poultry products, 175 were supportive. Some commenter stated
that the regulations have effectively controlled the use of product produced by mechanically deboning over many
years with a wide base of consumer acceptance, that such product is not significantly different from product produced
by hand deboning, that these regulations provide truthful labeling, and/or that the report and scientific literature
support the adequacy of current regulations. Other commenters indicated that mechanically deboned poultry should
be regulated the same as mechanically separated (species) (MS(S)) (then named mechanically processed (species)
product).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1983, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report recommending that the Secretary of Agriculture direct
the Administrator of FSIS to establish specific standards on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning and
labeling requirements on products made with such poultry products as had been done for MS(S) and products made with
MS(S). MS(S) is a finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone
from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses that meets the provisions of 9 CFR 319.5.

Improvements in Machinery for the Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical Deboning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency has monitored the advances in the technology for mechanically deboning poultry products over the last
decade. There have been improvements in the efficiency of the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone
from attached skeletal muscle and tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of poultry carcasses. Today, it has been estimated
that roughly 700 million pounds of raw poultry materials are used to manufacture mechanically deboned poultry which
is used, in turn, to formulate approximately 400 million pounds of poultry sausages (including franks, bologna,
and salami), and 300 million pounds of poultry nuggets and poultry patties.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 There have been major advances in mechanical deboning machinery in terms of the effectiveness of bone removal from
skeletal muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. This has been accomplished through
enhancements and modifications of the bone-removal devices that are part of the traditional mechanical deboning
machines. There have been continued refinements of certain operational parameters of the machinery, e.g., the ability
for operators to adjust the pressure needed to force ground poultry bones with adhering muscle and other tissues through
screens to separate muscle and other tissues from bone, and the size of the apertures (i.e., holes) in the screens and
sieves through which the ground bones, muscle, and other tissues are pushed. These improvements have resulted in
the ability to decrease the bone solids that are a result of the mechanical deboning process for poultry to less than
the one percent reflected in the current poultry products regulations (9 CFR 381.117(d)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1969, the Department amended the regulations for poultry and poultry products inspection to, among other things,
provide labeling requirements for boneless poultry products, including a prescribed bone solids content of not
more than one percent (34 FR 13991). This limit was based on an evaluation conducted by the Department of the operating
results in a series of poultry plants that used mechanical deboning equipment. Analyses were made of 485 samples of
raw, mechanically deboned product from nine commercial operations that used the three types of machines most often
used in the process. The analyses showed that the equipment, at that time, could be operated under commercial conditions
to produce boneless poultry that contained no more than one percent bone solids, on a raw weight basis, and the Department
concluded that it was demonstrated that it was practical to limit the bone content in deboned poultry to one percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the improvements that have occurred with regard to the machinery used to mechanically separate and remove
most of the bone from the muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS recently conducted
a study of the bone solids content of mechanically deboned poultry.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The percentage of bone solids content (determined by calcium analysis) in boneless poultry products produced by
mechanically deboning was collected from approximately 50 plants during August 1993, and represented a sampling
of over 2000 products. The data indicate that the mean bone solids content of the samples of these products was approximately
0.6 percent; generally, half of the percentages were above 0.6 percent and half were below 0.6 percent.

Prior Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 15, 1993, FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 33040) soliciting comments, information,
scientific data, and recommendations regarding the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry product produced
by mechanical deboning and products in which such poultry product is used. FSIS indicated it was considering the need
for rulemaking that would establish regulations on the labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning
and products in which such poultry product is used.

FSIS received 2744 comments in response to the ANPR, most of which were general reactions to the labeling issues. Two
thousand five hundred and ninety comments were submitted by consumers, 113 by food manufacturers/distributors,
17 by food retailers, 14 by trade associations, 4 by individuals from the Federal government, 3 by academia, 2 by food
consultants, and 1 by a law firm. The majority of the commenters responded to whether there was a need to identify mechanically
deboned poultry (MDP) in the ingredients statement on the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used as
an ingredient.

One thousand four hundred and eighty-seven commenters supported identifying MDP in the ingredients statement on
the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used. These commenters include 1452 consumers, 8 food manufacturers/distributors,
17 food retailers, 4 trade associations, 4 individuals, one food consultant, and one law firm representative. The
commenters provided the following general reasons why MDP should be identified on a finished meat or poultry product
label. They stated that: (1) Consumers have a right to know that MDP is present in a product, (2) meat and poultry products
should be labeled the same, i.e., there should be parity in labeling regulations, (3) MDP contains higher amounts
of ``calcium,'' ``cholesterol,'' and/or ``bone particles'' and, therefore, should be identified, and (4) MDP should
be identified because there is ``a difference'' between MDP and hand-deboned poultry. The eight food manufacturers/distributors
and four consumers also stated that consumers should be made aware (through labeling) that MDP contains ``kidneys,''
``sex glands,'' and ``lungs.'' The food manufacturers/distributors also pointed out that mechanical deboning
processes that crush or grind bones should be labeled as such, regardless of kind (i.e., species). Most of the food
manufacturers/distributors encouraged FSIS to work with industry's scientific experts and the meat community
to define ``meat'' and ``poultry'' through standards of ``product safety and nutritional composition.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining 1,257 commenters did not support identifying MDP in the ingredients statement on the labels of finished
meat and poultry products for the following reasons: (1) The Agency's current policy should continue and MDP has a
history of safe use for 25-plus years without labeling it as anything other than ``chicken,'' ``turkey meat,'' etc.,
(2) nutrition labeling will be a means of educating consumers about product composition and will address any concerns
with regard to the nutrient qualities of the products they purchase, (3) listing MDP separately in the ingredients
statement would mislead consumers into thinking they are purchasing products that are inferior to what they have
(historically) purchased, (4) any changes in labeling regulations on MDP would only serve to confuse consumers into
believing something ``has been added to their products'' when, in fact, no changes have been made, and (5) a change
in labeling would result in a severe negative economic impact ``on the entire poultry industry and U.S. economy, as
well as many U.S. trading partners that now use these items as a food source.'' One food manufacturer stated that beef
and pork are different species with obvious differences in bone mass, skeletal size, amount of calcification, and
bone hardness, and, therefore, MDP should not be labeled the same as MS(S), which incorporates bone and the constituents
of bone in the product. Some of the trade associations recommended that if MS(S) meets the same criteria for MDP in 9
CFR 381.117, it should be entitled to analogous labeling. Some of the trade associations also believe that MDP and
MS(S) should not be defined by the process used to make them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The academicians stated that the method of removal of meat tissue from bones of carcasses should not become part of
the name of the product, and, as long as the end products are comparable and meet the ``rules'' for starting materials,
composition, sanitation, etc., the method of processing should not become part of the product name. The commenters
also stated that MDP is an excellent source of protein and calcium.

FSIS's Response to the Comments on the June 15, 1993, ANPR and Issues Regarding Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical
Deboning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In its June 15, 1993, ANPR, FSIS solicited comments, information, scientific data, and recommendations regarding
the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning and products in which
such poultry product is based. FSIS did not receive any new data regarding the health and safety aspects of the use of
such products, and, therefore, FSIS believes that there are no new health and safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although, many of the commenters of the June 15, 1993, ANPR raised concerns regarding the labeling of calcium and cholesterol
contents of poultry product produced by mechanical deboning, the provisions of the nutrition labeling regulations
(58 FR 632) published by FSIS, which are to be effective July 6, 1994, would be a means of educating consumers regarding
certain nutrients and other components of processed meat and poultry products containing poultry product produced
by mechanical deboning, including calcium and cholesterol. Calcium and cholesterol declaration becomes necessary
on the labeling of most multi-ingredient poultry and meat products upon the effective date. These regulations also
establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient, raw products, and specify that FSIS will
evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant participation is not found, FSIS shall
initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under the voluntary program. Therefore, with
certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the nutrients in poultry products. Such information
will ensure that consumers are not mislead about the composition of products containing poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning.

FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exemptions including products produced by small businesses
and products in individually wrapped packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these
products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed
products purchased by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information
on single-ingredient, raw products, consumers will have information on calcium and cholesterol for most products
purchased for consumption at home.

Regarding the comments FSIS received in response to its June 15, 1993, ANPR on the presence of kidneys in poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning, FSIS requires the removal of kidneys of mature turkeys and chickens from their carcasses
before the eviscerating operations during the slaughtering process (9 CFR 381.65(d)). Kidneys of mature poultry
pose a potential health concern because of the possibility of the presence of certain heavy metals. Further, in regard
to the comments made about lungs and sex glands, these are precluded from being present in ``ready-to-cook'' poultry
(i.e., poultry subsequent to the slaughtering process) by the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 381.1(b)(44)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS acknowledges that many of the reasons provided by commenters for maintaining the Agency's current policy on
labeling poultry products produced by mechanical deboning are valid. However, a substantial number of comments
reflect the consumer's ``right to know'' that poultry product produced by mechanical deboning is in their food because
of the unexpected presence of bone. FSIS believes that these comments refer to the boneless poultry product produced
by mechanical deboning which has greater than 0.6 bone solids content, but no more than one percent bone solids content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is now considering issues in regard to the lack of a regulatory definition and standard for certain poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning_products which are deemed to be similar to mechanically separated (species) (MS(S)),
for which a regulatory definition and standard exist (9 CFR 319.5). (``Species'' refers to the species of livestock,
e.g., beef or pork.) MS(S) is defined as ``any finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation
and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses'' and meeting
the other provisions specified in 9 CFR 319.5. Provisions in the Federal meat inspection regulations provide, among
other things, a definition and standard that classifies MS(S) as a meat food product and a requirement that MS(S) be
separately identified in the ingredients statement of a meat food product in which it is used as an ingredient (9 CFR
317.2 (c) and (f), 319.1, and 319.5). FSIS's 1982 final rulemaking on MS(S) (47 FR 28214) indicates that the Agency
determined that material differences in the consistency and the composition of MS(S) place it outside the scope of
the product traditionally defined as meat (9 CFR 301.2(rr)), and that its differences are such that it should be defined
as a distinctive standardized product. As such, it should be identified by a name that adequately differentiates
it from meat, viz., MS(S). When MS(S) is used in meat food products, it must be separately listed in the ingredients
statement by its standardized name, e.g., ``mechanically separated beef (or pork).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, the meat and poultry industries have referred to poultry produced by mechanical deboning as ``mechanically
deboned poultry'' and ``comminuted poultry,'' and have declared the product as poultry or poultry meat (e.g., ``chicken''
and ``turkey meat'') in the ingredients statement of the labels of products in which it is used as ingredients. Several
red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that, without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning, a disparate situation exists between labeling certain poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products and may
deny consumers useful information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues, and has initiated two actions in response
to them. FSIS is contemplating proposing regulations on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, and is
soliciting comments and requesting data on various tentative positions in this advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
The other action is a proposal found elsewhere in this issue of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

bones to remove attached skeletal tissue of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses from livestock bones.

FSIS is considering, among other things, that certain poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, i.e., those
with greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content, but no more than one percent bone solids content, be separately
identified on the labels of products in which they are used as ingredients by a distinct name. However, because of the
improvements in separating the bone from muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS
is considering, among other things, that some boneless poultry products derived from mechanical deboning machinery,
i.e., those with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, be identified on the label of products in which they are used as poultry
or poultry meat, e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat.'' Until the Agency receives further data and information to
support this position, it cannot take a firm position on the content of a proposed regulation on this topic. Therefore,
FSIS is issuing this ANPR that provides an in-depth discussion, which follows, on the labeling of MDP, as well as other
issues related to boneless poultry product produced by mechanical deboning, and expresses the Agency's tentative
positions regarding these issues. It is FSIS's intent to obtain the information and data necessary to solidify its
position regarding the labeling, use, and production of poultry products produced by mechanical deboning.

A. Tentative position: Definition and standard of identity and composition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position is to prescribe a definition and standard of identity for the finely comminuted poultry
product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and
other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses which has greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content. While
whole carcasses sometimes are used, the starting materials for this type of processing frequently are parts of carcasses,
such as frames, backs and necks, which contain relatively low proportions of skeletal muscle, or parts, such as breast
frames, from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional deboning techniques. This
product is commonly known in the poultry industry as mechanically deboned poultry or MDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes under consideration would include (1) amending the Federal poultry products inspection regulations
by defining MDP as ``mechanically separated (kind),'' or another appropriate term, using limits for bone solids
content and bone particle size, and criteria for protein quality, and requirements for labeling of the product in
products in which it is used as an ingredient, and (2) amending the poultry products inspection regulations to require
that such poultry products produced by mechanical deboning be kept at temperatures of 40 degrees F or below within
2 hours of the deboning operation. The resulting product differs from poultry products produced by traditional deboning
techniques in its highly comminuted and spread-like consistency and in its content of bone and associated tissue,
as well as muscle, skin, and fat. These differences have a potential consequence for finished product microbiological
quality and, thus, for health and safety. Therefore, certain handling requirements may be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the differences between MDP and boneless poultry derived by traditional methods (e.g., hand-deboning),
it appears inappropriate to continue to include MDP within the category of ``boneless poultry products'' (9 CFR 381.117(d)).
Instead, FSIS is considering defining it as a distinct poultry product ingredient and standardizing its characteristics
under Subpart P of the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR part 381, subpart P).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative position is that the boneless poultry products regulation (9 CFR 381.117(d)) no longer would apply
to MDP. Consequently, the current restriction on bone solids content in this regulation_as enforced by limiting
calcium content_would be included with other compositional requirements in a MDP standard. Product failing to meet
the bone particle size, or protein quality requirements of the standard could be used only in producing poultry extractives,
including fats, stocks, and broths, (i.e., processors would be permitted to employ acceptable procedures for extracting
components such as fat, but such product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal process could only
be used for further processing). Mechanically deboned poultry with a protein content of less than 14 percent and/or
a fat content of more than 25 percent would be deemed to be product for processing. Moreover, as a standardized product,
MDP would be differentiated from other poultry product ingredients; and it would be designated in the ingredient
statements on finished product labels by the name specified in its definition and standard, in accordance with 9 CFR
317.2(c)(2) and (f)(1) and 381.118(a).

Tentative position: Product name. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position is to consider amending the Federal poultry products inspection regulations to define
the standardized product that results from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from poultry
carcasses and parts of carcasses by a distinctive name. FSIS is tentatively considering that ``Mechanically Separated
(Kind) (MS(K))'' is an appropriate, nonmisleading name for this product. It appears to accurately and concisely
describe the product, indicating the nature of the process by which and the kind of poultry from which it is made, distinguishing
it from poultry product ingredients produced by traditional hand-deboning techniques. The name under consideration
includes ``(kind)'' rather than ``poultry'' to make it clear that the kind of poultry (9 CFR 381.1(b)(40)) from which
the product is made is specified (e.g., ``Mechanically Separated Chicken''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously indicated, FSIS believes that MDP differs sufficiently from boneless poultry products produced by
traditional hand-deboning techniques that it should be regulated as a separate, standardized ingredient. As such,
this product would be defined by its own, distinctive name, and it would be referred to by that name in relevant regulations
and in labeling. In this regard, FSIS is requesting public input on other names that would accurately and appropriately
describe MDP as a distinct ingredient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is aware that other descriptions have been associated with poultry products produced by mechanically deboning.
In addition to the use of terminology such as ``finely comminuted'' poultry to specify the form of the product and ``mechanically
deboned'' poultry, such product has been referred to as mechanically separated poultry within the meat and poultry
industries. FSIS believes that where a primary distinguishing characteristic of a standardized product is its bone
content, it would be inappropriate to define it by a name that includes the term ``deboned'' and use of this term in labeling
might mislead consumers by implying such product contains no bone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons commenting on this portion of the ANPR should be aware that FSIS does not consider that current familiarity
with terminology or its appeal to consumers is dispositive on the question of what terminology is most likely to achieve
its objectives for the name of a standardized product: instantaneous consumer familiarity and acceptance cannot
and should not be expected when labels declare the presence of a product for the first time. However, consumer perceptions
are important in determining whether or not terminology that is technically accurate nevertheless may be confusing
or even misleading. When FSIS establishes a definition and standard for a product with respect to which a specified
name is deemed appropriate, the product must be called by that name in labeling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Bone solids content. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that a definition and standard for MDP would incorporate the existing restriction on the bone
solids content of mechanically deboned poultry products, viz., not more than one percent (9 CFR 381.117(d)). Because
this restriction is enforced by limiting calcium content, FSIS is considering that the definition and standard for
MDP should include maximum calcium content levels of not more than 0.235 percent in product made from turkeys or mature
chickens or 0.175 percent in product made from other poultry, as a measure of bone solids content_based on the weight
of product that has not been prepared with heat treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, FSIS adopted the one percent bone solids restriction after appraising the operating results
in a series of poultry plants using mechanical deboning equipment, analyzing 485 samples of raw product, and concluding
that existing equipment can be operated under commercial conditions to produce product which meets this limit (34
FR 13991, 13992). When processors applied the mechanical deboning technology to poultry products such as fowl frames
that have been heat treated using various cooking methods, FSIS modified its procedures to take into account weight
loss that can occur with cooking. Thus, the practice has been to permit an allowance for weight loss in order to reflect
the bone solids content that would have been present if heat treatment has not occurred; and the adjusted level may
not exceed one percent. The ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture (section 6.010F,
page 6&hyph;33),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 currently includes procedures for different degrees of adjustment depending on whether conventional cooking methods
(i.e., open kettle) or other heat treatment (e.g., pressure cooking) are used.

After evaluating data on substances of potential concern that may tend to concentrate in bone, the 1979 report on health
and safety aspects of the use of mechanically deboned poultry did not recommend any change in the existing bone solids
limit. (The report did, however, recommend limitations on the use of product made from fowl because of bone constituents
like fluoride; FSIS's tentative position is to amend the poultry products inspection regulations accordingly,
as discussed below.) Because enforcement is based on calcium content analyses, rather than direct measurements
of bone solids, FSIS is considering that an amended regulation would include the maximum amount of calcium permitted
in determining whether mechanically deboned poultry is in compliance. As discussed below, FSIS is also considering
that production under an approved quality control program is needed to assure that such product is manufactured to
comply with regulatory requirements on a consistent basis and that implementation of a quality control program would
increase the effectiveness of enforcement of the restriction on bone solids content.

FSIS has developed two different calcium content levels for this purpose. Both of these levels account for the fact
that poultry tissues, other than bone, contain some calcium. The higher level_0.235 percent_reflects the greater
proportion of calcium in the bones of mature chickens and turkeys as compared with young chickens (i.e., the lower
ratio of bone solids to calcium). The lower level_0.175 percent_has been used by FSIS in enforcing the one percent
restriction on product made from young chickens. Both of these calcium levels are equivalent to one percent bone solids
using the conversion formulas for calculating bone solids from calcium on a weight basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since FSIS is considering proposing a definition and standard that includes potential types of mechanically deboned
product, FSIS's tentative position is to allow 0.175 percent calcium as the maximum for all MDP that is made from poultry
other than turkeys or mature chickens. FSIS is interested in receiving comments regarding the calcium levels applicable
to MDP made from other kinds of poultry, e.g., ducks, geese, and guineas, especially calcium levels applicable to
mature poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the ``Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook'' (section 6.010F, page 6&hyph;33) has been revised to include
a procedure that could be applied to mechanically deboned product made only in part from mature chickens. That procedure
involves a determination of the relative mature and young chicken proportions when product is made from a combination
of young and mature chickens. FSIS is considering, as discussed below, that production of MDP under an approved quality
control program is necessary to assure consistent compliance with regulatory requirements, including the calcium
content requirement utilized in restricting bone solids content. Therefore, as the discussion of the proposed quality
control provision indicates, FSIS's tentative position is that, if mechanically deboned chicken is made from a combination
of young and mature chickens, the application of any intermediate value between 0.175 and 0.235 percent in verifying
compliance would be contingent upon an establishment's program for quality control including methods that support
such value's appropriateness as a measure of a bone solids content to not more than one percent; and without such methods,
the 0.175 percent limit should apply. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the determination of the calcium levels associated
with MDP made from a combination of young and mature poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of these calcium content levels in the definition and standard FSIS is considering should not be misinterpreted
as indicating a concern about the amount of the essential nutrient calcium that is provided by poultry and meat food
products. FSIS agrees with the findings in the 1979 health and safety report that, even assuming all further processed
poultry were made with mechanically deboned poultry (i.e., a far greater level of production and use than actually
occurs), the projected calcium contribution such products would represent only a negligible increase in per capita
daily intakes and cannot be considered hazardous, particularly since the dietary intake of a large sector of the population
may be below the recommended level of calcium consumption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Bone particle size. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering restricting the size of the bone particles in MDP to a maximum of less than 1.5 millimeter (mm) in
the greatest dimension, but permitting up to 5 bone particles per 50 grams of MDP to be from 1.5 mm to less to 2.0 mm in the
greatest dimension. The need to limit the size of bone particles in MDP has been acknowledged since the poultry industry
began to use mechanical methods for manufacturing this product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1979 health and safety report, it was recommended that bone particle size be controlled to ensure that equipment
type of processing does not result in unacceptably large fragments and concluded that, provided this is done, the
bone particles in the product will not present any health hazard because of size or hardness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that it is appropriate to permit up to 5 particles per 50 grams of product to be from 1.5 mm to less
than 2.0 mm as an acceptable defect in complying product. FSIS is requesting comments and information on the extent
to which manufacturers should be required to control the production of mechanically separated poultry product to
limit the size of bone particles. FSIS will consider any information submitted during the comment period on the size
and distribution of bone particles that may occur with various mechanical deboning procedures conducted in accordance
with good manufacturing practices (e.g., the extent to which deviations or nonconforming particles occur, and data
substantiating the absence of potential health or finished product quality problems with such particles).

Tentative position: Protein quality. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering requiring that MDP meet a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement
an alternative measurement_the content of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino
acids present. Protein quality is a measure of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids
in food protein and a measure of the ability of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regulation on MS(S) (a finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of
most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses that meets the provisions
of 9 CFR 319.5) was published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein quality was the
Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source to support growth
in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method for measuring protein
quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human dietary needs, in its final
regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility_corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990 (PDCAAS method).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility_corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption that the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering proposing a requirement that the protein in MDP have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent. This value is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements
for protein in foods for children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which
is cross-referenced in its final nutrition regulations (58 CFR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes this value
protects the young consumer from inadequate nutrition and from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein that
does not meet the dietary needs for growth), and in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS also believes
that it may be appropriate to assure comparability of MDP with boneless poultry and poultry that is derived by hand-deboning
in terms of the protein contributed to human dietary needs to maintain the quality and integrity of the poultry products
supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is considering proposing that, for the purpose of measuring
the protein quality of MDP, an alternative measurement of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the
protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential
amino acid content of MDP'' and ``total amino acids present in MDP.'' Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine,
leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and the total amino acids present including
isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine,
alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content. It is being considered
that the essential amino acid content would be determined by methods given in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report
of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that MDP found to be in compliance by the proposed amino acid content measurement would have protein
of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation of an Expert Work Group that was organized
by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with the University of Maryland, to develop recommendations
based on available scientific knowledge for consideration in policy decisions regarding the protein quality of
meat, poultry, and their products.

The public should be aware that FSIS continues to have interest in investigations of protein quality which include
among their objectives the identification of improved methods for determining protein quality. In evaluating the
possible use of alternative approaches to assuring protein quality, FSIS will consider data and other comments submitted
by the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Protein and fat contents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering allowing for two categories of MDP for use in the formulation of poultry products and meat food
products: (1) A category which meets minimum protein and maximum fat content requirements of not less than 14 percent
and not more than 25 percent, respectively, and (2) a category designated ``for processing'' for which there are no
protein or fat content requirements. As discussed below, it is contemplated that a wider range of use would be permitted
for product containing not less than 14 percent protein and not more than 25 percent fat, than for product for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques vary significantly in fat content, largely depending
on the extent to which they include skin (with attached fatty tissue) and/or separable fat_the major sources of fat
in poultry. A similar pattern was evident in the data on mechanically deboned poultry products reviewed in the 1979
health and safety report, although mechanically deboned product tended to contain more fat. This tendency is not
surprising since mechanically deboned product frequently is prepared from necks, which have a higher skin content
than other poultry parts, and/or backs, which have a higher skin content than other poultry parts, and because it can
include bone marrow, which contains as much or more fat than skin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, as with fat content, there is considerable variability in the protein content of both mechanically deboned
poultry and poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, in the data reviewed in the 1979 health
and safety report on MDP, MDP generally contained less protein. In addition, the 1979 report found much higher moisture
to protein ratios in mechanically deboned poultry, indicating considerable dilution of poultry product, possibly
by ice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the poultry products inspection regulations do not directly control the fat or protein content of poultry
product ingredients. However, they do differentiate between ``poultry meat'' and ``poultry,'' i.e., chicken meat
and chicken, with the latter encompassing edible parts such as skin and fat not in excess of their natural proportions
in addition to poultry meat. As skin (with attached fatty tissue) and separable fat are the places in which most of the
fat in poultry products is found and poultry products are composed essentially of fat, protein, and moisture, these
definitions have served, to some extent, to distinguish among poultry products in terms of their relative fat and
protein contents. Moreover, these differentiations in fat and protein have consequences for the use of poultry product
ingredients, since many of the standards of identity or composition for finished poultry products include minimum
poultry meat requirements (9 CFR 381.167) and others limit skin and fat to natural proportions (9 CFR 381.160).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal FSIS is considering is to develop a regulatory approach that fulfills its responsibility to protect the public
by maintaining the quality and integrity of the poultry and meat food product supply while continuing to permit flexibility
in the composition of mechanically deboned poultry product, as well as in its use at various levels in a broad range
of products. In FSIS's view, its responsibility to the public includes the objectives of preventing increases in
the fat content of this portion of the food supply and preventing poultry product dilution that could result in the
public no longer being able to rely on poultry products and meat food products as reasonably good sources of high quality
dietary protein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that MDP should have a fat content of not more than 25 percent and a protein content of not less than
14 percent or it shall be deemed to be product for processing. If these views are adopted, the effect of this provision
would be to impose no maximum on the fat content or minimum on the protein content of this ingredient where other regulatory
provisions assure that the fat content of finished products does not exceed appropriate limits and protect against
decreases in their protein content by establishing finished product content requirements. In such a product, it
is contemplated that MDP could be used, regardless of its fat or protein content, in ingredient mixtures that accord
with the standard for the finished product.

Tentative position: Quality control. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that a quality control program is necessary to assure that establishments manufacture mechanically
deboned poultry product that complies consistently with the tentative definition and standard that is being considered
by FSIS. Utilization of such a program in producing the ingredient MDP would be a prerequisite for the approval of labels
for products consisting of or containing MDP. The function of plant quality control is to restrict potential variability
within the limits of the tentative requirements FSIS is considering by controlling the factors that can affect the
resulting product's characteristics.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS expects to require that MDP be produced under an approved plant quality control program. Also, FSIS is considering
a requirement that the plant quality control program provide the controls and information necessary to assure that
MDP manufactured under such a program meets any requirements established and that it will enable establishment personnel
and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing on methods that will minimize inter-lot variation by maintaining
the uniformity of starting materials and controlling the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting
product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it appears that this goal can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control
incorporates appropriate methods and monitoring techniques and adheres to good manufacturing practice, FSIS contemplates
requiring that an establishment conduct only limited analyses for protein quality and fat, and for MDP represented
as containing not less than 14 percent protein and not more than 25 percent fat, to confirm that production is, in fact,
under control. After it has been demonstrated that the quality control program is able to yield complying product,
confirmatory analyses would be required only periodically, as long as the product is in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS anticipates establishing basic parameters for the chemical analyses that must be performed to verify compliance
with the requirements, e.g., defining production lots and sampling schedules, and the accepted methodology for
performing analyses. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the parameters necessary for an adequate quality control
program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Handling requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current regulatory requirements, including provisions for sanitation, operating procedures, and heat processing
(9 CFR part 381, subpart H and I, and &sect;381.150), already provide the basic controls necessary to prevent spoilage
and assure poultry product wholesomeness. However, because the mechanical deboning process presents greater opportunities
for bacterial growth than traditional poultry product processing, FSIS is considering amending the poultry products
inspection regulations to more specifically address the requirements for the various starting materials used for
MDP and the resulting product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the data reviewed in the 1979 health and safety report indicate that MDP products generally are acceptable
from a microbiological standpoint, the data also show that where bacterial loads tend to be higher, it can be attributed
to the starting material used. This is not surprising as common starting materials for mechanical deboning are products
that remain after the removal of a substantial portion of skeletal muscle or other tissue (e.g., skin) from poultry
carcasses or parts of carcasses. As a result, the resistance of the exposed surface area to microbial penetration
has been reduced and the ratio of the surface area to the volume of total product which is exposed to contaminating influences
has been increased. Higher microbial counts in MDP have been associated with the time and conditions of holding such
starting materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mechanically deboned poultry itself also presents opportunities for excessive microbiological growth because
it consists of small particles which have a greater surface area than most poultry products and because during its
preparation any microorganisms that are present are distributed throughout the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing
practices. FSIS is, therefore, considering that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials
used to make the product and for the product itself.

FSIS is considering proposing handling requirements that would provide that material to be processed into MDP be
processed within 2 hours from the time it is separated from the bones of poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, except
that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less, frozen at 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (^18

&cir;C) or less, or cooked. FSIS is further considering proposing that MDP be used as an ingredient in a poultry or meat
food product directly after being processed, except that it may be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4

&cir;C) or less or indefinitely at 0

&cir;C) or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS recognizes that different starting materials will be processed into MDP, i.e., poultry carcasses or parts of
carcasses chilled and maintained in accordance with 9 CFR 381.66; unchilled poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses;
and heat-treated poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, and such carcasses or parts from which a substantial portion
of skeletal muscle or other tissue has been removed. FSIS wishes to receive comments on whether specific handling
requirements other than those being considered are appropriate for specific types of starting materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in order to avoid confusion about the parts or physical state of poultry that may be processed into MDP,
FSIS is considering providing a definition of ``poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses.'' The terms ``poultry carcasses''
or ``parts of carcasses'' would apply to whole carcasses or disjointed portions of such carcasses that are ``ready-to-cook
poultry'' within the meaning of 9 CFR 381.1(b)(44) of the poultry products inspection regulations. In other words,
the head, feet, crop, oil gland, trachea, esophagus, entrails, mature reproductive organs, and lungs of the slaughtered
poultry have been removed and such poultry is free from protruding pinfeathers and vestigial feathers and suitable
for cooking without need of further processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that adoption of the handling requirements discussed above would eliminate the need to require
that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated
be maintained at 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or less. Thus, if the requirements FSIS is considering are adopted, FSIS would need to rescind 9 CFR 381.47(e).

C. Tentative position: Limitations on use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position is to establish and codify limitations with respect to use of MDP in the formulation of poultry
and meat food products. FSIS is contemplating imposing such restrictions based on the potential fluoride contribution
of MDP made from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens) and the characteristics of MDP, including the kind of poultry
from which it is made, its consistency, and its protein and fat contents. FSIS believes that such requirements are
necessary to prevent potential health and safety problems, and to maintain the quality and integrity of the poultry
and meat food product supply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Kind of product limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering that when a poultry product is required to be prepared from a particular kind or kinds of poultry
(e.g., chickens), use of MDP of any other kind (e.g., mechanically deboned turkey) should not be permitted. This provision
would assure that MDP made from a different kind of poultry is not used in a poultry product represented as containing
ingredients from a particular kind or kinds of poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tentative definition and standard for MDP that FSIS is considering covers MDP prepared from any kind of poultry.
FSIS is not considering, however, to permit use of MDP as an ingredient in any given poultry product regardless of the
kind of poultry from which it is made. Such action would be inconsistent with existing regulatory requirements and
interpretations and could, among other things, result in false or misleading labeling. For example, the definition
and standard for (Kind) patties (9 CFR 381.160) requires that poultry product ingredients be ``of the kind indicated''
(e.g., turkey products in turkey patties). FSIS believes that in considering to amend the poultry products inspection
regulations to provide for the use of MDP as a distinctive poultry product ingredient, this consideration should
not abrogate this type of requirement (e.g., to permit use of mechanically deboned chicken in turkey patties).

Tentative position: Limitations on product made from fowl.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering that the use of mechanically deboned chicken made, in whole or part, from fowl (i.e., mature female
chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)) should not be permitted in baby, junior, or toddler foods. Also,
FSIS is considering that it should not be permitted in combination with MS(S) to constitute more than 20 percent of
the livestock and poultry product portion of any other poultry product or meat food product. These restrictions are
based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. The 1979 health and safety
report found only slight differences between the fluoride content of MDP made from poultry other than fowl and that
of poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques, but considerably higher amounts in MDP made from
fowl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that, in addition to prohibiting use of MDP made from fowl in baby (i.e., strained), junior, and toddler
foods, MDP also should be limited in other foods, because infants also consume table foods, with most eating adult-type
foods by age 2. This would limit the potential fluoride contribution to dietary intakes of other young children in
high fluoride areas. FSIS believes that MDP made from fowl should be limited to a maximum of 20 percent of the livestock
and poultry product portion of any poultry or meat food product.

Tentative position: Poultry product limitations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering that the use of MDP should be limited in certain poultry products. FSIS is considering allowing
MDP in the sauce portion or any dressing of poultry products and is soliciting comments on this use. FSIS is also soliciting
comments on whether MDP should be allowed in poultry products for which there are standards of identity or composition
(e.g., Boned (Kind)_Solid Pack, Boned (Kind) with Natural Juices, Shredded (Kind), (Kind) burgers, (Kind) A La Kiev
and (Kind) Steak or Fillet).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MDP is a finely comminuted ingredient and FSIS considers its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics
associated with poultry products that have been processed only to the extent of cutting or grinding or that are made
from poultry products so processed, such as chicken breasts, turkey fillets, and chicken burgers, or shredded chicken.
FSIS also considers its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that
are processed, convenience versions of ready-to-cook poultry or cuts or solid pieces of poultry or poultry meat,
such as roasted chicken, boned turkey with natural juices, chicken an la Kiev, and turkey ham. FSIS recognizes, however,
that these types of products sometimes are prepared with components the characteristics of which are not inconsistent
with those of MDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is poultry meat_particular muscle(s)_that characterize cuts of poultry. The characteristics associated with
a cut can be retained when trimmings removed during processing are reincorporated; and the association with the cut
remains when there is chunking, chopping, or grinding of the muscle as in versions of turkey ham product (9 CFR 381.171).
FSIS regards these processes as different than using product made by the mechanical deboning of accompanying bones.
MDP does not, in FSIS's view, retain the characteristics of the cuts themselves. It appears inconsistent with the
basic characteristics expected of products represented as having been made from a particular part of the poultry
carcass, whether the muscle from that part is essentially intact or has been processed only to the extent of cutting
or grinding, to include this finely comminuted ingredient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same preparation procedures used in making a turkey ham product can be applied to other cuts, such as turkey breast,
for which definitions and standards have not been prescribed in subpart P of part 381 of the poultry products inspection
regulations (9 CFR part 381, subpart P). Cured turkey breast and turkey ham products have in common their method of
preparation and their association with a particular cut of poultry. They differ only in the cut of poultry product
used. As this difference is not relevant to whether inclusion of MDP would be appropriate, FSIS believes that use of
MDP should not be permitted in these products nor in products that are similar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is interested in receiving comments on its views as to the products in which use of MDP or its use in anything but
sauces and dressings should be prohibited as inconsistent with their basic characteristics, including data and
other information on the effects of using MDP on the characteristics and quality of specific products. Persons who
support allowing use of MDP in any of the poultry products covered in the above discussion should be aware that FSIS
is interested in their views.

(9 CFR parts 319 and 381, subpart P thereto), use of MDP ``for processing,'' i.e., MDP that has a protein content of less
than 14 percent and/or a fat content of more than 25 percent, not be permitted in the formulation of a poultry product
or meat food product at levels above 2 or 3 percent because of the effect on finished product quality. FSIS is requesting
comments regarding this approach and possible conditions for exceptions, e.g., when poultry and meat food products
are subject to a regulatory definition and standard which establishes a minimum requirement for protein content
and a maximum limit on fat content which ensure finished product quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS also recognizes that MDP ``for processing'' may be used at very low levels (2 or 3 percent) as a binder_i.e., for
a technological or functional purpose. FSIS is particularly interested in receiving comments on whether such product
should be permitted for this purpose and, if so, in what products and under what conditions. For example, would it be
adequate and appropriate to permit this type of use so long as it is limited to the 3 percent level in formulating processed
product?

Tentative position: Labeling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS expects to include special provisions for the labels of MDP and products in which it is used as an ingredient. If
adopted, these provisions would supplement other, more general requirements for such labels (see 9 CFR parts 317
and 381, subpart N).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: The product. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is considering the following possible labeling provisions for MDP: (a) The name of the product (e.g., ``Mechanically
Separated (Kind),'' must be followed immediately by the phrase(s) ``for processing'' unless it has a protein content
of not less than 14 percent and a fat content of not more than 25 percent, ``made from fowl'' unless it is not made, in whole
or part, from mature female chickens (see 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)), and ``with excess skin'' unless it is made from
poultry product that does not include skin in excess of the natural proportion present on the whole carcass (see 9 CFR
381.117(d)); (b) after any such required information, the name of the product may be followed by ``without skin''
and/or ``without kidneys and sex glands'' if it is made from poultry product that does not include skin and/or that
does not include kidneys or sex glands; and (c) there must be appropriate descriptive terminology if heat treatment
has been used in the preparation of such product. Because the characteristics specified are ones which would affect
use of MDP, FSIS is considering that, in order to assure compliance with regulatory requirements and thereby prevent
the adulteration and misbranding of finished poultry products and meat food products, it is necessary to provide
for their clear identification on the label when MDP leaves the establishment at which it is manufactured (see 9 CFR
381.115).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously, the regulations already require that information bearing on use_including deviations
from the natural whole carcass proportion of skin as well as the fact of cooking_appear on the label of mechanically
separated poultry product (9 CFR 381.117(d)). The presence of skin or its presence in excess of the natural whole carcass
proportion would, as discussed previously, continue to affect product use if the regulations are amended. The use
of heat treatment in the preparation of the product also would be of continuing relevance (9 CFR 381.157(a)). In addition,
since the presence of poultry kidneys or sex glands can affect use (9 CFR 319.180(b)), a number of manufacturers of
MDP not containing these parts currently choose to note this fact on the label. The other information that would be
required is identification of product made from fowl and product for processing.

As indicated above in the discussion of FSIS's tentative position regarding the definition and standard for MDP,
FSIS is considering that in view of the differences between MDP and poultry products produced by traditional hand-deboning
techniques and the developments since its introduction, MDP should be regulated as a distinctive ingredient with
standardized characteristics. Therefore, it is FSIS's tentative position to define such product by its own name,
e.g., ``Mechanically Separated (Kind),'' that would be declared in the ingredient statements on finished product
labels by the name specified in its definition and standard.

FSIS recognizes the importance of the identification of the calcium and cholesterol content of MDP to consumers who,
according to the comments received on the June 15, 1993, ANPR, indicated a desire to know of the presence of calcium
and cholesterol. FSIS wishes to point out that the effective date for its mandatory nutrition labeling regulations
(9 CFR 317.309, 381.409) is July 6, 1994. These rules require mandatory declaration of calcium and cholesterol content
on most processed meat and poultry products which will address this particular labeling concern. FSIS believes that
nutrition labeling is the most appropriate vehicle for conveying a product's nutrient content, which includes calcium,
cholesterol as well as other nutrient information.

FSIS is considering amending its current boneless poultry regulations to allow boneless poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to be classified as poultry or poultry meat if produced
under the provisions of a quality control program that would require compliance with certain criteria for this product,
e.g., protein quality, bone solids (calcium), and bone particle size. FSIS is also considering having handling requirements
and limitations on use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids in certain products. Further,
FSIS is considering that protein and fat content requirements would not be necessary, for such products, because
protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling of most multi-ingredient meat
and poultry products when FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations become effective on July 6, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is contemplating amending the labeling regulations on boneless poultry products to change the allowable bone
content for products currently labeled as poultry or poultry meat. The mechanical deboning machinery used to produce
boneless poultry products has undergone significant changes since 1969. Over the years, there have been continued
refinements in certain parameters, e.g., the ability to adjust the pressure and aperture size, resulting in far less
than current allowance of no more than one percent bone solids for mechanically deboned poultry. According to an August
1993 study done by FSIS
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 regarding bone content of boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, the average bone solids content
was approximately 0.6 percent. The changes in mechanical deboning machinery have resulted in improved manufacturing
processes. We believe it results in products which are comparable to ``poultry'' and ``poultry meat'' derived from
hand-deboning.

FSIS is considering provisions that will enable boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to
be classified as poultry or poultry meat and labeled accordingly. It is FSIS's tentative view that these products
need not be labeled to describe their form (i.e., consistency) by terms such as ``emulsified'' and ``finely chopped.''
FSIS believes that the form of the product may not be important because these products are primarily used as ingredients
in poultry and meat products, such as poultry sausages, which are themselves categorized as finished products that
are ``emulsified,'' ``finely chopped,'' etc., in terms of texture. Therefore, FSIS wishes to receive comments on
whether there is a need to include the term used to describe the form of the boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent
or less bone solids, e.g., ``emulsified,'' ``finely ground,'' etc., in the ingredients statement of the product
in which such product is used as an ingredient and whether these terms are important to the consumer.

Tentative position: Bone solids content.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering having the bone solids content of boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids
be measured by calcium analysis with a maximum calcium content of not more than 0.147 percent in product made from turkeys
or mature chickens or 0.111 percent in product made from other poultry. Both of these levels account for the fact that
poultry tissues, other than bone, contain some calcium and that turkeys and mature chickens contain more calcium
naturally than other poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering, as discussed below, that production of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone
solids under an approved quality control program is necessary to assure consistent compliance with regulatory requirements,
including the calcium content requirement utilized in restricting bone solids content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of these calcium content levels should not be misinterpreted as indicating a concern about the amount
of the essential nutrient calcium that is provided by poultry and meat food products. FSIS considers that, even assuming
all further processed poultry were comprised of boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, the projected
calcium contribution of such product would represent only a negligible increase in per capita daily intakes and cannot
be considered hazardous, particularly since the dietary intake of a large sector of the population may be below the
recommended level of calcium consumption. For the new boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids,
the calcium level would be significantly lower than mechanically deboned poultry.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Bone particle size.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering that the size of the bone particles in boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids
should be restricted to a maximum of less than 1.5 millimeter (mm) in the greatest dimension, but permitting up to 5
bone particles per 50 grams of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to be from 1.5 mm to less
than 2.0 mm in the greatest dimension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's objective is that the limitation imposed be adequate to prevent any digestibility problems while not restricting
the operation of equipment in accordance with the improved good manufacturing practices more than is necessary for
this purpose or to protect finished product quality. Bone particle size should be controlled to ensure that equipment
type or processing does not result in unacceptably large fragments and, provided this is done, the bone particles
in the product will not present any health hazard because of size or hardness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering that it is appropriate to permit up to 5 particles per 50 grams of product to be from 1.5 mm to less
than 2.0 mm as an acceptable defect in complying product. FSIS is requesting comments and information on the extent
to which manufacturers should be required to control the production of boneless poultry products produced by mechanical
deboning that have 0.6 percent or less bone solids to limit the size of bone particles. FSIS will consider any information
submitted during the comment period on the size and distribution of bone particles that may occur with various mechanical
deboning procedures conducted in accordance with improved good manufacturing practices (e.g., the extent to which
deviations or nonconforming particles occur, and data substantiating the absence of potential health or finished
product quality problems with such particles).

FSIS tentative: Protein quality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering proposing to require that boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids meet
a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed
as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement an alternative measurement_the content
of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino acids present. Protein quality is a measure
of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids in food protein and a measure of the ability
of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regulations on MS(S) were published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein
quality was the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source
to support growth in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method
for measuring protein quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human
dietary needs, in its final regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990 (PDCAAS method).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption than the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.

FSIS is considering proposing a requirement that the protein in boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less
bone solids have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent. This value is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements for protein in foods for
children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which is cross-referenced
in its final nutrition regulations (58 CFR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes this value protects the young consumer
from inadequate nutrition and from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein that does not meet the dietary needs
for growth), and in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS is also considering that it is appropriate
to assure comparability of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids with poultry that is derived
by hand-deboning in terms of the protein contributed to human dietary needs to maintain the quality and integrity
of the poultry products supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is considering proposing that, for the purpose of measuring
the protein quality of boneless poultry with 0.6 or less bone solids, an alternative measurement of protein quality
would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. This measure would
be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of boneless poultry'' and ``total amino acids
present in boneless poultry.'' Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and the total amino acids present including isoleucine, leucine,
lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid,
glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content. It is being considered that the essential
amino acid content would be determined by methods given in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids found to be in compliance by the proposed amino
acid content measurement would have protein of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation
of an Expert Work Group that was organized by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with
the University of Maryland, to develop recommendations based on available scientific knowledge for consideration
in policy decisions regarding the protein quality of meat, poultry, and their products.

FSIS tentative position: Protein and fat contents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is considering whether there is a need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat content(s) for boneless
poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids. FSIS has concluded that such action is not necessary because
protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling of most multi-ingredient meat
and poultry products upon the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 632). These regulations
also establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient, raw products, and specify that FSIS
will evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant participation is not found, FSIS
shall initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under the voluntary program. Therefore,
with certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the nutrients in poultry products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exceptions including products produced by small businesses
and products in small packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these products bear no
nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed products purchased
by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information on single-ingredient
raw products, consumers will have information on protein and fat for most products purchased for consumption at home.
Based on these considerations, FSIS maintains that there is no need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat
contents for boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Quality control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS believes that a quality control program is necessary to assure that establishments that manufacture boneless
poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids comply consistently with the criteria being considered. Utilization
of such a quality control program in producing the boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids would
be a prerequisite for the approval of labels for products consisting of or containing boneless poultry. The function
of a quality control program is to restrict potential variability within the limits of FSIS's tentative requirements
by controlling the factors that can affect the resulting product's characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS expects to require that boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be produced under an approved
quality control program. Also, FSIS expects to require that the quality control program provide the controls and
information necessary to assure boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids will meet each of the requirements
under consideration and will enable establishment personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing
on methods that will minimize inter-lot variation by maintaining the uniformity of starting materials and controlling
the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it appears that this goal can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control
incorporates appropriate methods and monitoring techniques and adheres to good manufacturing practices, FSIS
plans to require that an establishment conduct only limited analyses for calcium, protein quality, and bone particles
for boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids to confirm that production is, in fact, under control.
After it has been demonstrated that the quality control program is able to yield complying product, confirmatory
analyses would be required only periodically, as long as the product is in compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS anticipates establishing basic parameters for the chemical analyses that must be performed to verify compliance
with the requirements, e.g., defining production lots and sampling schedules, and the accepted methodology for
performing analyses. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the parameters necessary for an adequate quality control
program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current regulatory requirements, including provisions for sanitation, operating procedures, and heat processing
(9 CFR part 381, subpart H and I, and &sect;381.150), already provide the basic controls necessary to prevent spoilage
and assure poultry product wholesomeness. However, because the mechanical deboning process presents greater opportunities
for bacterial growth than traditional poultry product processing, FSIS is considering amending the poultry products
inspection regulations to more specifically address the requirements for the various starting materials used to
manufacture boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids and the
resulting boneless poultry product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing
practices. FSIS is, therefore, considering that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials
used to make the product and for the product itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is considering proposing handling requirements that would provide that material to be processed into boneless
poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be processed within 2 hours
from the time it is separated from the bones of poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may
be held for no more than 72 hours at 40

&cir;C) or less, or held indefinitely a 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (^18 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less. Within 2 hours of the mechanical deboning operation, FSIS is also considering proposing that boneless
poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be chilled to 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less, frozen to 0 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (^18 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less, or cooked. FSIS is further considering proposing that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone
solids be used as an ingredient in a poultry or meat food product directly after being processed, except that it may
be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less or indefinitely at 0

&cir;F (^18 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS wishes to receive comments on whether specific handling requirements other than those being considered are
appropriate for specific types of starting materials. In addition, in order to avoid confusion about the parts or
physical state of poultry that may be processed into boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, FSIS intends
to provide a definition of ``poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses.'' The terms ``poultry carcasses'' or ``parts
of carcasses'' would apply to whole carcasses or disjointed portions of such carcasses that are ``ready-to-cook
poultry'' within the meaning of 9 CFR 381.1(b)(44) of the poultry products inspection regulations. In other words,
the head, feet, crop, oil gland, trachea, esophagus, entrails, mature reproductive organs, and lungs of the slaughtered
poultry have been removed and such poultry is free from protruding pinfeathers and vestigial feathers and suitable
for cooking without need of further processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FSIS is considering that adoption of the handling requirements discussed above would eliminate the need to require
that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated
be maintained at 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. or less. Thus, if the requirements FSIS is considering are adopted, FSIS would need to rescind 9 CFR 381.47(e).

C. Tentative position: Limitations on Use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At a level of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content there is no need for consumer concern regarding potential fluoride
contribution of mechanically separated product made from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Tentative position: Kind of product limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS's tentative position on amending the poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less
bone solids covers such product prepared from any kind of poultry. It is not, however, FSIS's intention to permit use
of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids as an ingredient in any given poultry product regardless
of the kind of poultry from which it is made. Such action would be inconsistent with existing regulatory requirements
and interpretations and could, among other things, result in false or misleading labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS intends to provide that when a poultry product is required to be prepared from a particular kind of kinds of poultry
(e.g., chickens), use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids of any other kind (e.g., poultry
product made from turkey) should not be permitted. This provision would assure that boneless poultry product made
from a different kind of poultry is not used in a poultry product represented as containing ingredients from a particular
kind or kinds of poultry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) Tentative position: Limitation on product made from fowl. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the past, the Agency has had a policy of discouraging the use of MDP containing 1.0 percent or less bone solids content
for use in baby, junior, and toddler foods because of concern for higher levels of fluoride present in the bones of mature
poultry. However, FSIS believes that at the low level of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content there would be no reason
to place a restriction on boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids for use in baby, junior, and
toddler foods based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. Furthermore,
there is research to indicate a very poor absorption of fluorine from bone particles coupled with a large body of research
indicating beneficial effects of fluoride at lower levels. With the restriction of 0.6 percent or less bone solids
content, levels of fluoride present would not present a health and safety concern.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS anticipates permitting the use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids made, in whole
or part, from fowl (mature female chickens, as defined in 9 CFR 381.170(a)(1)(vi)) in baby, junior, or toddler foods.
The Agency is interested in receiving comments and supporting scientific documentation if there are valid, scientific
findings contradicting this view.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Poultry product limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids is comminuted, i.e., finely ground, in form,
FSIS is considering its use to be inconsistent with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that
have been processed only to the extent of cutting or grinding or that are made from poultry products so processed, such
as chicken breasts, turkey fillets, and chicken burgers or shredded chicken. FSIS also considers its use to be inconsistent
with the basic characteristics associated with poultry products that are processed, convenience versions of ready-to-cook
poultry or cuts or solid pieces of poultry or poultry meat, such as roasted chicken, boned turkey with natural juices,
chicken a la Kiev, and turkey ham. FSIS is interested in receiving comments on its views as to the products in which use
of boneless poultry product produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids or its use in anything
but sauces and dressings should be prohibited as inconsistent with their basic characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative position on limitations of use is intended to provide a mechanism for assuring that boneless poultry
products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids is not an ingredient in products marketed as classes or cuts of raw poultry
which have undergone additional preparation such as boning and/or cooking where regulatory standards currently
do not address their poultry or poultry meat content (e.g., boneless turkey breasts), as well as where they do.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS does not anticipate adopting any restrictions on the amount of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or
less bone solids that can be used in poultry products, or meat food products, in which it is a permitted ingredient.
However, standards for particular products may contain quantitative limits (e.g., the limit on the amount of poultry
product ingredients permitted in cooked sausages such as frankfurters and bologna (9 CFR 319.180)) or other restrictions
on the way in which various poultry product ingredients may be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative position: Finished poultry products and meat food products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated previously, FSIS is considering proposing that boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone
solids should be classified as ``poultry'' or ``poultry meat'' and that it should be described accordingly. Although
boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids is finely ground in form, it is expected that this product
would be used as an ingredient in products which are, themselves, categorized as finely ground in texture, e.g., frankfurters
and bologna. Therefore, FSIS is considering that when boneless poultry product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids
is used as ingredient in a poultry or meat product, it should be declared by terms that accurately describe it as a poultry
or poultry meat product, e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative position is not to require special declaration of calcium and/or cholesterol content on labeling
of a poultry or meat food product containing boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids because
calcium and cholesterol declaration becomes necessary on the labeling of most multi-ingredient poultry and meat
products upon the effective date of FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS's tentative labeling provisions reflect FSIS's belief that nutrition labeling is the most appropriate place
for calcium and cholesterol content information by requiring that the declaration of calcium and/or cholesterol
content appear as part of any nutrition labeling that a poultry product or meat food product bears.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by amending
the definition of meat to include as meat product resulting from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones to remove attached skeletal tissue from the bones of livestock
carcasses and parts of carcasses, establishing the criteria for meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and meat recovery systems to assure consistency with the characteristics and composition of meat, and establishing
requirements for the handling of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems,
as well as the material from which it is derived. This action is being taken to update the definition of meat to acknowledge
and include as meat product derived from the advances made in the modification of traditional mechanical means of
separating meat from the bones of livestock and the development of advanced recovery systems that do not involve grinding,
crushing, or pulverizing bones to remove the adhering skeletal tissue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing with respect to the premises, facilities,
and operations of federally inspected establishments any requirements that are in addition to, or different than,
those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, impose recordkeeping and other requirements
within the scope of section 202 of the FMIA, if consistent therewith, with respect to any such federally inspected
establishment. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA from imposing any marking, labeling,
packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different
than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction
over meat products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat
products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such
an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection
programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however,
impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of a program
official. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions.

Effect on Small Entities

The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This rule does not require either
large or small establishments to use meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems. Although there are
initial costs involved with the purchase of machinery and establishing quality control programs, there are no apparent
direct competitive advantages that large establishments would have over small establishments.

) requires that the Secretary of Agriculture administer an inspection program that assures consumers that meat and
meat food products distributed in commerce and within designated States
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 are wholesome, not adulterated, and are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under the FMIA and regulations promulgated
thereunder, FSIS provides mandatory inspection, except for certain exceptions, of meat and meat food products prepared
for distribution in interstate and foreign commerce, as well as for distribution within designated States.

Designated States are States that have failed to develop or are not effectively enforcing requirements at establishments,
within their jurisdiction, for the slaughter of livestock and/or the preparation of products thereof, that are at
least equal to those of subchapters I and IV of the FMIA. Once a State is designated, the provisions of subchapters I
and IV of the FMIA apply to the operations and transactions of establishments that operate solely within the State.

The part of the muscle of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats, which is skeletal or which is found in the tongue, in the
diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus, with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions
of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated
from it in the process of dressing. It does not include the muscle found in the lips, snout, or ears. This term, as applied
to products of equines, shall have a meaning comparable to that provided in this paragraph with respect to cattle,
sheep, swine, and goats.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal meat inspection regulations also establish a definition and standard of identity for a meat food product
called ``mechanically separated (species)'' (MS(S)) in 9 CFR 319.5. ``Species'' refers to the species of livestock,
e.g., beef or pork. At various times, this product has also been called mechanically deboned meat and mechanically
processed (species) product. This meat food product is defined as ``any finely comminuted product resulting from
the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and
parts of carcasses'' and meeting the other provisions specified in 9 CFR 319.5. This provision and other provisions
in the Federal meat inspection regulations provide, among other things, for: (1) A definition and standard that classifies
MS(S) as a meat food product, (2) limitations on the amount of MS(S) that can be used in permitted products (viz., 20
percent of the livestock and poultry product portion of the product), (3) prohibitions on the use of MS(S) in certain
products (e.g., baby food), (4) limitations on certain components of MS(S), e.g., bone particle size, bone content
(measured as calcium content), protein quality, and a maximum fat content and minimum protein content, (5) requirements
for handling and for the production of MS(S) under an approved quality control program, and (6) a requirement that
MS(S) be separately identified in the ingredients statement of a meat food product (9 CFR 317.2 (c) and (f), 318.18,
319.5, and 319.6). FSIS's 1982 final rulemaking on MS(S) (47 FR 28214) indicates that the Agency determined that material
differences in the consistency and the composition of MS(S) place it outside the scope of product traditionally defined
as meat (9 CFR 301.2(rr)), and that its differences are such that it should be defined as a distinctive standardized
product. As such, it should be identified by a name that adequately differentiates it from meat, viz., MS(S). When
MS(S) is used in meat food products, it must be separately listed in the ingredients statement by its standardized
name, e.g., ``mechanically separated beef (or pork).''

FSIS is considering issues in regard to the lack of a regulatory definition and standard for certain poultry products
produced by mechanical deboning_products which are deemed to be similar to MS(S). Poultry products produced by mechanical
deboning result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other
tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. Over the years, the meat and poultry industries have referred
to poultry product produced by mechanical deboning as ``mechanically deboned poultry'' and ``comminuted poultry,''
and have declared the product as poultry or poultry meat (e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat'') on the labels of products
in which they are used as ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry
products produced by mechanical deboning, a disparate situation exists between labeling poultry products produced
by mechanical deboning and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues and has initiated two actions in response
to them. FSIS is contemplating proposing regulations on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, and will
be soliciting comments and requesting data on various tentative positions in a notice that appears elsewhere in this
issue of the

. The second action is the subject of this proposed rule which focuses on the meat product derived from the advances
in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined
in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS now believes that advances in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems, which do not grind,
crush, or pulverize bone in order to remove skeletal muscle tissue adhering to bones of livestock (i.e., bones of cattle,
sheep, swine, and goats) result in a product which, unlike MS(S), is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the 1970's, there has been increasing commercial production of processed meat products that are formulated
with comminuted (i.e., ground) meat, e.g., hot dogs, in order to meet the demands of the market for such products. Most
of the technology that has found commercial use will evolve in the form of improvements to meet the demands of consumers
and industry. The demands of the industry have centered around the desire to harvest more usable protein, i.e., muscle
tissue, and to find alternatives to recovering more usable protein, from livestock carcasses to meet consumer demands
for the processed meat products formulated with skeletal muscle tissue obtained by mechanical removal. Mechanization
also diminishes the economic implications of removing meat by hand caused by repetitive motion disorders for workers
that hand-debone carcasses and parts of carcasses using knives, and by knife accidents. Industry data
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 indicate that over 300,000 cases of cumulative trauma disorder (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) have occurred in the
meat industry due to the strain of repetitive movements to remove meat from bones. The demands of the consumer and industry
have resulted in improvements in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems to improve yields and,
simultaneously, to make the process better ergonomically.

Over the past decade, FSIS has monitored the tremendous strides in modernizing the meat/bone separation machinery.
FSIS believes that there are meat/bone separators and meat recovery systems that are fundamentally different than
the machines used to manufacture MS(S). These differences occur in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of the
process of separating skeletal muscle tissue and bone.

The Removal of Muscle Tissue From Livestock Bones
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the advent of automatic means of skeletal muscle tissue removal from bone using high-speed knives, e.g., the
Wizard knife, machines that are classified as meat/bone separators have been developed that emulate the physical
action of the high-speed knives. The advances in meat/bone separation have led to recovery systems that separate
meat from bone without crushing, grinding, or pulverizing bones such that the meat is removed by shaving, pressing,
or scraping the muscle tissue from the bone surface similar to the action of the hand-held high-speed knives. Thus,
this meat is obtained in much the same manner as that which is obtained using traditional hand-deboning techniques,
where the bones emerge separately from the meat in the process, essentially intact and in natural physical conformation.
For example, the most commonly used bones would include rib bones and loin bones and would be recognized as such when
they emerge from the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS believes that the description of the bones from which muscle
tissue has been removed as ``essentially intact'' is consistent with the description of the bones resulting from
the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including high-speed mechanical knives, such as the
Wizard knife. FSIS recognizes that even with the use of hand-operated knives, e.g., in the processing establishment,
at the supermarket meat counter, or by the consumer, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close
to the bone surface so as to unavoidably remove a minute amount of the bone's surface when meat is removed. FSIS believes
that this is a normal occurrence because of the difficulty in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations,
and, as such, it is still in conformance with good manufacturing practices that render products safe and wholesome.
Because the bones emerge from the advanced meat/bone separators in their natural shape and structure, i.e., with
the connective tissue linkages that normally occur in bones, FSIS maintains that they are in natural physical conformation.
Furthermore, under FSIS's longstanding boneless meat inspection procedure for meat derived by hand-deboning techniques,
it is expected that the finished comminuted (i.e., ground) meat product made from the meat removed from livestock
bones contains no bone perceptible to sight or touch. This result would be expected for meat derived from the advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems.

In contrast, the mechanism of traditional mechanical deboning machines from which MS(S) results, involves mechanically
separating and removing most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock through the application of high
pressure to crush, grind, and pulverize bones from which most of the meat has already been removed, and then using high
pressure to force the resulting paste through a sieve to separate bone particles and fragments that result from crushing
and pulverizing bones during processing. Due to the mechanism of the machinery used to manufacture MS(S), bone and
bone particles, including bone marrow, are incorporated into the finished product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation on MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5 does not specify the type of equipment used to separate and remove bone because
it is intended to cover the product manufactured by any such machinery that operates on the differing resistance of
hard bone and soft tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices
and whether or not bones are pre-broken before being fed into such equipment. However, the regulation on MS(S) is not
intended to apply to whole pieces of muscle tissue which have been removed from livestock bones by mechanical or other
means (47 FR 28223). FSIS has determined that the consistency of MS(S) and its content of bone, including bone marrow,
and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue, are materially different from those of ``meat,'' and that these differences
have potential consequences for finished product quality and for health and safety which are addressed by the regulations
for MS(S) (9 CFR 318.18, 319.5, and 319.6) and supported by the Agency's 1979 report on the health and safety aspects
of mechanically deboned meat.

Starting Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The starting materials from which the meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems
results are intact livestock bones with adhering skeletal muscle and other soft tissue. While it has been reported
that it is possible to use whole carcasses, the raw materials for this type of processing generally are parts of carcasses
with skeletal muscle attached. Adhering skeletal muscle tissue usually varies in amount, depending on the anatomical
origin and size of the bones. Typically, the livestock bones with adhering skeletal tissue applicable to the advances
in meat recovery are those where the adhering tissue cannot be efficiently or effectively removed by traditional
hand-deboning techniques, and the bones are of sufficient hardness and of appropriate size compatible with the operation
of the advanced meat/bone separator/meat recovery system. It is FSIS's understanding that the advanced machinery
is capable of handling medium to smaller size bones, e.g., rib bones, button bones, loin bones, and feather bones.
The fact that no bone crushing, grinding, or pulverizing occurs limits the types of bones that are used. The bones must
be hard enough to emerge from the process essentially intact and in natural physical conformation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the traditional mechanical deboning process, described in the 1982 final regulations on MS(S) (47 FR 28214), it
is possible to use whole carcasses; however, generally, the raw materials for the conventional process are parts
of carcasses from which most of the skeletal muscle already has been removed by traditional hand-deboning methods.
With the mechanical deboning technology described in the regulations on MS(S), these bones are broken up and pushed
under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with
the soft tissue.

FSIS believes that the resulting product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery
systems is comparable to meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, including the use of mechanical knives and that,
as such it warrants classification as ``meat.'' FSIS believes that current relevant Federal meat inspection regulations
on labeling meat should apply, and, as such, the ``meat'' derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and
recovery systems may be described by any term that accurately reflects it as meat. Advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and meat recovery systems apply a process mechanism that shaves, presses or scrapes adhering tissue from
the surface of livestock bones. The machines do not grind, crush, or pulverize bones to separate muscle tissue, and
the bones and the interconnecting soft tissues that link bones emerge from the process in a manner consistent with
hand-deboning operations that use knives.

Meat products derived by advanced meat/bone separation are characterized by identifiable muscle fiber structure,
visible differentiation of lean and fat, and components normally associated with and expected in meat obtained by
hand-deboning. The advanced recovery systems produce distinct whole pieces of skeletal muscle tissue with a well-defined
particulate size similar in consistency to (species) trimmings derived by hand-deboning and used to formulate processed
meat products. The color of the meat derived from these systems is similar to that of (species) trimmings.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 As such, the meat derived from the advanced recovery systems conforms to the definition of ``meat'' because it has
the functional and chemical characteristics of meat; there are no powdered bone or constituents of bone, e.g., bone
marrow, that are not in conformance with the definition and expectation of meat or that which would render the product
adulterated or misbranded under the regulations. It is FSIS's belief that, unlike MS(S), consumer expectations
of ``meat'' are met with regard to the product obtained from the advances in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems, because the product's characteristics, in terms of appearance and texture, and its composition are similar
to those of ``meat,'' as currently defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).

In contrast, MS(S) differs from hand-deboned meat and the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation due to
its highly comminuted, spread-like consistency and its content of varying amounts of bone, including bone marrow,
and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue. MS(S) is amorphous and lacks the characteristic components seen in
meat, e.g., muscle fiber, the presence of connective tissue fibers in the way they occur naturally, and distinct lean
and fat components. These characteristics render the product materially different than meat.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to amend the definition of meat in the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 301.2(rr)) to include
as meat product resulting from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, establish criteria
for meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, and establish requirements for the
handling of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, as well as the material
from which it is derived. FSIS is proposing these amendments to the Federal meat inspection regulations to update
the definition of meat to include as meat product produced from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems. It is FSIS's intent to recognize that (1) substantial advances have occurred with regard to the machinery
for separating skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts of carcasses from livestock bones, since the promulgation
of rules on the production, use, and labeling of MS(S) and the products in which it is used as an ingredient, and that
(2) the characteristics and composition of the meat from these advances are comparable to the product traditionally
defined as ``meat.'' In proposing the amendments, FSIS continues to fulfill its statutory responsibility to prevent
the preparation and distribution in commerce of meat and meat food products which are adulterated or misbranded or
not properly marked, labeled, or packaged.

1. Definition of Meat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would amend the definition of ``meat'' set forth in 9 CFR 301.2(rr) of the Federal meat inspection regulations
to include as meat product, meeting certain criteria, that is derived from the mechanical separation of skeletal
muscle tissue from the bones of livestock by using advanced mechanical meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery
systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, and from which the bones emerge comparable to those resulting
from hand-deboning, i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable
as loin bones, rib bones, etc., when they emerge from the machinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated, FSIS believes that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems has the functional and chemical characteristics of ``meat.'' This product is also comparable to meat derived
by hand-deboning techniques, including mechanical high-speed knives. FSIS further believes that consumer expectations
of ``meat'' are met with regard to the identity of the product, because the product's characteristics, in terms of
appearance and texture, and its composition are similar to those of ``meat,'' as currently defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr).
Therefore, FSIS is proposing to amend the definition of ``meat'' to include meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would establish protein quality and calcium content criteria for meat derived from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and meat recovery systems and assure its compliance with such criteria through a quality control
program in order to assure conformance with consumer expectations of ``meat'' and production of ``meat'' comparable
to that obtained by hand-deboning techniques. A maximum calcium content (as a measure of bone solids) of not more than
0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product (within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg) and a minimum protein quality requirement
of a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent, or an alternative
measure of at least 33 percent essential amino acids of the total amino acids present, would be established for the
product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS has carefully considered whether there is a need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat content(s)
for product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. FSIS believes that such
action is not necessary because protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling
of most multi-ingredient meat and poultry products upon the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations
which is July 6, 1994 (58 FR 632). These regulations also establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient,
raw products, and specify that FSIS will evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant
participation is not found, FSIS shall initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under
the voluntary program. Therefore, with certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the
two nutrients in muscle meat that are the sole source of calories and are characteristic of the nutrient profile of
meat. Such information will ensure that consumers are not misled about the composition of products containing meat
obtained using advanced meat/bone separation machinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exceptions, including products produced by small businesses
and products in individually wrapped packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these
products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed
products purchased by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information
on single-ingredient, raw products, consumers will have information on protein and fat for most products purchased
for consumption at home. Furthermore, FSIS believes that the fat and protein contents of meat derived from advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems would be comparable to the fat and protein contents of meat derived
from hand-deboning. Based on these considerations, FSIS maintains that there is no need to establish minimum protein
and/or maximum fat contents for products derived from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems.

FSIS is proposing to include in the amendment to the definition of ``meat,'' criteria on maximum calcium content (as

and recovery systems is both consistent with consumer expectations of ``meat,'' e.g., beef trimmings, and comparable
to ``meat,'' as traditionally defined, that is used to formulate further processed meat food products. The criteria
is a measure designed to ensure that bones are not crushed, ground, or pulverized during processing. The maximum calcium
content of 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product is supported by data submitted to FSIS for the product derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, based upon analytical repeatability studies conducted by the Agency for calcium, FSIS proposes to
establish a tolerance, i.e., allowance for statistical variability, of 0.03 percent or 30 mg/100 gm for individual
samples.

Protein quality. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems
meet a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement an alternative measurement_the
content of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino acids present. Protein quality
is a measure of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids in food protein and a measure of
the ability of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regulations on MS(S) were published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein
quality was the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source
to support growth in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method
for measuring protein quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human
dietary needs, in its final regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption than the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.

FSIS is proposing to require that the protein in meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems
have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed
as a percent. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score would be required to be determined by methods
given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule. The proposed protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score or not less than 40 expressed as a percent is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements for
protein in foods for children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which
FSIS cross-referenced in its final nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes
this value protects the young consumer from inadequate nutrition from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein
that does not meet the dietary needs for growth) and, in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS also
believes it is appropriate to assure comparability of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation systems
with that derived by hand-deboning to maintain the quality and integrity of the meat supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring
compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is proposing that, for the purpose of measuring the protein
quality of meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an alternative measurement
of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score.
This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of meat'' and ``total amino
acids present in meat,'' i.e., an essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present
in the meat. Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
and valine content, and the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine,
and hydroxyproline content. The essential amino acid content would be required to be determined by methods given
in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Quality Evaluation'' which is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS continues to believe that meat found to be in compliance by the proposed amino acid content measurement would
have protein of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation of an Expert Work Group that
was organized by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with the University of Maryland,
to develop recommendations based on available scientific knowledge for consideration in policy decisions regarding
the protein quality of meat, poultry, and their products.

The public should be aware that FSIS continues to have interest in investigations of protein quality which include
among their objectives the identification of improved methods for determining protein quality. In evaluating the
possible use of alternative approaches to assuring protein quality, FSIS will consider data and other comments submitted
by the public.

Qualify control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FSIS is proposing to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems
be produced under an approved quality control program. FSIS believes quality control is necessary to assure that
establishments manufacture meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that complies
with the provisions of the proposed amendment of the definition of meat. Utilization of such a quality control program
in producing this product would be prerequisite for the approval of labels for products consisting of or containing
meat from advanced recovery systems. In other words, an approved quality control program would be necessary prior
to the production of meat using advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The function of a quality control program would be to restrict potential deviations from the prescribed definition
of meat by controlling the factors that can affect conformance with the definition. Thus, it is proposed to require
that the quality control program provide the controls and information necessary to assure that the meat from advanced
meat/bone separation and recovery systems will meet each of the requirements of the regulations and will enable establishment
personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing on methods that will maintain the uniformity
of starting materials and control the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting product. The methods
of analysis for calcium and protein quality that are permitted and are intended to be used should be identified in the
quality control system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the owner or operator of an establishment that intends to manufacture meat from advanced meat/bone
separation machinery and recovery systems would request the Administrator of FSIS to approve the establishment's
quality control program. The procedures and criteria for receiving such requests and assessing the adequacy of programs
for quality control, as well as for terminating approval, would be those set forth in 9 CFR 318.4. These provisions
provide guidance on the development and maintenance of appropriate quality control programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that with a quality control approach to preventing noncompliance from occurring, the need for testing
the resulting product to assure compliance can be reduced and, consequently, the costs of production kept down. Moreover,
the proposed quality control requirement builds on the control and information programs that processors use to predict
and minimize the likelihood of manufacturing products that are inconsistent and of varying quality, and do not comply
with regulatory requirements. Proposing to rely on a approved quality control program, rather than continual testing
by processors, is a means for assuring that operations achieve compliance with the applicable proposed requirements
and, thereby, prevents misbranding and adulteration of the resulting meat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of preventing misbranding and adulteration are key issues with regard to meat products produced by mechanical
meat/bone separation, and can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control incorporates
appropriate methods and monitoring techniques, and adheres to good manufacturing practices. FSIS believes that
product exceeding the calcium limit should not be classified as meat because if it exceeds the proposed calcium limits,
it would reflect unacceptable incorporation of bone in the product during processing. To ensure that product satisfies
the calcium requirement, FSIS is proposing that a sample of at least one pound from each lot of production would be taken
and analyzed for calcium. A lot would consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and
recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the product produced
from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. The results from chemical analyses
would be compared to the requirement of 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. If statistical
evidence exists that product may not be in compliance, then further sampling of the product will be required to demonstrate
that the product is in compliance with requirements for meat derived from meat/bone separation and recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that statistical evidence of non-compliance exists when an individual analytical result is more than
0.03 percent (i.e., 30 mg) above the requirement, i.e., greater than 0.18 percent (i.e., 180 mg). (This tolerance
is derived by equating it to three times the expected standard deviation (i.e., 0.1 percent) of the analytical procedure
used by FSIS to measure the calcium contents in samples.)

If any single analytical result is more than 0.18 percent, FSIS proposes that, before product from a production lot
that is still at the establishment or one subsequently produced can be considered to be in compliance, at least three
samples
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 from that lot must be taken and analyzed for calcium, either separately or as a composite (i.e., combining the three
samples for analysis), at the option of the establishment. The average of the results or the composite result must
comply with the requirement for calcium (i.e., less than or equal to 0.15 percent). Taking three samples from each
lost would continue until five consecutive lots
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15 percent. Individual results or an average of results would
be rounded to the nearest 0.01 percent based on the precision of the methodology for measuring calcium. If the FSIS
program official detects any results out of compliance, the program official may undertake normal compliance procedures.

FSIS believes that, if the statistical evidence indicates that a production lot is not in compliance with the calcium
requirement, the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet the requirements for MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5. In this situation,
FSIS believes that the process is out of control, and there is the likelihood that too much calcium has been incorporated
in the recovered meat, and, therefore, it should be identified as MS(S).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing that at least one pound of product be sampled each week during production of a lot for conformance
with protein quality criteria. Once three consecutive results from 3 production lots are in compliance with the criteria
on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or essential amino acid content),
sampling of production lots can be reduced to a monthly basis. After 6 months, sampling of production lots can be reduced
to a quarterly basis.

A major concern of FSIS is the assurance that consumers receive the quality of meat they expect in terms of the value
of protein needed to sustain good nutrition. Therefore, FSIS is proposing that product from advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and recovery systems that does not meet the requirements of the criteria for protein quality must be identified
as ``(species) fat'' or ``(species) connective tissue,'' and labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions
in 9 CFR Part 317. Protein quality values less than the proposed criteria are comparable to those associated with ``(species)
fat'' and ``(species) connective tissue.''

Handling requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to specify requirements for the handling of material that is to be processed into meat derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems and for handling such product. FSIS is proposing that
the handling of such material comply with the same provisions as are currently prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18 for handling
material for mechanical processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing
practices. Because meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems consists of particulates
of muscle tissue having more surface area than whole muscle cuts, there is a greater potential for bacterial hazards.
FSIS has, therefore, concluded that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials used
to make the product and for the product itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is proposing to adopt the handling requirements prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18. These requirements would provide
that material to be processed into meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems
be processed within 1 hour from the time it is cut or separated from livestock carcasses or parts of carcasses, except
that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40

lot is not in compliance with the calcium limit, as prescribed in &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter, the lot must
be labeled as MS(S) and meet all of the requirements for MS(S) in &sect;319.5 of this subchapter.

The value 0.18% was derived by multiplying by 3 the expected analytical standard deviation obtained by FSIS laboratories
on the approved chemical procedure for measuring calcium which uses Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as
provided in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International'' (formerly the Association of Official
Analytical Chemists), 15th Ed. (1990).

(2) To verify the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or the essential amino acid content in meat derived
from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an analysis of a sample of at least one pound shall
be performed by the operator of the establishment or his or her agency each week during production of a lot to assure
that product will meet the requirements of &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter. Once three consecutive results
from three production lots are in compliance with the criteria on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent, as reflected in paragraph (a) of this section or an essential
amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present, as reflected in paragraph (b) of this section),
sampling of production lots can be reduced to a monthly basis. After 6 months, sampling of production lots can be reduced
to a quarterly basis. Subsequently, if samples are out of compliance, sampling each week would be repeated until three
consecutive results from three production lots are in compliance. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid
score and the essential amino acid content shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00
in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,''
Rome, 1990. The ``Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation'' as published by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization is incorporated as it exists
on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)
and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the Division of Nutrition, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
(HFF&hyph;260), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204. It is also available for inspection
at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Product resulting from
the separating process which fails to meet the protein quality requirement in &sect;301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter,
shall be labeled as ``(Species) fat'' or ``(Species) connective tissue.''
