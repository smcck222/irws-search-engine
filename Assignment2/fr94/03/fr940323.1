SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the Aurora, Buckley ANGB Airport, Colorado, Class D airspace. This action would amend
the Aurora, Buckley ANGB, Colorado, Class D airspace from full-time to part-time. Airspace reclassification, in
effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone'' for airports with operating control
towers, and ``air traffic area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' This amendment would
bring publications up to date, giving continuous information to the aviation public.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class D airspace
at Aurora, Colorado, to correct an error in the Class D airspace description. During the airspace reclassification
process (57 FR 38962; August 27, 1992) the language designating the Class D airspace as part-time was inadvertently
omitted. This action would correct that error. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has
discontinued the use of the term ``control zone,'' and airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth is now
``Class D airspace.'' The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace
is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_ (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to authorize the assessment of a $30 fee for any defaulted
payment resulting from a check or other monetary instrument returned unpaid by a financial institution, including
Automated Clearinghouse defaulted payments, which were presented for duties, taxes and other charges incurred
in connection with any commercial or noncommercial importation or other Customs transaction whether or not backed
by a Customs bond. At present, Customs authority to assess the $30 fee is limited to returned checks presented with
respect to noncommercial importations for which no formal entry was required, and other Customs transactions not
backed by a Customs bond. The purpose of the proposed change is to enable Customs to recoup the administrative costs
incurred in processing all returned checks and other defaulted payments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as T.D. 92&hyph;73 on August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35458), Customs amended its regulations to establish a $30 charge for each
check that is returned by a financial institution to Customs unpaid, if that check was presented either for payment
of duties or other charges incurred on noncommercial importations for which a formal entry was not required or for
payment in connection with any other transaction not backed by a Customs bond (&sect;24.1(e), Customs Regulations;
19 CFR 24.1(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Customs has not been entirely successful at charging the $30 fee in part because Customs cannot differentiate
in a cost effective manner between returned checks made by individuals on noncommercial importations, and those
made by commercial entities, which are usually backed by a Customs bond. Moreover, because Customs is only authorized
at present to charge the fee in connection with noncommercial importations or other transactions not backed by a Customs
bond, Customs is unable to recoup the administrative costs incurred for processing all returned checks and other
defaulted payments. In particular, &sect;24.1(e) does not authorize charging the fee for processing defaulted
payments made through the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) (see &sect;24.25, Customs Regulations; 19 CFR 24.25).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 24.1(e) was made applicable only to noncommercial importations and other transactions not backed by a Customs
bond, primarily because of the availability of liquidated damages in cases where checks were returned unpaid in connection
with commercial importations and other transactions which were supported by a bond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the assessment of liquidated damages does not recoup the administrative costs connected with processing
defaulted payments. All liquidated damages collected by Customs are credited to one of the Treasury Department's
miscellaneous receipt accounts which cannot be used to defray the expense of processing defaulted payments. The
$30 fee provided for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;24.1(e), on the other hand, is credited to a Customs account whose purpose is specifically to recoup the administrative
costs associated with processing defaulted payments. Thus, because the $30 fee is money usable by Customs in this
regard while liquidated damages are not, the two assessments may not properly be considered a duplicate assessment
for a single defaulted payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, against this backdrop, Customs proposes to amend &sect;24.1(e) so as to permit the application of the
$30 fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all returned checks, other monetary instruments, and ACH defaulted payments, regardless of whether the maker
is commercial and/or bonded.

), for the reasons stated in the preamble, it is certified that the proposed amendment would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is not subject to the regulatory analysis
or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 or 604. Nor would the proposed amendment result in a ``significant regulatory
action'' under E.O. 12866.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 16, 1993, EPA published the proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 20802). The period for receiving public comments on the proposal closed on September 13, 1993. Subsequently,
EPA announced the availability of three additional reports that EPA is considering as it develops the final Guidance
(August 9, 1993, 58 FR 42266; September 13, 1993, 58 FR 47845). The period for receiving comments on issues raised in
the three reports closed on October 13, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the April 16, 1993, proposal described EPA's intent to hold an open public meeting to provide an opportunity
to members of the public who wish to express views on the written comments of other parties submitted during the public
comment period (58 FR 20823). This meeting will be held on April 26, 1994, at the time and address shown above. Interested
parties are welcome to attend the meeting to present their views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received in the public hearing held August 4 and 5, 1993, and all written comments received during the
public comment periods that closed September 13, 1993, and October 13, 1993, will be considered by the Agency in the
final rulemaking. The April 26, 1994, meeting is intended to provide an opportunity for those parties who wish to comment
on issues raised by other commenters contained in the public docket for the rulemaking. Therefore, interested parties
who provided comments on the proposal should not, and do not need to, restate their views at the April 26, 1994, meeting.
The public meeting may also include separate concurrent sessions on the elements of the proposed Guidance in order
to facilitate the anticipated number of commenters and issues. For further information on the meeting, you may contact
the persons identified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also invites elected officials and other representatives of State, local, and Tribal governments to attend the
meeting. EPA encourages such participation, in accordance with Executive Order 12875, Enhancing the Intergovernmental
Partnership, issued October 26, 1993 (58 FR 58093).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summaries of meetings with EPA that have been held at the request of the Great Lakes States and other parties since the
publication of the proposal have been placed in the docket and are available from the address listed above. EPA will
place a summary of the open public meeting in the public docket at the address listed above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is given that the Administrator of EPA has forwarded to the Secretary of Agriculture a final rule under section
5 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The rule is an amendment to the experimental
use permit (EUP) regulations for pesticides that was proposed on January 22, 1993. These regulations clarify the
circumstances under which an EUP is presumed not to be required and implement a screening procedure that requires
notification to EPA before initiation of small-scale testing of certain microbial pesticides. This action is required
by FIFRA section 25(a)(2).

children; clarify eligibility of homeless individuals; provide for the continuous eligibility of pregnant women
without regard to changes in income; provide for ambulatory prenatal care for certain pregnant women during a limited
period of presumptive eligibility, based on income eligibility only; and tie the medical assistance program to the
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payment levels in the State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act), generally States with Medicaid programs are required to provide
Medicaid eligibility to individuals, children, and families who are receiving, or are deemed to be receiving, cash
assistance under the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) program, the supplemental security income (SSI)
program, and the mandatory State supplement program; and to certain other needy pregnant women and children (referred
to as the mandatory categorically needy eligibility groups). At State option, States may provide Medicaid to individuals
who meet the categorical and financial requirements for the cash assistance programs but, for various reasons, are
not receiving such assistance_for example, individuals who are in institutions or have not applied for cash assistance
benefits_and to certain other specified needy groups (referred to as the optional categorically needy eligibility
groups).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to categorically needy groups, States, at their option, may provide Medicaid to individuals who would
be eligible for the cash assistance programs except that they have income or resources above allowable levels (referred
to as the medically needy eligibility group). The medically needy are permitted to reduce their income to the allowed
level by deducting (spending down) incurred medical expenses to become eligible for Medicaid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, a number of statutes have been enacted that established new eligibility groups, revised existing
eligibility groups, or expanded services to certain low-income individuals. On October 21, 1986, Congress passed
provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99&hyph;509, that amended the
Social Security Act to expand the Medicaid eligibility groups. States were given the option of providing Medicaid
to certain needy individuals who had incomes up to a certain specified percentage of Federal poverty income guidelines
and who previously were not eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy. These individuals included pregnant women,
infants, and children (section 9401) and aged and disabled individuals (section 9402). In addition, section 9407
allowed States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period on
the basis of income eligibility only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '86 also clarified Medicaid eligibility of homeless individuals who are residents of a State, regardless of
whether or not they maintain a home at a fixed address or maintain it permanently (section 9405). In addition, section
11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act (title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law 99&hyph;570),
enacted on October 27, 1986, requires that a State Medicaid plan provide for a method of making medical services eligibility
cards available to Medicaid-eligible individuals who do not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, enacted on December 22, 1987,
made further changes in the Social Security Act to expand the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant
women, infants, and children and the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children under a certain age. OBRA
'87 also allowed a State to impose a monthly premium on optional categorically needy pregnant women and infants with
incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. In addition, section 4105 of OBRA '87 clarified Medicaid
coverage of clinic services furnished outside of clinic facilities to homeless individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360, enacted on July 1, 1988, also further
amended provisions relating to the eligibility groups of individuals with incomes related to the Federal poverty
income level. MCCA made some of the low-income pregnant women and infants mandatory Medicaid eligibility groups
(those at or below 75 percent of the poverty level and then, a year later, 100 percent of the poverty level) and amended
the eligibility criteria for others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), Public Law 100&hyph;485, enacted on October 13, 1988, made several technical
corrections to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. These corrections related to the description
of the eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101&hyph;239, enacted on December 19, 1989,
changed the mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants by increasing the income criteria
to at or below 133 percent (instead of at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level; and added a new mandatory
group of low-income children who are age one but have not attained age 6 who have incomes at or below 133 percent of the
Federal poverty level. OBRA '89 mandated a percentage greater than 133 percent of the Federal poverty level for the
pregnant women and infants groups if the State had such a greater percentage in its State plan (whether approved or
not) as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89, or established under State authorizing legislation or State appropriations
as of December 19, 1989, when it covered these pregnant women or infants, or both, as optional categorically needy
groups. Low-income children who are age 6 but have not attained age 7, or at State option, age 8 with incomes at or below
100 percent of the Federal poverty level remained an optional categorically needy group. These provisions were effective
on April 1, 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted on November 5, 1990, made
additional changes to both the mandatory and optional groups of pregnant women, infants, and children. OBRA '90 created
a new group of mandatory categorically needy children who are at least age 6 but have not yet reached age 19. These are
children born after September 30, 1983 with family income at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA
'90 made corresponding changes to the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children to include children born
after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 and to allow States to use an earlier date of birth in order to include
older children sooner than is mandated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OBRA '90 mandated that a State provide continuous eligibility to pregnant women throughout the pregnancy
and postpartum period without regard to changes in income. (This had been a State option.) OBRA '90 also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed the requirement for newborns who are deemed to be eligible as a result of their mothers' eligibility status.
Previously, a newborn was considered eligible at birth if the newborn's mother was eligible for and receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid. The newborn could remain eligible for as long as a year if the mother remained eligible and the infant was
a member of the mother's household. With the OBRA '90 change, a newborn may still remain eligible for as long as a year
if the mother loses eligibility but would remain eligible if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she were pregnant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OBRA '90 made several changes to presumptive eligibility for pregnant women by eliminating the existing
time limit on the presumptive period and allowing a pregnant woman to remain presumptively eligible until the State
makes a determination on her regular application for Medicaid or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if she does not file a regular application, the last day of the month following the month in which she was determined
presumptively eligible. OBRA '90 also provided that the application given to a presumptively eligible pregnant
woman could be the application used by the State to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular Medicaid eligibility of low-income pregnant women under section 1902(1)(1)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document proposes to incorporate provisions of OBRA '86, '87, '89, and '90, the Homeless Eligibility Clarification
Act, MCCA, and FSA in the Medicaid regulations, as outlined and discussed in the following section of this document.
(Additional related provisions in these laws are being addressed in separate rulemaking documents.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9401 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) and 1902(1)
to establish optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and women during the 60-day period beginning
on the last day of pregnancy, infants, and children up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age 5 whose income does not exceed a State-established standard that is a specified percentage of the Federal nonfarm
poverty income guidelines. Under OBRA '86, a State could establish this income standard at a level at or below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. A State had to cover both pregnant women and infants (it could not cover
either group separately) and it had to cover both of these groups in order to cover children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '86 also amended section 1902(e) to provide that States that have chosen to cover infants and children under section
1902(1) must continue to cover those infants and children under certain circumstances. Under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(e)(7), if the infants and children are receiving covered inpatient services at the time they reach the age limits
under the State plan, the State must cover them until the end of their inpatient stay if they remain otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible. Also, OBRA '86 specifically exempted the group of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX)
from the limits on family income which affect a State's Federal financial participation (FFP) under section 1903(f)(4)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Later legislation changed the age limit for children and the percentage of the poverty level for the income standard.
Specifically, section 4101(c) of OBRA '87 raised the maximum age for low-income children from age 5 up to age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 4101(a)(1) of OBRA '87 increased the percentage of the poverty guidelines at which the income standard
could be set to 185 percent for pregnant women and infants under age 1, effective July 1, 1988. However, for children
age 1 up to age 8, section 4101 retained the percentage level at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines (or, if the State had chosen to cover pregnant women and infants
with a percentage of income below 100 percent, the percentage for children had to equal the percentage used for the
pregnant women and infants). Section 4118 of OBRA '87 also removed the reference to ``nonfarm'' in the description
of the Federal poverty income guidelines to be used. In addition, section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 amended section 1916
of the Act to allow States to charge a premium to optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups of low-income pregnant women and infants who have family incomes above a specified level.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 302 of MCCA added section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) to the Social Security Act, which required States to provide
mandatory eligibility to groups of pregnant women and infants up to one year of age with incomes at or below 75 percent
of the Federal poverty income guidelines, effective July 1, 1989. Those States that, as of enactment of MCCA, offered
eligibility to pregnant women and infants with incomes at 100 percent of the poverty level (or at some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower income threshold between 75 percent and 100 percent) were required to continue eligibility at this level. A
State had to provide an income level that reflected at least the percentage of poverty specified in an amendment to
its State plan to cover these groups (whether the amendment had been approved or not). Even if there was no percentage
specified in the State plan, the maintenance of eligibility requirement also applied to percentages established
under a State's authorizing legislation or provided for under the State's appropriations in order to provide Medicaid
to these individuals before July 1, 1989. MCCA also provided that, effective July 1, 1990, mandatory eligibility
was required for groups of pregnant women and infants under age one with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal
poverty income guidelines. In addition to creating mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants, the MCCA eliminated
the requirement in section 1902(1)(4) that States cover both pregnant women and infants in order to cover either group
and to cover both groups in order to cover children. We have interpreted this MCCA amendment to allow States to cover
optional groups of pregnant women and infants separately and with different income levels. Coverage of groups of
pregnant women or infants, or both, with incomes above the mandatory percentages (75 percent, effective July 1, 1989,
and 100 percent, effective July 1, 1990) but at or below 185 percent of the poverty level and children age 1 year to age
8 years with incomes at or below 100 percent of the poverty level remained optional under the MCCA provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MCCA also amended section 1902(e)(7) to provide continued coverage to all of the revised groups of children under
section 1902(1) until the end of their inpatient stays. It also amended section 1903(f)(4) to exempt from the FFP income
limits all of the redefined mandatory and optional groups in section 1902(1) and specifically made the use of less
restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2) apply to several groups, including the
mandatory groups of women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), and to all optional categorically needy
groups, including the optional group of women, infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes made by section 302 of MCCA applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning
on or after July 1, 1989, with respect to eligibility on or after that date. The effective date applied whether or not
we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances,
request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6401 of OBRA '89 revised the provisions under MCCA by further amending the eligibility groups of low-income
pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 8. First, section 6401 changed the income criteria for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants up to age 1 under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV)
of the Act by increasing the income level criteria from no less than 100 percent of the Federal poverty income level
to no less than 133 percent of the Federal poverty income level, effective April 1, 1990. The law mandates that a State
use a percentage greater than 133 percent (but no greater than 185 percent) of the Federal poverty income level if the
State had such a higher percentage for optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically needy groups of pregnant women and infants as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89 in its State plan (whether
approved or not) or established by State authorizing legislation or State appropriations. Second, OBRA '89 established
under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) of the Act a new mandatory eligibility group of low-income children age 1 up
to age 6. The State was required to establish an income level for this group that equaled 133 percent of the Federal poverty
income level. States could continue to cover as optional categorically needy other low-income children age 6 up to
age 7 or, at State option, up to age 8 who are born after September 30, 1983. The income level for this group of children
age 6 up to age 8 would continue to be established at a level not to exceed 100 percent of the Federal poverty income level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6401 of OBRA '89 also made conforming changes to section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) (excluding the mandatory
group of children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) from the group of optional categorically needy), other parts
of section 1902(1) (changed the descriptions of low-income groups of pregnant women, infants, and children), section
1902(e)(7) (added the new group of mandatory children to the continuation of inpatient hospital services for infants
and children who have reached the maximum age for eligibility), section 1902(r)(2) (made the use of less restrictive
income and resource methodologies than cash assistance methodologies apply to the new group of mandatory children),
and section 1903(f)(4) (exempted the new group of mandatory children from the limitations on Medicaid payments).
In addition, section 6411(i)(3) of OBRA '89 amended section 1925 (a)(3)(C) and (b)(3)(C)(i) to require States to
determine if children who would cease to receive extended Medicaid under section 1925 may be eligible for Medicaid
under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) (IV) or (VI) or 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) before terminating eligibility based
on section 1925. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes made by section 6401 applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or
after April 1, 1990, with respect to eligibility on or after that date. The effective date applied whether or not we
had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances,
request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation. Section 6411(i)(3) was effective as if
enacted as part of the Family Support Act of 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4601 of OBRA '90 established a new mandatory group of low-income children under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII)
of the Act. This group described in 1902(l)(1)(D) of the Act includes children born after September 30, 1983 who have
attained age 6 but have not attained age 19. The State must establish an income standard for this group of children which
equals 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. Section 4601 made conforming changes to section 1905(n)(2) of the
Act which defines qualified children. Children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 are now included
in the mandatory group of qualified children. In addition, States have the option to choose an earlier date of birth
if they wish to phase in this group more quickly. Section 4601 made additional conforming changes to (1) section 1902(r)(2)
to allow States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those used under the cash assistance
programs in determining financial eligibility of the new group under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII); (2) section
1903(f)(4) of the Act to exempt the new group of mandatory children from the limitations on Medicaid payments; and
(3) section 1925 of the Act to require that States determine whether a child is eligible under this new mandatory group
before terminating eligibility based on section 1925. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes made by section 4601 applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or
after July 1, 1991. The effective date applied whether or not we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions
by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances, request a delayed implementation date in order
to enact State legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(l) of the Act, as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101 of OBRA '87, section 302 of
MCCA, section 608(d)(15) of FSA, section 6401 of OBRA '89, and section 4601 of OBRA '90, specifies the eligibility
conditions for the mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), the mandatory
group of children age 1 up to age 6 under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), the mandatory group of children age 6 up to
age 19 under section 1902 (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), and the optional categorically needy groups of pregnant women and
infants under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility of individuals who fall into one of the mandatory and optional groups of low-income pregnant women, infants,
and children is based on these individuals meeting State-established income standards. States must establish their
income standards at a level that does not exceed the specified percentage of the Federal poverty income guidelines
for a family equal to the size of the family, including the woman, infant, or child. Because the official poverty guidelines
are revised annually to adjust for inflation, States will be automatically increasing the income standards established
to keep pace with inflation as a result of the changes in the poverty guidelines. (HHS determines official Federal
poverty income guidelines and issues them in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 annually, usually during the month of February. See, for example, 58 FR 8287, February 12, 1993.) For optional groups
of pregnant women and infants, the agency may establish separate income standards or use a single standard.

Under section 1902(l)(3)(E), as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(e)(3) of OBRA '87, in determining whether
the income of members of the low-income groups of pregnant women, infants, and children meets the established income
standards, States must use the same methodologies as applied in determining financial eligibility for AFDC, or for
title IV&hyph;E as appropriate, except to the extent that the methodologies are inconsistent with section 1902(a)(17)(D)
of the Act. Section 4101(e)(3) of OBRA '87 clarified that, in determining family income, States must not use any AFDC
methodologies (such as stepparent, grandparent, or sibling deeming) that are inconsistent with the deeming policies
specific to Medicaid under section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act (H. Rep. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 446 (1987)). Section
1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act provides, in part, that in determining financial responsibility of relatives, only the
income of spouses may be considered as available to spouses, and only the income of parents may be considered as available
to a child until the child is 21, unless the child is blind or disabled. The methodologies include, but are not limited
to, those used for disregarding income. States also are not permitted to allow individuals whose eligibility is determined
based on membership in these low-income groups to spend down; that is, the State may not deduct the costs of incurred
medical expenses or any other type of remedial care from income, in determining whether an individual's income meets
the income standard established by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for determining financial eligibility of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children were
also affected by section 303(e) of MCCA. Section 303(e) established a new section 1902(r)(2) to permit States, at
their option, to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those used under the cash assistance
programs (e.g., AFDC or SSI), in determining financial eligibility for a number of groups, including the mandatory
groups of pregnant women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and the optional groups of pregnant women,
infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). Section 6401 of OBRA '89 specifically made section 1902(r)(2)
applicable to the mandatory group of low-income children age 1 up to age 6 in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI). Section
4601 of OBRA '90 specifically made section 1902(r)(2) applicable to the mandatory group of low-income children age
6 up to age 19 in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the specific preclusion of a spenddown in section 1902(l) was not modified by section 1902(r)(2).
However, States may use other more liberal methodologies to the extent that they are consistent with section 1902(r)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(l)(1) of the Act specifically states that the income standards established by the State must correlate
to a family size that includes the woman, infant, or child. The statute does not specifically address whether the pregnant
woman's unborn child must be counted in determining family size. However, the legislative history supports counting
the pregnant woman as if her child were born and living with her. The language of the 1986 House Committee Report that
addressed the section 1902(l)(1) provision states that ``in determining a pregnant woman's family income level,
the Committee intends that a State would treat the woman as if her child were born and living with her at the time she applied
for assistance. Thus, a single woman would be treated as a family of two, a pregnant woman living with a spouse or child
as a family of three, and so forth *&blank;*&blank;*'' (H. Rep. No. 727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 100 (1986)). The House
bill that accompanied this report states that the family size should be equal to ``the family including the woman or
child.'' Even though the language is not specific in section 1902(l)(1), we believe the legislative history reveals
that Congress intended that the unborn child be included under this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to specify in these proposed regulations that the family size includes the ``unborn child and other members
of the Medicaid budgetary unit.'' Policies relating to the Medicaid budgetary unit were addressed in a final rule
with comment period published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4908), and are, therefore, not being addressed in this preamble. The effective date of the
January 1993 rule has been delayed (58 FR 9120, February 19, 1993; 58 FR 44457, August 23, 1993; and 59 FR 8138, February
18, 1994). We will conform the policies on the Medicaid budgetary unit contained in these proposed regulations with
whatever policy is in effect at the time that we issue these proposed regulations as final.

2. Resource Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allows States, at their option, to apply a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource standard to the low-income eligibility groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act. Section 9401 of OBRA '86 establishes a floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the resource standard that is a specific and objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. If a State chooses to apply a resource standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard may be no more restrictive than that applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under SSI for pregnant women, and than that applied under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFDC, for infants and children. (If Guam, Puerto Rico, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Virgin Islands elect to apply a resource standard, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for pregnant women may be no more restrictive than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that applied under SSI under section 1613 of the Act. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is because the reference to the resource standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women in the statute is to the standard that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied under title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that is applied under the State plan program under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title XVI.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments regarding the different treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income and resources for the mandatory and optional groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require or permit this different treatment to be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Medicaid eligibility groups under the comparability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act.

3. Applicability for States With Section 1115 Waivers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Territories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 302(c) of MCCA struck the original section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(1)(4)(A) of the Act and section 302(d) of MCCA added a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new section 1902(1)(4)(A). Under the new section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(1)(4)(A), as amended by section 6401 of OBRA '89 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4601 of OBRA '90, States that are providing Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide mandatory categorically needy eligibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women and infants under age 1 with incomes at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below 133 percent of the poverty level under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), children age 1 but under age 6 with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) and children who have attained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age 6 but are under age 19 with incomes at or below 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the poverty level under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) in the same manner as other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States operating under a waiver granted under section 1115 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act must (as all other States must) cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory groups at higher levels if they have already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chosen to use those higher levels. However, Guam, Puerto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mariana Islands retain the option of providing Medicaid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the otherwise mandatory groups of low-income pregnant women, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants, and children. The Territories may establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate or identical income standards for pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and infants at any percentage of the poverty level at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below 185 percent. However, if a Territory chooses to cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children from age 1 up to age 6, it must cover all such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level. Also, if a Territory chooses to cover children born 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 30, 1983 who have attained age 6 but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under age 19, it must cover all such children with incomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at or below 100 percent of the poverty level.

4. Comparability of Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act, as amended by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9401 of OBRA '86, section 4101 of OBRA '87, and section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
302(a)(1)(C) of MCCA, contains an exemption to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparability of services requirements at section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(B) for services furnished to pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the Act who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible as mandatory or optional categorically needy under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). The amended provision (under clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VII) following what is currently paragraph (F) of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)) provides that the services that are available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pregnant women under the section 1902(l) low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups are limited to services relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, family planning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and postpartum services) and to other conditions that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicate pregnancy. (Section 4101(e)(1) of OBRA '87 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded services related to pregnancy to include ``family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(COBRA), Public Law 99&hyph;272, enacted an earlier comparability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of services requirement for all pregnant women covered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State plan. This requirement appears under clause (V) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following what is currently paragraph (F) of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10). This provision states that if a State makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available ``services relating to pregnancy (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services) or to any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition which may complicate pregnancy,'' the State is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to provide these services to any other individual, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except pregnant women, covered under the plan. The State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide its pregnancy-related services and services for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other condition that may complicate pregnancy, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same amount, duration, and scope, to all pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered under the State plan, including pregnant women whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy is not the basis for their Medicaid eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., those receiving AFDC or SSI). (See &sect;&sect;440.210 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
440.220).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We issued a separate document to interpret this and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions of COBRA. In it, we left to the States the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for defining these services listed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute within the bounds of broad policy guidelines (54 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7798, February 23, 1989 and 55 FR 48601, November 21, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the same principles apply for the pregnancy-related services and services which may complicate pregnancy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are specific to the section 1902(1) group of women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See &sect;440.250(q).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the State plan includes services identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 1905(a) (1) through (24) of the Act (mandatory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional services that are considered as medical assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Medicaid recipients). Many of these services can qualify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate components of the areas of care required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute; that is, prenatal services, delivery services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postpartum services, and family planning services, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services related to conditions that may complicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy. For example, physicians' services in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1905(a)(5) can qualify as prenatal services, since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations by a physician are part of prenatal care, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as delivery services, since a physician may also deliver the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
woman's baby. Therefore, a State plan must provide pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women with what the State has decided are enough services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in section 1905(a) to sufficiently cover each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required areas of care. In addition, a State, at its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option, may provide services under section 1905(a) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (for example, rehabilitative services or nutritional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements) only to pregnant women and not to any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically needy eligible Medicaid recipient, as long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such services qualify as either services related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy or to other conditions that may complicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy. A State would not be required to specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify which services it provides to pregnant women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the State would be required to specify in its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it covers each of the required areas of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We interpret ``pregnancy-related services'' to mean those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services which are needed because the woman is or was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant, either because they are necessary for the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the pregnant woman or fetus or because the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
became necessary as a result of the woman having been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant. These include, but are not limited to, prenatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care, delivery, family planning, and postpartum services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, ``services relating to any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition which may complicate pregnancy'' are not ``pregnancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related'' because they do not arise because of the pregnancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These services include those for diagnosis or treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses or medical conditions which might threaten the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carrying of the fetus to full term or the safe delivery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fetus. Because these services are for conditions ``which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may complicate the pregnancy,'' the services can be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only while the woman is pregnant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that, unlike the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups of pregnant women who are entitled to at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least the full range of services available under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular State's Medicaid plan to recipients of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility group, these low-income categorically needy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women are only entitled to pregnancy-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services (including family planning services) and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the treatment of conditions that may complicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infants and children in these eligibility groups are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for all appropriate Medicaid services included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approved State plan.

5. Premiums for Pregnant Women and Infants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 redesignated section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1916(c) as 1916(d) and created a new section 1916(c) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits States to impose a monthly premium on optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically needy low-income pregnant women and infants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may impose the premium on these individuals if their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income equals or exceeds 150 percent, but is not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
185 percent, of the poverty level for a family of the size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved. The amount of the premium imposed may not exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent of the amount by which the family's income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds 150 percent of the poverty income guidelines. Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the care of a dependent child must be deducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the family's income under this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are prohibited from requiring the prepayment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium. Eligibility may not be terminated for failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay this premium unless the premium has been unpaid for at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 60 days. In cases of undue hardship, as defined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State, the State may waive the payment of the premium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a State may use State or local funds from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs to pay the premium. Under section 1916(c)(4) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, if these funds are used, they may not be counted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income to the individual for whom payment is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Congress did not specifically address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of the term ``costs of care for a dependent child'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Conference Report refers to these costs as ``child care'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses (H. Rep. No. 495, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 731 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1987)), we believe that there was no Congressional intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use a broader concept of child care costs for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision than that traditionally used under the AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Therefore, we propose to define child care costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of this provision as costs related to the care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a child necessary to enable a member of the family whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income was included in the eligibility determination to work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or participate in training.

6. Payment Levels Under AFDC 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OBRA '86 added section 1902(1)(4)(A) to the Act, which provided that a State plan may not elect to cover the optional
groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 5 described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX)
unless the State had in effect AFDC payment levels that were not less than those in effect on April 17, 1986. This provision
became effective on April 1, 1987. OBRA '87 amended this provision, changing the date upon which AFDC levels would
be measured from April 1 to July 1, 1987. The OBRA '87 amendment was effective on December 22, 1987.

Section 302(c) of MCCA eliminated section 1902(1)(4), but placed a comparable provision in a new section 1903(i)(9).
This provision states that payment will not be made to a State with respect to amounts for medical assistance for section
1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) optional groups if the State has in effect AFDC payment levels that are less than those in
effect on July 1, 1987. In addition, section 302(c) established a new, more general maintenance of effort provision
in section 1902(c)(1), which states that the Secretary will not approve any Medicaid State plan if the State has in
effect AFDC payment levels which are less than those in effect on May 1, 1988. Because section 1116(b) of the Act distinguishes
between plans and plan amendments, we interpret this provision literally as prohibiting approval of new State plans
but not prohibiting approval of amendments to a State plan. The MCCA provisions were effective on July 1, 1989. There
have been some questions raised about how we would determine if the AFDC payment level has been maintained by a State
as specified in the law. ``Payment level'' is not an existing term used under AFDC. However, for the purposes of sections
1902(c) and 1903(i)(9), payment levels are the amounts of the payments for basic needs (according to family size)
which would be made to families with no income under the approved State AFDC plan. Special needs are not included, as
we have concluded, based on a review of statutory history, that Congress intended to include only basic needs. Thus,
we propose to find a State has not reduced its payment level if it has not reduced the amount of the AFDC payment for basic
needs made to a family with no other income.

7. Application for AFDC 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4104(e) of OBRA '87 amended section 1902(1)(4) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (C) to specify that a State
Medicaid plan may not provide that any of the low-income pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1)
must apply for AFDC as a condition of applying for or receiving Medicaid. Section 302(c) of MCCA made further amendments
by removing section 1902(1)(4) and adding a comparable provision to section 1902(c)(2) of the Act. Section 1902(c)(2)
provides that the Secretary must not approve any State plan for Medicaid if the State requires low-income pregnant
women, infants, and children under section 1902(1)(1) to apply for AFDC benefits as a condition of applying for or
receiving Medicaid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory amendments discussed above are effective without regard to whether final regulations to carry them
out have been published by the applicable effective dates. However, changes in the Medicaid regulations are necessary
to bring the regulations up to date with current statutory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add a new &sect;435.118 to specify the mandatory eligibility groups of pregnant women, infants under age 1,
children age 1 up to age 6 with incomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines, and children
age 6 up to age 19 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add &sect;435.228 to specify the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants (and
low-income children in American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands) and &sect;436.226 to specify the optional
eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children and the conditions under which they may establish
eligibility.

optional groups of low-income pregnant women and infants

Under section 1902(e)(6) of the Act, as added by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 9401(d) of OBRA '86 and amended by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4101(e)(2) of OBRA '87, section 302(e) of MCCA, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4603 of OBRA '90, States must treat any pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women who are eligible under section 1902(a)(10) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously eligible throughout the pregnancy and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postpartum period without regard to changes in income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9401(d) of OBRA '86 added section 1902(e)(6) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. Section 1902(e)(6) allowed States to treat any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women who were described in sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1902(1) as continuously eligible during the pregnancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and through a 60-day postpartum period, without regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any changes in family income. Women covered under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision consisted of two groups: low-income pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women and low-income women during the 60-day period after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pregnancy ends. Therefore, this provision covered women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who applied for and became Medicaid eligible under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(l) either before or after giving birth. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4101(e)(2) of OBRA '87 redefined the section 1902(e)(6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postpartum period to specify that the period of continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage extends for 60 days after the pregnancy ends, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning on the last day of pregnancy, plus any remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days in the month in which the 60th day occurs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining days in the month provision was added by OBRA '87 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Federal matching payment and quality control purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, in some States, Medicaid eligibility is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated at any time other than the end of the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 302(e) of MCCA amended section 1902(e)(6) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act to provide States with the option of treating any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant woman who has established eligibility under any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility group listed in section 1902(a)(10) and who, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of a change in income, would cease to be eligible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a mandatory eligible low-income pregnant woman throughout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pregnancy and for the specified postpartum period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without regard to changes in family income. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(e)(6) now refers to ``pregnant women'' rather than ``women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 1902(l)(1).'' As a result, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it still covers the pregnant women described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(l)(1)(A) but no longer includes those women in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(l)(1)(A) who first become eligible only in the 60-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postpartum period after they have ceased to be ``pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4603(a)(2) of OBRA '90 further amended section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(e)(6) to require States to provide continuous coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any pregnant woman eligible under section 1902(a)(10) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act who would otherwise lose her eligibility due to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in income. The pregnant woman must be ``deemed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be'' a mandatory categorically needy individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described under sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(1)(1)(A) through the end of the postpartum period. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '90 amendment also stated that this mandatory coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not apply in the case of a woman who has received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambulatory prenatal care under section 1920 of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a presumptive eligibility period and is then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be ineligible for regular Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 1902(e)(6) purports to cover all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women who, because of a change in family income, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not otherwise continue to be eligible for Medicaid, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that it does not automatically cover all pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women who must meet a spenddown. Most pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking to meet a spenddown would be attempting to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility as medically needy. Section 1902(e)(6) now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that a State deem a pregnant woman (who has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established eligibility under any eligibility group) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be a pregnant woman under sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(1)(1)(A) if that woman would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise cease to be eligible due to a change in income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A medically needy woman can establish her eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a given budget period by spending down her excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income. However, if she has the excess income in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following budget period and is ineligible because she cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spend it down, we do not believe that her ineligibility has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted from a ``change'' in income. In fact, her income is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unchanged for eligibility purposes if it remains in excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the medically needy income level by the same amount as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous budget period; she has simply not been able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spend down to the medically needy income level. We believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that under the statute, a medically needy pregnant woman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose family income does not change and who cannot meet her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spenddown does not qualify as having the ``change'' in income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplated by section 1902(e)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are uncertain how to apply section 1902(e)(6) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of pregnant women who have a spenddown, and whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family incomes increase, causing this spenddown amount to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase. We propose to cover under this provision any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant woman who was eligible (either as categorically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needy, medically needy without a spenddown, or medically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needy after meeting a spenddown) at any time during her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy, who then experiences a change in family income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which either would cause her to lose categorically needy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid, medically needy Medicaid without a spenddown, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to lose eligibility (be unable to meet the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spenddown although she would have met the earlier spenddown) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by virtue of an increased spenddown amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would interpret section 1902(e)(6) so that it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not relieve pregnant women who qualify under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(e)(6) of their obligation to satisfy their original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spenddown amount in each budget period while in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(e)(6) status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a pregnant woman who has in the previous budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period met a spenddown has an increase in income and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifies under section 1902(e)(6), she must be ``deemed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be'' a pregnant woman under sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(1)(1)(A). These provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe categorically needy eligibility groups with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to whom the limited Medicaid benefit is available. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that the phrase ``deemed to continue to be'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambiguous. The phrase can mean that the woman is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarded for all purposes as if she were actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically needy, or only that she is to be considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically needy for the purpose of receiving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted service package that applies to pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 1902(1) without regard to the change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her family's income. If we were to regard the woman as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though she were actually categorically needy, she would no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer have to meet any spenddown, and any subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes of income would not affect her eligibility. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would place the medically needy pregnant woman whose income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has increased in a better position than any other medically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needy pregnant woman with a spenddown who has had no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid the anomalous result of only pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women with higher incomes being relieved of their total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spenddown obligations, we propose not to interpret section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(e)(6) as requiring that a medically needy woman be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as though she were categorically needy for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. We propose instead to interpret the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``deemed to continue to be'' in section 1902(e)(6) to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only that a woman who meets her original spenddown amount, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but cannot meet the increased amount, be deemed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for the limited service package provided to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1902(1) pregnant women. The woman can maintain this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed status without having to pay any increased spenddown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts which result from increases in family income. She 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will, however, be required to continue to meet her original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spenddown while in section 1902(e)(6) status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to revise redesignated &sect;435.918 relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redetermination of eligibility, to provide that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must consider a pregnant woman eligible under any Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility group as an individual who is eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive the services available to the mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically needy low-income group throughout the

1. OBRA '90 Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4603(a) of OBRA '90 changed the requirements in section 1902(e)(4) of the Act under which a newborn child remains
eligible for Medicaid, effective January 1, 1991. Prior to this change, States were only required to continue the
eligibility of an infant deemed eligible at birth for so long as the infant remained a member of the mother's household
and the mother remained eligible for Medicaid. States must now also continue the eligibility of an infant deemed eligible
at birth if the infant remains a member of the mother's household and the mother loses Medicaid eligibility but would
remain eligible if pregnant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We considered whether the language ``remain eligible if pregnant'' meant that the mother should be considered as
newly pregnant in each month after the postpartum period. Under this interpretation, if the mother was regarded as
reapplying for Medicaid after the postpartum period as though she were newly pregnant, her income might be too high
for her to be eligible, even under the pregnancy-related eligibility categories. (For example, the mother's income
may have increased above the applicable standard during the pregnancy but she remained eligible through the postpartum
period by virtue of section 1902(e)(6) of the Act.) If she is regarded as newly pregnant, she would not receive the continued
coverage under section 1902(e)(6) for women whose incomes increase after they are already eligible and pregnant.
As a result, the mother would not be ``eligible'' even if she were considered to be pregnant and the infant would lose
eligibility under section 1902(e)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We decided that a better reading of the provision would be to consider a mother as if she had not yet given birth; that
is, as if she had remained continuously pregnant. A discussion of this provision in the House Report of the Committee
on Budget to accompany H.R. 5835 (H. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d. Sess. 103 (1990)) refers to the woman remaining eligible
for Medicaid or one who ``would be eligible for Medicaid were she still pregnant,'' which implies she should be treated
as if she had not given birth. Therefore, we propose to require States to continue the eligibility of an infant deemed
eligible at birth who is in his or her mother's household and whose mother would still be eligible for Medicaid if the
infant had not yet been born. Under this interpretation, changes in the mother's income will have no impact on the infant's
eligibility because were the mother still pregnant, she would remain eligible without regard to changes in income
by virtue of section 1902(e)(6) of the Act. A redetermination of the mother's eligibility is not required at the end
of the postpartum period unless information is received that there has been a change in the mother's circumstances
which might have affected her eligibility even if she were still pregnant and the infant had not yet been born.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An infant must continue to be a member of his/her mother's household to maintain deemed newborn eligibility. We are
codifying existing policy related to determinations of whether an infant is a member of his or her mother's household.
An infant is considered a member of his or her mother's household as long as he or she is continuously hospitalized after
birth, unless the mother has legally relinquished control of the child or the State has established that she has abandoned
the child. After the infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not involving hospitalization, States
must apply the AFDC rules for determining whether a child is living with a specified relative to determine if an infant
(who is not an SSI recipient) is a member of his or her mother's household.

E. Inpatient Services to Infants and Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1902(e)(7) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(b) of OBRA '87, section 302(e)(2)
of MCCA, and section 6401 of OBRA '89, States must extend Medicaid eligibility to a low-income infant or child described
in section 1902(l) of the Act or a qualified child described in section 1905(n)(2) of the Act who is receiving covered
inpatient services in a hospital or a long-term care facility on the date he or she attains the maximum age for Medicaid
eligibility under the State plan until the end of the inpatient stay if the child or infant remains eligible, except
that he or she has attained that maximum age. This provision applies to the mandatory and optional categorically needy
eligibility groups of low-income infants and children described under section 1902(l) of the Act. Section 6401 of
OBRA '89 extended this provision to the new mandatory categorically needy group of low-income children age 1 up to
age 6 under section 1902(l)(1)(C) and section 4601 of OBRA '90 (by changes to section 1902(l)(1)(D)) to the new mandatory
categorically needy group of children born after September 30, 1983 who have not attained age 19 also. (In addition,
section 302(b) of MCCA further clarified this provision by adding in the matter after paragraph (F) of section 1902(a)(10)
a new paragraph (X) to provide that States that impose durational limits on payments for inpatient hospital services
must establish exceptions to these limits for medically necessary inpatient services received by an infant up to
age 1 in a hospital designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the State's Medicaid plan. Regulations
to interpret section 302(b) of MCCA are included in a separate document that is under development.)

of the Act who are receiving covered inpatient services on the date they attain the maximum age for Medicaid eligibility
under the State plan until the end of the inpatient stay if the infant or child remains eligible except for attainment
of the maximum age; and make conforming changes to &sect;&sect;435.500 and 436.500.

F. Low-Income Aged and Disabled Individuals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9402 of OBRA '86 amended the Social Security Act by adding new sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X) and 1902(m)
to establish an optional categorically needy eligibility group of aged and disabled individuals with incomes at
or below the Federal poverty income level. Section 1902(m) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4118(p)(8)
of OBRA '87 and section 301(e) of MCCA, describes individuals in this group as those who are 65 years of age or older or
are disabled as determined under SSI, whose income does not exceed a standard established by the State that is set at
a percentage (at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level, and whose resources do not exceed the maximum
amount of resources allowed under SSI. If a State has a medically needy program with a more generous resource level,
section 1902(m)(2)(B) allows a State to elect to use the medically needy resource level instead of the SSI resource
level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989, States were permitted to provide eligibility to this optional group of low-income
aged and disabled individuals only if they also provided Medicaid eligibility to the low-income group of pregnant
women and infants under the provisions of section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) as added by section 9401 of OBRA '86 discussed
earlier. Section 301(e)(2)(D) of MCCA removed the condition for providing eligibility to both groups, effective
July 1, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income eligibility for this optional group of aged and disabled individuals is based on a standard established at
a level that is at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines for a family of the size involved. The
term ``family of the size involved,'' as used in section 1902(m)(2)(A), is not specifically defined in the statute.
However, for this optional group of aged and disabled we believe that it would be appropriate to adopt for individuals
and couples who seek eligibility under section 1902(m) of the Act the SSI program's distinction between eligible
individuals and eligible couples, depending on whether the individual alone is eligible or both members of the couple
are eligible under section 1902(m). Since the statute requires that income be determined using the principles of
section 1612, which are SSI program rules, using SSI's individual and couple distinction as well as SSI's deeming
rules enables States to have a clear understanding of the baseline for determining eligibility for members of this
poverty level-related group. It also avoids potential conflicts with section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which could
result if eligibility for this group were determined by pooling family income (if the family included individuals
other than a husband and wife).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSI program determines eligibility for couples, or for individuals. If the SSI definition of a couple (i.e., the
couple is married and they qualify for SSI benefits as an eligible couple) is not met, eligibility is determined on
an individual basis. We propose to apply this principle to determine eligibility for the optional Medicaid aged and
disabled group. If two individuals are married and are both eligible under section 1902(m), both spouses will be considered
a couple even if only one spouse applied for medical assistance and their income will be compared to the Federal poverty
level for a family of two. If both individuals in a family are not eligible as a couple under section 1902(m), their eligibility
will be determined as individuals, with their incomes being compared to the poverty level for an individual, and deeming
of income and resources from responsible family members using SSI deeming methodologies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1902(m) of the Act has always specified that resources of individuals under the low-income optional categorically
needy group of aged and disabled individuals may not exceed the SSI limits, and that SSI methodologies must be used
to determine countable income and resources. However, section 1902(r)(2) of the Act, as added by section 303(e) of
MCCA, does permit States, at their option, to use less restrictive requirements than SSI for optional categorically
needy groups. However, in spite of section 1902(r)(2), we do not believe that States are authorized to allow individuals
to deduct (spend down) the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care from income in order to
meet the income standard established, except as they are permitted to do so under SSI if the individual is a severely
disabled person who works. This is because section 1902(m)(3)(B) of the Act specifically prohibits the use of an income
spenddown, except in the case of individuals covered by section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act. Under this exception,
a severely disabled individual who works is allowed to deduct from income the reasonable costs for attendant care
services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (generally not including routine
drugs or routine medical services) that are necessary in order for the individual to work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6411(a) of OBRA '89 amended section 1902(f) of the Act to eliminate the option to use more restrictive eligibility
criteria than are used by the SSI program for certain eligibility groups. One of those groups is the optional low-income
aged and disabled group. Therefore, section 1902(f) States that elect to cover the section 1902(m) group must use
SSI eligibility methodologies, and the statutorily mandated income and resource standards, in determining eligibility
for individuals under this group. The only exception is that section 1902(f) States can use more liberal criteria
under section 1902(r)(2). (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands would use the SSI disability definition under
section 1614 of the Act and the methodologies for determining income and resource eligibility applied under sections
1612 and 1613, or less restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2), as appropriate.
This is because the reference in section 1902(m) relating to disability and financial methodologies is to those of
title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to those of the State plan program under title XVI.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4501(e)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1905(p)(2) of the Act by adding paragraph (D) to provide that, in determining
income eligibility for qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs) who are entitled to monthly title II insurance benefits,
any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in these title II benefits received beginning in December of the preceding
year must be disregarded. We will issue a separate regulation incorporating this provision for QMBs. Section 4501(e)(2)
of OBRA '90 made this rule also apply to the income eligibility determinations of the aged and disabled individuals
covered by section 1902(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disregard applies to all the months from the month the COLA increase is effective through the month after the month
the revised poverty levels are published each year. Since the new poverty levels are usually published in February,
the disregard normally will be effective through March of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for Medicaid purposes, the new poverty levels are effective upon publication. This means that, for the period
between publication of the poverty levels (usually mid-February) and the end of the disregard period (usually March),
the disregard of the COLA increase and the poverty level increase would overlap. As a result of this overlap, some individuals
would meet the income level for this group because the COLA disregard would lower their countable income at the same
time that the revised poverty level would allow for higher income. As soon as the COLA disregard expired, these individuals
would lose eligibility again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that this approach would create an unreasonable administrative burden for States. They would have to add
these individuals to the Medicaid rolls, only to have to remove them again a few weeks later. We also believe that the
intent of the statutory provision is to protect individuals who would lose that status for a few weeks because of the
COLA increase (but only until the increase in the poverty level took effect), and not to permit other individuals to
achieve eligibility status for a few weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we are proposing to make the revised poverty levels effective for title II recipients with the month
after the last month in which the COLA disregard is effective. Since the COLA disregard normally expires at the end
of March, in most years, the new poverty levels would be effective for these individuals on April 1. By delaying the
effective date of the increased poverty level so that it coincides with the date on which the COLA increase is first
counted, we would eliminate the problem discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9402 of OBRA '86 does not require or permit the different treatment of income and resources allowed for this
low-income aged and disabled eligibility group to be applied to other Medicaid eligibility groups because of the
comparability provisions of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act. In addition, we propose to require that if a State elects
to provide Medicaid eligibility to this low-income group, it must cover both the aged and disabled and must apply the
same income and resource standards to both groups and to all family sizes involved. This requirement is consistent
with the intent of Congress, as expressed in the language of the House Committee Report accompanying OBRA '86 (H. Rep.
727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 103 (1986)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid services provided to the optional group of low-income aged and disabled individuals must be the same in amount,
duration, and scope as the Medicaid services provided to other categorically needy individuals under the approved
State Medicaid plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments made by section 9402 of OBRA '86 apply to payments to States for services for calendar quarters beginning
on or after July 1, 1987, without regard to whether or not final regulations to carry them out have been published by
that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to incorporate the provisions of sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X) and 1902(m) of the Act and section 9402
of OBRA '86 in the Medicaid regulations by adding &sect;435.238 (&sect;436.235 for the Territories) to specify the
optional categorically needy eligibility group of aged and disabled individuals with incomes at or below Federal
poverty income guidelines and the conditions under which they may establish eligibility. We also propose to add a
new &sect;&sect;435.615 and 436.615 to specify the requirements for establishing the income and resource standards
and methodologies for this group and for determining financial eligibility.

G. Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9407 of OBRA '86 added a new section 1902(a)(47) to the Act, redesignated section 1920 as section 1921, and
added a new section 1920 to allow States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to certain needy pregnant women to help
ensure that these women receive health care early in pregnancy. Section 411(k)(16)(B) of the MCCA and section 4605
of OBRA '90 amended section 1920. Under section 1920, ambulatory prenatal care is available during a presumptive
eligibility period on the basis of income eligibility only before a woman is formally determined to be eligible or
ineligible for Medicaid and for a specified number of days while a woman is waiting for a Medicaid eligibility determination.
Under the statutory provisions, a qualified provider, who is defined in section 1920(b)(2), determines whether
a pregnant woman is presumptively eligible for Medicaid. These qualified providers make the presumptive eligibility
determination on the basis of preliminary information about the pregnant woman's family income. The qualified provider
determines whether the pregnant woman's family income appears to meet the income criteria applied to any of the eligibility
groups specified in the approved State Medicaid plan under which the pregnant woman might be eligible. At the time
of the determination, a qualified provider must refer a pregnant woman to the Medicaid agency. The qualified provider
must also assist a pregnant woman in completing and filing an application for full Medicaid services if she wishes
to apply for Medicaid at that time. The Medicaid agency then would establish whether or not she is eligible for regular
Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any provider that is eligible for payment under the State plan for services which the State considers to be ambulatory
prenatal care can furnish these services to presumptively eligible pregnant women during the presumptive period.
(We note that the purpose of presumptive eligibility is to provide temporary, limited coverage to pregnant women
who are likely to be eligible for Medicaid. Under section 1905(a) of the Act, individuals who are inmates in public
institutions are ineligible for Medicaid. Therefore, because she is not ``likely to be eligible for Medicaid,''
any pregnant woman who is an inmate in a public institution could not be determined presumptively eligible for Medicaid
and receive ambulatory prenatal care under section 1920 of the Act.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 1920(b)(1), as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4605 of OBRA '90, the presumptive
period of eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care begins on the day a qualified provider makes a presumptive eligibility
determination. The pregnant woman then has until the last calendar day of the month following the month in which the
presumptive eligibility determination was made to file a regular Medicaid application with the Medicaid agency.
If she does not file a regular Medicaid application by that last day, presumptive eligibility ends on that last day.
If she files a regular Medicaid application, presumptive eligibility under section 1920 ends on the date a decision
is made on the regular Medicaid application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to allow only one presumptive eligibility period for any one pregnancy. We believe that this limitation
is consistent with the intent of Congress as evidenced in the language of the Senate Committee Report on OBRA '86 (S.
Rep. 348, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1986)). In explaining the provision, the Committee stated that under the presumptive
eligibility program, States may ``for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any one pregnancy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
grant presumptive eligibility for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a period 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
not to exceed *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). Congress' use of the underscored phrases leads to the conclusion
that only one presumptive period was intended. We solicit comments on the proposed policy to allow only one presumptive
eligibility period per pregnancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new section 1920 specifies that a presumptive eligibility determination is to be made if the pregnant woman appears
to the qualified provider, on the basis of preliminary information supplied by her on family income, to meet the applicable
income level of eligibility only. Resources and other Medicaid eligibility requirements that would be considered
under the approved State plan if the woman were to apply for regular Medicaid benefits are not considered in making
the presumptive eligibility determination. In addition, section 1920 provides that a determination of presumptive
eligibility be based on ``preliminary information'' about family income. Therefore, a qualified provider may only
request information that is correct based upon a pregnant woman's best information and belief and may not require
exact information under a penalty of perjury. A State may require that women reveal what their incomes are or only that
their incomes are below the applicable level.

In implementing the provisions of section 1920 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify that presumptive eligibility determinations must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on family income, we would require the qualified

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level (without spenddown). This means that income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disregards are not considered, and in the case of blind or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled individuals in section 1902(f) States, or in States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have a medically needy program, the cost of incurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical expenses could not be deducted in order to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income to the allowed income level (spending down). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration of disregards and incurred medical expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would allow some women to have income above the ``applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level'' specified in section 1920(b)(1)(A). We believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress intended by the use of the term ``applicable level'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require qualified providers only to make simple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations and not complicated adjustments of income such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as those involved in applying spenddown rules or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disregarding certain types of income. To impose detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations and complicated adjustments on providers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be administratively burdensome and contrary to efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration because of the short-term nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive eligibility status and because no other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility requirements (not even resources) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. We believe that we are not imposing an undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardship on a pregnant woman by not allowing spenddown or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not disregarding certain income. If the provider makes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision that the woman does not ``appear'' to meet the income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria, the pregnant woman still has the right to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for regular Medicaid within a reasonable period of time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a formal eligibility determination made. Under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal eligibility determination, the agency may find that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pregnant woman is retroactively eligible for regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid during the presumptive period under the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of section 1902(a)(34) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1920(b)(2) of the Act, as added by OBRA '86 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended by section 411(k)(16) of MCCA, specifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications that a provider must meet in order to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to make presumptive eligibility determinations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider must_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be eligible to receive payments under Medicaid; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be an entity that provides services of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following type: outpatient hospital services as specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 1905(a)(2)(A) of the Act or rural health clinic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services and any other ambulatory services offered by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rural health clinic and otherwise included in the plan as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 1905(a)(2)(B); or be an entity that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides clinic services by or under the direction of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician described in section 1905(a)(9) of the Act;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All providers who meet the criteria listed above must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered qualified providers. Therefore, if a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that a provider is not capable of making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive eligibility determinations for pregnant women, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provider would not be considered ``qualified'' to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these determinations. We would permit States to exclude a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider that is qualified only under very narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances; that is, if a State can demonstrate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is good cause to exclude the provider. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we wish to give States maximum flexibility in meeting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of pregnant women and, therefore, propose to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to determine whether a program is a ``State perinatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In interpreting the provisions of section 1920(b), we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require States to provide qualified providers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper screening forms for pregnant women to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision of presumptive eligibility. We also would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States to provide instructions to qualified providers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to apply the gross income criteria under the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups under the State's approved Medicaid plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and how to determine the highest income criteria group under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the pregnant woman is most likely to be eligible if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she applies for regular Medicaid. We are not prescribing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specific content and format of the screening forms or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions. However, we expect State instructions to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in enough detail to allow a qualified provider (based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preliminary information provided by a pregnant woman) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make reasonably accurate income eligibility determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 1920(c)(1), we would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies to furnish qualified providers with regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid application forms and train them to assist pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women who wish to apply in completing and filing these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms. As provided by section 1920(c)(3) of the Act as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended by section 4605 of OBRA '90, the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided may be an application developed by the State for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use by pregnant women who wish to apply as low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1920(c)(3) of the Act seems to contemplate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for regular Medicaid that is separate from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening form for presumptive eligibility for ambulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prenatal care. We believe the presumptive eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening form and the regular Medicaid application can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined. However, pregnant women cannot be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide all of the information necessary for a full-scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid application when applying for only presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. If the forms are combined, a State agency can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer the pregnant woman the option to complete the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application but cannot require that she do so in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish presumptive eligibility. A qualified provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must make a presumptive eligibility determination once a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant woman has provided information about her family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income and cannot require additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A presumptive eligibility screening form alone cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to establish a filing date for a regular Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. If a combined presumptive eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening form and Medicaid application is used and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
woman chooses to complete the entire application, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed application form must be forwarded promptly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate State agency for a decision on regular Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility under the plan once the qualified provider makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a decision on presumptive eligibility. In this situation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date the completed form is received by the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the Medicaid filing date for Medicaid eligibility. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the woman is determined to be eligible, this date will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the beginning of the period in which she qualifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the more extensive services under the plan and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the month used to determine the dates of the 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months of retroactive eligibility, if the woman would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been eligible during the retroactive period. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter approach, pregnant women would not be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file another application. However, they would not be exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from meeting with State agency staff as appropriate or from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing additional information necessary to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility under the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A modified approach under this option would be to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency staff on site at qualified provider locations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to supervise or actually assist pregnant women in completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application form. In these cases, the application date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for regular Medicaid plan services would be the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onsite State agency staff person receives the completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. This would result in an earlier Medicaid filing date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, even though State agency staff who are working at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified provider locations can receive and process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for regular Medicaid, they cannot make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive eligibility determinations unless they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves meet the definition of ``qualified provider'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1920(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since we are considering pregnant women who apply only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting to receive services under a special status (that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, not regular Medicaid eligibility), we propose not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to a decision on presumptive eligibility the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirements that a State must meet when it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes a decision on a regular Medicaid application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations under &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.912 and part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
431, subpart E, require Medicaid agencies to notify Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants within a specified period of time of the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision on a regular Medicaid application, the reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decision, and an explanation of rights to a hearing if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application is denied. Although we propose not to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.912 and part 431, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart E, to presumptive eligibility decisions, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that the qualified provider inform a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant woman in writing of the presumptive eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision at the time of the determination. In the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of presumptive eligibility, the qualified provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to inform the woman in writing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason for the denial of this special status and of her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to apply to the State agency for an eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision for regular Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 1920 of the Act, we propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require the qualified provider to inform, in writing, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant woman who is determined presumptively eligible that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she is required to file a regular Medicaid application by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the last day of the month following the month in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive determination is made if she wishes to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive ambulatory prenatal care after that date. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified provider must inform the pregnant woman in writing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if she does not file her application for regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid by the last day of the month following the month in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which she was determined presumptively eligible, her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive eligibility will end on that date. However, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she files within the deadline, she will remain presumptively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible until she has a regular Medicaid determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of section 1920(c)(2), the qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider also must notify the State agency within 5 working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the date on which the provider determines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pregnant woman is presumptively eligible.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the procedures under &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.912 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying individuals of actions on applications would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to presumptive eligibility decisions for ambulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prenatal care, they would apply to regular Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications filed after the presumptive eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination is made. Because we do not consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid per se, and because termination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambulatory prenatal care benefits occurs automatically after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified time periods under section 1920 of the Act, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also propose not to apply the existing provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that require Medicaid agencies to provide timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written notice of reduction or termination of Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits and rights to appeal of an adverse action (part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
431, subpart E and &sect;435.919). As indicated earlier, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose to require a qualified provider to provide written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the date a pregnant woman can expect presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care to end. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we propose not to grant rights to appeal a denial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination of ambulatory prenatal care services under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumptive eligibility decision. A presumptively eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant woman who subsequently files a regular Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application that is denied would have the right to appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial of her regular Medicaid application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that we are imposing an undue burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on qualified providers by requiring that notification by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified provider be in writing. We do not foresee that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this written notice will be individual personal letters. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered requiring States to supply qualified providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with preprinted notices. However, we decided to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States the flexibility to determine how to best arrange for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this notification within each State program. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly solicit comments on whether the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that notification by a qualified provider be in writing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes an undue hardship on qualified providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations at &sect;435.914 permit States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide Medicaid for an entire month when an individual is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for Medicaid under the plan at any time during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month. We propose not to permit States to provide full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month eligibility for presumptive eligibility periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because by definition a presumptive determination is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of Medicaid eligibility but eligibility for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special status. Therefore, special status eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins on the exact date a presumptive eligibility decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made and ends on the last day of the month following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month in which the presumptive decision is made when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid application has not been filed, or on the date a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal decision of Medicaid eligibility is made if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been filed. However, full month regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility is available during the approval month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a regular Medicaid application in States that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elected full month coverage in their approved State Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9407 of OBRA '86, as amended by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
411(k)(16) of MCCA, provides that, for purposes of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial participation, ambulatory prenatal care services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are covered under the plan, are furnished by a provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is eligible for payment under the State plan, and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to pregnant women during a presumptive period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility, will be treated as expenditures for medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance under the State plan and thus are regarded as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid plan services. If the State makes any payments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambulatory prenatal care furnished by an eligible provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the presumptive period for women who are later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be ineligible for Medicaid, these payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be counted in determining a State's excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous payments for purposes of disallowing Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial participation. In general, Medicaid quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control will not review the accuracy of presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility determinations in terms of predicting a pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
woman's eligibility for Medicaid, and any erroneous payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made cannot be counted in determining the State's erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments for purposes of quality control eligibility errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, quality control will review claims for services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to presumptively eligible pregnant women to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether these claims were, in fact, made for women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who were pregnant and were for ambulatory prenatal services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered under the State plan, were furnished by a provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is eligible to receive payment under the State plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and were furnished during a period of presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. There will be situations in which the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished by a qualified provider will include verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a woman's pregnancy. The services that are furnished for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification will be covered as presumptive eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services for FFP purposes only if the woman is actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant. Section 1920 covers only ambulatory prenatal care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made available to a pregnant woman during a specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. Services furnished to deliver or remove an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
embryo/fetus from the mother or furnished following that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery or removal will not be covered as presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility services for FFP purposes. That is because, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the embryo/fetus is no longer viable, the woman is no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be a pregnant woman. Also, we do not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the services involved in delivering either a viable or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonviable fetus constitute prenatal services. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any services furnished following removal or delivery would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be furnished to a pregnant woman nor would they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute prenatal care.

We also expect States to monitor decisions made by specific qualified providers to assure the accuracy and integrity
of the determinations and to take any corrective actions that may be necessary. Therefore, we are proposing to require
States to monitor presumptive eligibility decisions.

We propose to amend the Medicaid regulations to incorporate the provisions of section 9407 of OBRA '86, section 411(k)(16)
of MCCA, and section 4605 of OBRA '90 as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revise &sect;&sect;431.864 and 431.865 to specify that excess erroneous payments for purposes of disallowance
of Federal financial participation do not include erroneous payments for ambulatory prenatal care covered under
the State plan, and provided to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period by a provider eligible for
Medicaid payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add &sect;&sect;435.250 and 436.250 to specify optional coverage of pregnant women during a presumptive
eligibility period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amend &sect;435.907 to clarify what constitutes a formal Medicaid application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add a new &sect;435.911 to specify the screening and application requirements and procedures for making presumptive
eligibility determinations. Existing &sect;&sect;435.911 through 435.914 would be redesignated as &sect;&sect;435.914
through 435.917, respectively, to allow the incorporation of the new &sect;435.911.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add a new &sect;435.912 to specify the application requirements for pregnant women following the presumptive
eligibility determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amend &sect;&sect;435.1001 and 436.1001 to clarify that FFP is available in the necessary administrative
costs the State incurs in determining presumptive eligibility for pregnant women and in providing ambulatory prenatal
care to presumptively eligible women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revise &sect;440.1 to add the statutory basis for providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during
a presumptive eligibility period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add &sect;440.172 to define ambulatory prenatal care and qualified provider.

H. Enhancement of Pregnancy Outcomes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we have discussed earlier in two sections of this document, Congress has expanded mandatory and optional Medicaid
eligibility for pregnant women as part of an overall effort to combat the problem of infant mortality and incidences
of low-birth weight through provision of needed health services to low-income pregnant women. In addition, we believe
that we must focus State attention on the need for special vigilance in cases of high-risk pregnancy in order to maximize
the cost effectiveness of the increased Medicaid investments. Examples of high-risk pregnancies include those
in which the women have a complicating medical condition, complications that may result from genetic factors, or
a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is much evidence that many adverse birth outcomes are preventible
through timely and appropriate intervention by health and social services agencies, with the potential for reducing
infant mortality, the use of high-cost neonatal intensive care services, and the incidence of long-term care services
associated with extended or lifelong disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to add &sect;435.935 to the Medicaid regulations to require States to define a high-risk pregnancy, to
describe the methods they will apply to identify high-risk pregnant women, and to specify steps that individuals,
groups, and organizations involved in the service delivery system will take to ensure that these women will receive
services designed to enhance pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child. The purpose of defining these terms
is to assist States in their efforts to see that pregnant Medicaid recipients receive the full range of medical and
related services appropriate to their risk status.

We are proposing to impose these requirements on States under the authority of sections 1902(a) (4) and (19) of the
Act. These provisions, respectively, require that the Medicaid State plan provide for such methods of administration
as are found necessary by the Secretary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan, and provide such safeguards
as may be necessary to assure that eligibility for care and services under the plan will be determined, and the care
and services will be provided in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We specially solicit comment on the proposal to require States to target potentially high risk pregnant women. Moreover,
we are interested in comments on the effectiveness of a State plan amendment to achieve this goal.

I. Clarification of Medicaid to Homeless Individuals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9405 of OBRA '86 revised section 1902(b)(2) of the Act to prohibit States from imposing any residence requirement
that excludes from Medicaid an otherwise eligible individual who resides in the State, but does not maintain a residence
permanently or at a fixed address. Before this provision was enacted, some States were requiring applicants for Medicaid
to furnish a fixed address or evidence of a permanent residence in order to qualify for Medicaid, even though this was
not a Federal requirement. In addition, section 11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act added section
1902(a)(48) to the Act to require, as a State plan requirement, that States establish a method for making Medicaid
eligibility cards available to an eligible individual who does not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address.
This provision was effective on January 1, 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of affording States maximum flexibility in the administration of their Medicaid programs, we are
not proposing to impose a specific method to be used to issue Medicaid eligibility cards to homeless individuals.
However, the State would be required to describe the method in its State plan. The method, as part of the State plan,
would be subject to approval by HCFA. HCFA will approve any reasonable method that ensures the timely issuance of cards
and receipt of Medicaid and that does not impose an undue hardship on the homeless individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amend &sect;&sect;435.403 and 436.403 to add the prohibition against requiring otherwise eligible homeless
individuals to have a fixed address or reside in a permanent dwelling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add a new &sect;435.932 to specify the State plan requirement that a State must establish and specify a method
for issuing Medicaid eligibility cards to homeless individuals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large volume of public comments that we usually receive on notices of proposed rulemaking, we cannot
acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will address all public comments received on this document
in the preamble to the document in which these proposed regulations are issued in final form.

IV. Paperwork Burden
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 435.612(f), 435.615(e), 435.907, 435.911, 435.918, 435.932, 435.935, 436.612(e), 436.615(e), 447.51,
and 447.60 contain information collection and reporting requirements that are subject to review by the Office of
Management and Budget under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). We have submitted
these proposed regulations to OMB for review. The reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated
to be 6 hours per response. A notice will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when approval is obtained. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of information collection
must be addressed to the specified office indicated under the ``

V. Regulatory Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of RFA, we consider all providers and suppliers
of health care as small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. We are
not preparing a RFA because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of providers and suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital which is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We
are not preparing a rural hospital impact statement because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that
this proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of
small rural hospitals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed rule is not an ``economically significant'' rule under Executive Order 12866, the statutory
changes which are the basis of this proposed rule, are substantial. We present below a voluntary anaylsis of these
effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would incorporate in regulations, and in some cases interpret, statutory changes that are already
in effect. In cases where it was necessary to provide interpretation, we have relied on the legislative history of
the statutory provisions, when available, for the best reading of the provision. The statutory provisions are effective
on the statutorily established date, regardless of whether or not we have issued final regulations. The statutory
changes that expand eligibility groups and coverage of services will increase Medicaid program expenditures independently
of the promulgation of this rule. Costs associated with these proposed regulations are the result of legislation
or due to the interpretation of statutory changes already in effect. Therefore, these costs have been included in
the Medicaid budget estimates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is difficult to predict what the fiscal impact will be since several provisions provide Medicaid coverage to certain
groups at the option of States. Another unknown factor is the additional number of pregnant women, infants, and children
and disabled, elderly, and homeless individuals who will be offered services that previously were not covered by
the States and the type and cost of these specific services. We know costs for States will rise as they begin to furnish
the additional services that will be required if medically necessary. The following data reflects our estimate of
medical costs attributable to expansion of services under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Public
Law 100&hyph;203; the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;360; the Family Support Act
of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;485; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;239; and the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;508. The following estimates are based on data from
the census, current population survey, and average cost using Medicaid data:

Several alternatives were considered in the development of these proposed regulations and are discussed in detail
earlier in the preamble: Two of the more significant ones involve continuous eligibility of pregnant women and deemed
newborn eligibility under sections II. B and II. D, respectively, of the preamble. Our proposed interpretation of
the statutory provisions relating to these two areas would have minimal cost effects and will probably save money
through better management of high risk pregnancies. At most, the proposed interpretation of the provision relating
to continuous eligibility of newborn children would cost $10 million, a very small addition to the statutory costs
included in the above tables. However, we believe that most States have already adopted our proposed interpretation
as practice.

(a) The agency must provide categorically needy Medicaid eligibility to a child born to a woman who is eligible as categorically
needy and is receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth. The child is deemed to have applied and been found eligible
for Medicaid on the date of birth and remains eligible as categorically needy for one year so long as the woman remains
eligible or (with respect to infants born on or after January 1, 1991) would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remained eligible if still pregnant and the child is a member of the woman's household. If the mother's basis of eligibility

(b) An infant is considered to be a member of his or her mother's household for so long as he or she is continuously hospitalized
after birth, unless the mother has legally relinquished control of the child or the State has established that she
has abandoned the child. After the infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not involving hospitalization,
States must apply the AFDC rules to determine if an infant (who is not an SSI beneficiary) is a member of his or her mother's
household.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the agency provides Medicaid to aged and disabled individuals under &sect;435.238, it must determine financial
eligibility in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishing the income standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The agency must establish and apply an income standard at a level that does not exceed 100 percent of the Federal
poverty income guidelines applicable to a family of the size involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this section, ``family of the size involved'' is based on the SSI concept of eligibility for an individual
as an individual or as part of a couple. If two individuals in a family are married and eligible under section 1902(m),
their income will be compared to the Federal poverty income level for a family of two. In all other situations, eligibility
will be determined on an individual basis, using the poverty level for one, with deeming of income as appropriate (under
SSI deeming rules that do not conflict with title XIX of the Act).

(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methodologies for determining income and resources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) (2) through (4) of this section, in determining financial eligibility,
the agency must use the income and resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies applied under SSI, or it may instead use any less restrictive income and resource methodologies than
SSI as specified in the approved State plan in accordance with &sect;435.601. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The agency may not deduct from income the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care in order
to reduce the individual's income to the established income standard, except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For severely disabled individuals who work, the agency may deduct the reasonable costs for attendant care services,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Title II COLA increases must be disregarded from December of each year through the month after the month in which the
Federal poverty guideline for the next year is published. During that period, the poverty level for the previous year
will be used for these individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State plan requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The agency must promptly redetermine eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when it receives information about changes in a recipient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances that may affect his or her eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the agency has information about anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in a recipient's circumstances, it must redetermine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility at the appropriate time based on those changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effective January 1, 1991, the agency must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider any pregnant woman who has established eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicaid under this part and who, because of a change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family income, would no longer be eligible, to be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive services as mandatory categorically needy under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;435.118 throughout the pregnancy and the 60-day period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after pregnancy ends and for any remaining days in the month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the 60th day falls, without regard to any changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in income that may occur during this period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) This provision does not apply to women who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be presumptively eligible under &sect;435.250 but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subsequently determined to be ineligible for regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A woman who is eligible for continued coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this section retains her existing status as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory categorically needy, optional categorically needy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or medically needy recipient, even though she is entitled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the services that are available to a mandatory categorically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needy pregnant woman described in &sect;435.118. As a result, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she must continue to meet eligibility requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with her status (for example, she may have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet a spenddown if she is medically needy), except that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in income will have no effect on her eligibility.

(a) The agency must provide categorically needy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility to a child born to a woman who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible as categorically needy and is receiving Medicaid on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date of the child's birth. The child is deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birth and remains eligible as categorically needy for one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year so long as the woman remains eligible or (with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to infants born on or after January 1, 1991) would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remained eligible if still pregnant and the child is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the woman's household. If the mother's basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility changes to medically needy, the child is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible as medically needy under &sect;436.301(b)(1)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An infant is considered to be a member of his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously hospitalized after birth, unless the mother has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally relinquished control of the child or the State has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established that she has abandoned the child. After the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving hospitalization, States must apply the AFDC rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a member of his or her mother's household.

(iii) All newborn children born to a woman who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible as medically needy and is receiving Medicaid on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the child's birth. The child is deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birth and remains eligible as medically needy for one year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so long as the woman remains eligible or (with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants born on or after January 1, 1991) would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remained eligible if still pregnant and the child is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the woman's household (as determined in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

poverty income guidelines applicable to a family of the size involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this section, family of the size involved is based on the SSI concept of eligibility for an individual
as an individual or as part of a couple. If two individuals are married and eligible under section 1902(m), their income
will be compared to the Federal poverty income level for a family of two. In all other situations, eligibility will
be determined on an individual basis, using the poverty level for one, with deeming of income as appropriate (under
SSI deeming rules that do not conflict with title XIX of the Act).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methodologies for determining income and resources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) (2) through (4) of this section, the agency must use the methodologies
applied under sections 1612 and 1613 of the Act in determining countable income and resources or may instead use any
less restrictive income and resource methodologies specified in the State plan in accordance with &sect;436.601.
Methodologies include, but are not limited to, those used in disregarding income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The agency may not deduct from income the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care to reduce
the individual's income to the established income standard, except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For severely disabled individuals who work, the agency may deduct the reasonable costs for attendant care services,
medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (generally not including routine drugs
or routine medical services) that are necessary in order for the individual to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In determining the financial responsibilities of relatives, the agency must apply the requirements of &sect;436.602.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In determining eligibility under this section for an individual entitled to monthly social security cash benefits,
Title II COLA increases must be disregarded from December of each year through the month after the month in which the
Federal poverty guideline for the next year is published. During that period, the poverty level for the previous year
will be used for these individuals.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list the San Xavier talussnail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Sonorella eremita
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Xavier talussnail is found only in an area of 15 by 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meters (m) (50 by 100 feet (ft)) on private land in Pima County, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arizona. The primary threat to the species results from its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerability to habitat disturbances that would remove talus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase interstitial soil, or alter moisture accumulation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retention. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection provided by the Act for the San Xavier talussnail. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service seeks data and comments from the public on this proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The San Xavier talussnail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sonorella eremita
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a land snail, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first described in 1910 by H.A. Pilsbry and L.E. Daniels (Pilsbry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Ferriss 1915). The species has a globose shell with as many as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.5 whorls, a white to pinkish tint, and a chestnut-brown shoulder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
band. It is approximately 19 millimeters (0.7 inches) in diameter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the only land snail fitting this description in the Mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hills area, but its shell is very typical of desert 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sonorella 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Xavier talussnail lives in a deep, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northwestward-facing, limestone rockslide in Pima County, Arizona. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Its habitat is protected from drying effects of the sun by outcrops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of limestone and decomposed granite to the northeast and southwest, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and by the hill itself to the southeast (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hoffman 1990). The vegetation, slope of the hillside, and depth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slide provide necessary moisture conditions. This talussnail is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to other 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sonorella 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species in that it feeds on fungus or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decaying plant material (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier talussnail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is hermaphroditic (Morton 1968, Hoffman 1990). After a rain, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snail will lay eggs, feed, and mate. Fertilization and production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of eggs takes several days. If the rains are short-lived, the eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are held until the next rain. The species requires three or four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years to mature, depending on rainfall frequency, and has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive life of four to six years, depending on the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of days it remains active (Hoffman 1990).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Talussnails are extremely sensitive to desiccation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sedimentation resulting from disturbance of the talus and associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetation. In general, desert snails are known to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves from drying out by crawling into deep, cool rockslides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not filled with soil. The limestone rock or other talus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contains calcium carbonate is crucial to the species, as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aids in shell deposition and neutralizes carbonic acid that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced during estivation (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
talussnail is known to estivate for up to three years and in most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years is only active for three or four days (Hoffman 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Xavier talussnail was included as a Category 2 species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Service's May 22, 1984, notice of review of candidate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invertebrates (49 FR 21664) and in the January 6, 1989, animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate notice of review (54 FR 554). Category 2 species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those for which the Service has some evidence of vulnerability, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which there is insufficient scientific and commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to support proposed rules at the time. The San Xavier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
talussnail was included as a Category 1 species in the November 21, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991, animal candidate notice of review (56 FR 58804). Category 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species are those for which the Service has sufficient biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to support proposals for listing.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to the San Xavier talussnail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sonorella eremita
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curtailment of its habitat or range. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The San Xavier talussnail is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very restricted endemic and is extremely vulnerable to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disturbance that would remove talus, increase interstitial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sedimentation, or otherwise alter moisture conditions in its habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., road or trail expansion or alteration, mining exploration) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Hoffman 1990). Within the species' habitat are inactive mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospects and mines, mining stakes, a powerline across the east 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ridge, and a road leading to a microwave site on the hilltop. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large copper mine is located nearby. There are housing developments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small acreage to the north and to the southwest of the hill. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat is too steep (30 to 40 percent slope) to permit house 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, but possible future threats include additional road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, expansion of the copper mine and/or tailings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small-scale prospecting and mining.

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The extremely restricted habitat of this species makes it vulnerable to excessive collecting during periods when
the snails are active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disease or predation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No diseases are known. Rodent predation is random and sporadic on the San Xavier talussnail (Hoffman 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Arizona offers no protection to this species. The Act would provide protection and encourage active management
through ``Available Conservation Measures'' discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The very restricted range of the San Xavier talussnail makes it vulnerable to extinction from relatively small-scale
human actions. The only known habitat for the species is on a single rockslide near Tucson, Arizona, in an area of limestone
talus about 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) near a dirt road. The habitat is located downslope from a dirt road, making it vulnerable
to infiltration of rocks and soil or other material. The species is so restricted in range that it is threatened by even
limited removal of cover through vandalism or by individuals curious about the presence of a rare species. Removal
of cover, including both rocks and vegetation, harms snails by exposing them to the drying effects of the sun and periods
of low ambient humidity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list the San Xavier talussnail as endangered. The species has a highly restricted range, is
located in an area of growing urban development and active mining, and is easily accessible by road. Although the San
Xavier talussnail is on private land, Federal actions may occur as the area continues to develop. Endangered status
is most appropriate because the single known population could be destroyed by one action. Because of the vulnerability
of the population, threatened status does not appear appropriate for the San Xavier talussnail. A decision to take
no action would exclude this species from needed protection available under the Act, and the species would likely
decline. The decision not to propose critical habitat for the San Xavier talussnail is explained in the following
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not prudent for the San Xavier talussnail at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extremely restricted habitat of the species makes it vulnerable to collection and isolated acts of vandalism.
Although there are relatively few amateur collectors of land snails, a single collection effort under advantageous
conditions could severely deplete the species' population. The population could, however, withstand some limited,
regulated scientific collection. Of greater concern than collection is the potential for acts of vandalism that
directly kill the snails by crushing or by habitat disturbances that cause desiccation of the snails. These acts may
sometimes be purposeful, but may also be caused by well-intentioned persons who are curious about the presence of
an endangered species. The likelihood of these potential threats occurring would be greatly increased by designation
of critical habitat, because the publication of critical habitat maps and descriptions would allow unauthorized
persons to precisely identify the locality of this species. Identification of critical habitat would therefore
increase the degree of threat to this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat designation would also not provide additional benefit to the species. The range and major ecological
requirements of this species are sufficiently known to provide adequate protection through the Act's take prohibitions
and application of the section 7 jeopardy standard. The Service will continue to communicate the conservation needs
of the species to the involved landowner, as well as inform the landowner of the status of legal protection and conservation
planning for the species.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Potential Federal activities
that may require consultation under section 7 include permits for road and transmission facilities near the locality
of the San Xavier talussnail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect;
or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,
carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the
Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22. Such permits are available for
scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in the course
of otherwise lawful activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed wildlife and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 420C, 4401 N. Fairfax
Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358&hyph;2104; FAX 703/358&hyph;2281).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts contain provisions which authorize EPA to treat Indian tribes in substantially
the same manner in which it treats states for purposes of various types of financial assistance and program authorization.
This action proposes amendments to regulations addressing the role of Indian tribes under both Acts. The purpose
of these proposed amendments is to make it easier for tribes to obtain EPA approval to assume the role Congress envisioned
for them under these statutes.

I. Introduction: Statutory and Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under its American Indian Policy, EPA works directly with tribal governments as ``sovereign entities with primary
authority and responsibility for the reservation populace.'' At the time the Policy was adopted in 1984, the environmental
statutes which EPA administers generally did not explicitly address the role of tribes in environmental management,
but provided for a joint state and federal role in environmental management. Subsequently, three EPA regulatory
statutes have been amended to address the tribal role specifically by authorizing EPA to treat tribes in a manner similar
to that in which it treats states: the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Clean Air Act
(CAA).

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or ``Superfund''),
which is primarily a response, rather than a regulatory statute, has also been amended to authorize EPA to treat tribal
governments in substantially the same way it treats states with respect to selected provisions of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that tribes are sovereign nations with a unique legal status and a relationship to the federal government
that is significantly different than that of states. EPA believes that Congress did not intend to alter this when it
authorized treatment of tribes ``as States;'' rather, the purpose of the statutory amendments was to reflect an intent
that, insofar as possible, tribes should assume a role in implementing the environmental statutes on tribal land
comparable to the role states play on state land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All three regulatory statutes specify that, in order to receive such treatment, a tribe must be federally recognized
and possess a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers. 33 U.S.C. 1377 (e), (h) (CWA); 42 U.S.C. 300j&hyph;11
(SDWA); 42 U.S.C. 7601(d) (CAA). In addition, although there are some variations in language among the three statutes,
each requires that a tribe possess civil regulatory jurisdiction to carry out the functions it seeks to exercise.

Under the Clean Water Act, the tribe must propose to carry out functions that ``pertain to the management and protection
of water resources which are held by an Indian tribe, held by the United States in trust for Indians, held by a member
of an Indian tribe if such property interest is subject to a trust restriction on alienation, or otherwise within the
borders of an Indian reservation.'' 33&blank;U.S.C. 1377(e)(2). Under the Clean Air Act, ``the functions to be exercised
by the Indian tribe (must) pertain to the management and protection of air resources within the exterior boundaries
of the reservation or other areas within the tribe's jurisdiction.'' 42 U.S.C. 7601(d)(2)(B). Under the SDWA, the

The Agency initially chose to implement provisions of the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts regarding Indian
tribes by establishing a formal prequalification process under which tribes can seek eligibility under these statutes.
This prequalification process has in the past been referred to as approval for ``treatment as a state'' (``TAS'').
Tribes that obtain such approval then become eligible to apply for certain grants and program approvals available
to states.

By contrast, the provision of CERCLA authorizing EPA to afford a tribal government ``substantially the same treatment
as a State'' does not establish any specific criteria a tribe must meet to qualify for such treatment. 42 U.S.C. 9626.
EPA has established, by regulation, the criteria of recognition, a government, and jurisdiction, but has not adopted
a formal prequalification process under CERCLA. See 40 CFR 300.515(b). The Agency is developing regulations pertaining
to the treatment of American Indian tribes under the Clean Air Act.

II. Regulations Governing Eligibility of Indian Tribes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Existing Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has promulgated five regulations that utilize the ``TAS'' process to date: (1) Safe Drinking Water Act,
National Drinking Water Regulations and Underground Injection Control Regulations for Indian Lands, 53 FR 37395
(September 26, 1988), codified at 40 CFR parts 35, 124, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, and 146; (2) Indian Tribes: Water Quality
Planning and Management, 54 FR 14353 (April 11, 1989), Comprehensive Construction Grant Regulation Revision, 55
FR 27092 (June 29, 1990) (governing grant programs under the CWA), codified at 40 CFR parts 35 and 130; (3) Amendments
to the Water Quality Standards Regulation that Pertain to Standards on Indian Reservations, 56 FR 64876 (December
12, 1991), codified at 40 CFR part 131; (4) Clean Water Act, section 404 Tribal Regulations, 58 FR 8171 (February 11,
1993), codified at 40 CFR parts 232 and 233; and (5) Treatment of Indian Tribes as States for Purposes of sections 308,
309, 401, 402, and 405 of the Clean Water Act (``NPDES'') rule, 58 FR 67966 (December 22, 1993), codified at 40 CFR parts
122, 123, 124 and 501. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under all of these regulations, before a tribe can obtain financial assistance available to states or obtain approval
to operate a program which states are authorized to operate on state lands, the tribe must first formally qualify for
``treatment as a state.'' To qualify, a tribe must submit an application establishing that it is federally recognized,
has a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers, and has adequate jurisdiction and capability to
carry out the proposed activities. Once a tribe obtains ``TAS'' approval, it is eligible to apply for financial assistance
and program approval.

1. Recognition and Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A tribe typically establishes recognition by showing its inclusion on the list of federally recognized Tribes published
by the Secretary of the Interior in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A tribe establishes that it meets the governmental duties and powers requirement with a narrative statement describing
the form of the tribal government and the types of functions it performs, and identifying the sources of the tribe's
governmental authority.

2. Jurisdiction and Capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To establish jurisdiction under the CWA grant regulations, a tribe must submit a statement signed by a tribal legal
official explaining the legal basis for the Tribe's regulatory authority over its water resources. The CWA grant
regulations do not require that a tribe submit any specific materials to establish capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other regulations specify that a tribe must submit various specific documents to establish jurisdiction, including:
a map or legal description of the area over which the tribe claims jurisdiction; a statement by a tribal legal official
describing the basis, nature, and subject matter of the tribe's jurisdiction; copies of all documents supporting
the jurisdictional assertions; and a description of the locations of the systems or sources the tribe proposes to
regulate. Similarly, to establish capability a tribe must submit a narrative statement describing tribal capability
to administer an effective program, and certain specific, listed materials in support of that statement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as to the substance of and basis for the jurisdictional assertions in the application, and invites comment on those
assertions. Where comments raise a competing or conflicting jurisdictional claim, the Agency must consult with
the Department of the Interior before making a final decision on the tribe's application.

The Agency defines this to include contiguous states, other tribes, and federal land agencies responsible for management
of lands contiguous to the reservation. (Amendments to the Water Quality Standards Regulation that Pertain to Standards
on Indian Reservations; Final Rule. 56 FR 64875, 64884 (December 12, 1991)). In response to public comments, EPA has
considered, but decided against, providing interested political subdivisions of states, including local governments
and water districts, the opportunity to comment on tribal jurisdictional assertions.

In practice, this comment process has sometimes led to delays in the processing and approval of tribal applications.
Indeed, it has proven to be the single portion of ``TAS'' review most responsible for delays. The comment process also
has created a perception that states have an oversight role in EPA's treatment of Indian tribes, which some tribes
find objectionable, particularly since tribes have typically not been asked to offer their views on the scope and
extent of state jurisdiction.

4. Subsequent Tribal Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations require a separate ``treatment as a state'' application for each program for which the tribe seeks
such treatment. However, after an initial approval, applications for each additional program need provide only
that additional information unique to the additional program.

B. Workgroup Examination of Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency's ``TAS'' prequalification process has proven to be burdensome, time-consuming and offensive to tribes.
Accordingly, in 1992 EPA established a working group to focus on ways of improving and simplifying that process. The
Agency formally adopted the Workgroup's recommendations as Agency policy by Memorandum dated November 10, 1992.
That Memorandum explicitly recognized that the policies it adopted would require amendments to existing regulations.
The purpose of this regulation is to propose amendments to existing regulations under the Safe Drinking Water and
Clean Water Acts in order to implement the new policy. To the extent possible, the Agency plans to use the same process
in future regulations regarding determinations of tribal eligibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Revisions to the Process in Light of Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No statute compels the use of a formal ``TAS'' or other prequalification process separate from approval of the underlying
request for a grant or program approval. The only requirements imposed by statute are that, to be eligible for financial
assistance and/or program authorization, a tribe must be federally recognized, have a governing body carrying out
substantial duties and powers, and have adequate jurisdiction and capability to carry out the proposed activities.
Thus, EPA may authorize a tribal program or grant without formally designating the tribe as ``eligible for TAS,''
so long as the Agency establishes that the tribe meets applicable statutory requirements. In other words, the Agency
can ensure compliance with statutory mandates without requiring tribes to undergo a discrete, formal process of
seeking ``TAS'' approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA is amending its regulations to eliminate ``TAS'' review as a separate step in the processing of a
tribal application for a grant or for program approval. Under the new, simplified process, the Agency will ensure
compliance with statutory requirements as an integral part of the process of reviewing grant or program approval
applications. To the extent that this rule or preamble conflicts with the language of previous rules and preambles,
the language herein shall be controlling. EPA will also, as far as possible, discontinue use of the term ``treatment
as a state;'' however, since this phrase is included in several statutes, its continued use may sometimes be necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Simplified Determination as to Recognition and Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general rule, the recognition and governmental requirements are essentially the same under the Clean Water and
Safe Drinking Water Acts. The new process will reflect this by establishing identical requirements for making this
showing under each statute. Moreover, the fact that a tribe has met the recognition or governmental functions requirement
under either of the Water Acts will establish that it meets those requirements under both statutes. To facilitate
review of tribal applications, EPA therefore requests that tribal applications inform EPA whether a tribe has been
approved for ``TAS'' (under the old process) or deemed eligible to receive funding or authorization (under the revised
process) for any other program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A tribe that has not done so may establish that it has been federally recognized by simply stating in its grant or program
authorization application that it appears on the list of federally recognized tribes that the Secretary of the Interior
publishes periodically in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the tribe notifies EPA that it has been recognized but does not appear on this list because the list has not been updated,
EPA will seek to verify the fact of recognition with the Department of the Interior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A tribe that has not yet made its initial governmental showing can do so by certifying that it has a government carrying
out substantial governmental functions. A tribe will be able to make the required certification if it is currently
performing governmental functions to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of its population. Examples
of such functions include, but are not limited to, levying taxes, acquiring land by exercise of the power of eminent
domain, and exercising police power. Such examples should be included in a narrative statement supporting the certification,
(1) Describing the form of tribal government and the types of essential governmental functions currently performed,
and (2) identifying the legal authorities for performing those functions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tribal constitutions or codes). It should be relatively easy for tribes to meet this requirement without submitting
copies of specific documents unless requested to do so by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Case-by-Case Review of Jurisdiction and Capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A tribe may have jurisdiction over, and capability to carry out, certain activities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, protection of the quality of a particular lake for the Clean Lakes program under the Clean Water Act), but not others
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, waste management on a portion of the reservation far removed from any lakes). For this reason, EPA believes that the
Agency must make a specific determination that a tribe has adequate jurisdictional authority and administrative
and programmatic capability before it approves each tribal program. This will ensure that tribes meet the statutory
requirements Congress has established as prerequisites to tribal eligibility for each particular program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Simplified Jurisdictional Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The portion of the jurisdictional determination under which governments comment on tribal jurisdiction will be
substantially altered under this rule. These changes are outlined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For approvals of all Drinking Water regulatory programs and most Clean Water programs under existing regulations,
EPA will not authorize a state to operate a program without determining that the state has adequate authority to carry
out those actions required to run the program. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 CFR 142.10 (PWS), 145.24 (UIC). This applies also to a tribe seeking program approval, and ensures that a close analysis
of the legal basis of a tribe's jurisdiction will occur before program authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, a separate ``TAS'' jurisdictional review is not needed to verify that a tribe meets the statutory jurisdictional
requirement, and is therefore proposed to be eliminated for all programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and for
the Clean Water Act's 404 and NPDES programs. This change would have the effect only of eliminating duplicative requirements.
In no case can a tribe receive program approval until the Agency has received full and adequate input concerning the
scope and extent of the tribe's jurisdiction. Moreover, EPA would expect each tribe seeking program approval to provide
a precise description of the physical extent and boundaries of the area for which it seeks regulatory authority. This
description should ordinarily include a map and should identify the sources or systems to be regulated by the tribe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for the Water Quality Standards program, there is no review of tribal civil regulatory authority as part
of the standards approval process under section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act. Accordingly, for that program, a comment
process would be retained. However, the Agency wishes to clarify the operation of that process by reiterating that
comments must be offered in a timely manner, and, further, by specifying that where no timely comments are offered,
the Agency will conclude that there is no objection to the tribal applicant's jurisdictional assertion. Moreover,
to raise a competing or conflicting claim a comment must clearly explain the substance, basis, and extent of its objections.
Finally, when questions are raised concerning a tribe's jurisdiction, EPA may, in its discretion, seek additional
information from the tribe or the commenting party, and may consult as it sees fit with other federal agencies prior
to making a determination as to tribal jurisdictional authority, but is not required to do so. Henceforth, EPA would/will
no longer be required, by regulation, to consult with the Department of the Interior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Agency notes that certain disputes concerning tribal jurisdiction may be relevant to a tribe's authority
to conduct activities and obtain program approval under several environmental statutes. For example, if a tribe
and a state or another tribe disagree as to the boundary of a particular tribe's reservation, each time the tribe seeks
to assert authority over the disputed area, the dispute will recur. The Agency recognizes that its determinations
regarding tribal jurisdiction apply only to activities within the scope of EPA programs. However, it also believes
that, once it makes a jurisdictional determination in response to a tribal application regarding any EPA program,
it will ordinarily make the same determination for other programs unless a subsequent application raises different
legal issues. Thus, for example, once the Agency has arrived at a position concerning a boundary dispute, it will not
alter that position in the absence of significant new factual or legal information. By contrast, however, a determination
that a tribe has inherent jurisdiction to regulate activities in one medium might not conclusively establish its
jurisdiction over activities in another medium. See generally Discussion of inherent tribal authority in Water
Quality Standards Regulation, 56 FR 64877&hyph;64879. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new approval process, as under the old, the Agency will continue to retain authority to limit its approval
of a tribal application to those land areas where the tribe has demonstrated jurisdiction. This would allow EPA to
approve the portion of a tribal application covering certain areas, while withholding approval of the portion of
an application addressing those land areas where tribal authority has not been satisfactorily established. See,

2. Capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA must continue to make a separate determination of tribal capability for each program for which it approves a tribe.
However, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Quality Standards, section 404, and NPDES regulations would be amended
to conform to the CWA grant regulations, which do not specifically prescribe the material a tribe must submit to establish
capability. Ordinarily, the inquiry EPA will make into the capability of any applicant, tribal or state, for a grant
or program approval would be sufficient to enable the Agency to determine whether a tribe meets the statutory capability
requirement. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 40 CFR part 31 (grant regulations applicable to states and tribes); 40 CFR 142.3 (Public Water System primary enforcement
responsibility requirements at parts 141, 142 apply to tribes); 145.1(h) (Underground Injection Control requirements
of parts 124, 144, 145, and 146 that apply to states generally apply to tribes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, EPA may request that the tribe provide a narrative statement or other documents showing that the tribe
is capable of administering the program for which it is seeking approval. In evaluating tribal capability, EPA will
consider: (1) The tribe's previous management experience; (2) existing environmental or public health programs
administered by the tribe; (3) the mechanisms in place for carrying out the executive, legislative and judicial functions
of the tribal government; (4) the relationship between regulated entities and the administrative agency of the tribal
government which will be the regulator; and (5) the technical and administrative capabilities of the staff to administer
and manage the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that certain tribes may not have substantial experience administering environmental programs;
a lack of such experience will not preclude a tribe from demonstrating capability, so long as it shows that it has the
necessary management and technical and related skills or submits a plan describing how it will acquire those skills.

IV. Summary of Revised Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the new process, tribes will continue to seek program approvals under the authority of statutes authorizing
EPA to treat eligible tribes in a manner similar to that in which it treats states. For instance, tribes seeking approval
of an NPDES or Wetlands permits program will comply with the applicable provisions of 40 CFR parts 123 or 233. However,
tribes will now generally be required to submit only a single application to demonstrate eligibility for the program
approval, without the need for a separate application for ``TAS.'' EPA will verify that the tribe meets all statutory
prerequisites for eligibility in the process of reviewing the single tribal application.

Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely revises existing procedural requirements for
Indian tribes by making them simpler and less burdensome; Indian tribes are not considered small entities under this
rulemaking for RFA purposes.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to require that manufacturers, importers, and distributors
report promptly to FDA any corrections or removals of a device undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device
or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) caused by the device which may present
a risk to health. Manufacturers, distributors, and importers would not have to report actions taken to improve the
performance or quality of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation
of the act caused by the device. Nor would manufacturers, distributors, and importers have to report actions defined
as routine servicing. FDA believes that the proposed reporting requirements are necessary to protect the public
health by assuring that the agency has current and complete information regarding those actions taken to eliminate
risk to health caused by devices. Reports of such actions will improve the agency's ability to evaluate device-related
problems and to take prompt action against potentially dangerous devices.

I. Statutory Authority and Legislative History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulatory framework for medical devices is the result of four statutes: (1) The act (21 U.S.C. 321&hyph;394),
(2) the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) (the 1976 amendments), (3) the SMDA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629),
and (4) the Medical Device Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;300) (the 1992 amendments).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act prohibited the marketing of adulterated or misbranded devices. The 1976 amendments amended the act with new
authority expressly designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1976 amendments gave FDA, for the first time, premarket controls over medical devices (e.g., classification,
premarket notification, and premarket approval). Additionally, the 1976 amendments strengthened the act's postmarket
controls relating to medical devices, giving FDA the authority to require patient notification; repair, replacement,
or refund; reporting and recordkeeping; current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's); and restrictions on the
distribution of certain devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SMDA, by streamlining in some places and augmenting authority in others, refines the premarket and postmarket
controls relating to medical devices added to the act by the 1976 amendments. Among the provisions of the SMDA that
augment postmarket controls is the reports and records of corrections and removals requirement of section 519(f)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i(f)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 519(f) of the act directs FDA to promulgate regulations requiring reporting and recordkeeping of correction
and removal actions taken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers. Under section 519(f)(1) of the
act, device manufacturers, distributors, and importers are to report promptly to FDA any correction or removal of
a device undertaken: (1) To reduce a risk to health posed by the device; or (2) to remedy a violation of the act caused
by a device which may present a risk to health. Section 519(f)(1) of the act also requires manufacturers, distributors,
and importers to keep records of those corrections and removals that are not required to be reported to FDA. Section
519(f)(2) of the act provides that no report of a correction or removal action under section 519(f)(1) of the act may
be required if a report of the correction or removal action is required and has been submitted to FDA under section 519(a)
of the act. Section 519(f)(3) of the act states that the terms ``correction'' and ``removal'' do not include routine
servicing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 519(f) of the act was enacted because Congress was concerned that device manufacturers, distributors, and
importers were carrying out product corrections or removals without notifying FDA, or not notifying the agency in
a timely fashion. (H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 29 (1990); S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)). Industry's
failure to report corrections and removals, particularly those undertaken to reduce risks associated with the use
of a device, Congress explained, ``denies the agency the opportunity to fulfill its public health responsibilities
by evaluating device-related problems and the adequacy of corrective actions,'' (S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess.
23 (1990)), and ``has seriously interfered with the FDA's ability to take prompt action against potentially dangerous
devices,'' (H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 29 (1990)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, Congress did not want to overburden industry or FDA with overreporting requirements. The reporting
requirements thus apply only to the ``more important postmarket actions, excluding those events already reported
to the [agency].'' However, to ensure that FDA has access to all relevant information on corrections or removals,
for those corrections and removals that need not be reported, Congress provided that records be maintained. (S. Rept.
513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) authorizes FDA to promulgate substantive binding regulations for the
efficient enforcement of the act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 704(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)) provides that for purposes of enforcement of the act, any duly designated
FDA employee is authorized, among other things: (1) To enter, at reasonable times, any factory, warehouse, or establishment
in which devices are manufactured, processed, packed, or held, or to enter any vehicle being used to transport or hold
devices, and (2) to inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, such factory,
warehouse, establishments, or containers, and labeling therein. Section 704(e) of the act requires that any person
required under section 519 of the act to maintain records and every person who is in charge or custody of such records
must, upon request of an officer or employee designated by FDA, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times
to have access to, and copy and verify, such record.

II. Scope of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations implementing the provisions of section 519(f) of the act will be set out in new 21 CFR part
806. Proposed &sect;806.1(a) provides generally that device manufacturers, distributors, and importers are required
to report promptly to FDA certain actions concerning device corrections and removals, and to maintain records of
all corrections and removals regardless of whether such corrections and removals are required to be reported to FDA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;806.1(b) describes the actions that are not subject to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements
of the regulation (set out at proposed &sect;806.10). Those actions are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Actions undertaken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to improve the performance or quality
of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the act caused
by the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Routine servicing as defined in proposed &sect;806.2(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Actions similar to item 1, undertaken by manufacturers of general purpose articles, such as chemical reagents
or laboratory equipment, whose uses are generally known by persons trained in their use and which are not labeled or
promoted or otherwise intended for medical uses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Who Must Report and When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;806.10(a) requires device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to submit a written report
to FDA of any correction or removal of a device undertaken: (1) To reduce a risk to health posed by the device; or (2) to
remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. Only one report is required for
each reportable event. The person initiating the action to correct or remove a device is required to report. In the
case of a foreign manufacturer or distributor, the U.S. designated agent is required to report. If the distributor
or importer corrects or removes a product on its own, then the distributor or importer is required to report the action.
Regardless of who submits the report or to which FDA district office the report is submitted, the name and location
of the manufacturer must be reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Time and Place for Submission of Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;806.10(b), device manufacturers, distributors, and importers must submit required correction
or removal reports within 10 calendar days of initiating a device correction or removal to the appropriate FDA district
office listed in &sect;5.115 (21 CFR 5.115) for their location and region. If the device is manufactured at multiple
manufacturing sites, the report must be submitted to the FDA district office where the device is finally assembled
and/or packaged. A foreign manufacturer or distributor that ships devices to the United States shall submit its own
reports of corrective or removal actions through the U.S. designated agent on its behalf. The U.S. designated agent
shall submit such reports to the FDA district office in which the agent's office is located.

C. What to Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;806.10(c), device manufacturers, distributors, and importers must include the following
information in the report: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Marketing status of the device, i.e., any applicable premarket notification number, premarket approval number,
or indicate if a preamendments device, and the device listing number. (A manufacturer or distributor that does not
have an FDA establishment registration number must indicate in the report whether it has ever registered with FDA).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The correction or removal report number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The model, catalog, or code number of the device and the manufacturing lot or serial number of the device or other

6. The manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and contact person if different from that of the person submitting
the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A complete description of the event(s) giving rise to the information reported and the corrective or removal actions
that have been, and are expected to be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Any illnesses or injuries that have occurred with use of the device. If applicable, include the medical device report
numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The total number of devices manufactured or distributed and the number in the same batch, lot, or equivalent unit
of production subject to the correction or removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The date of manufacture or distribution and the device's expiration date if applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all domestic and foreign consignees of the device and the dates
and number of devices distributed to each such consignee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. A copy of all communications regarding the correction or removal, and the names and addresses of all recipients
of the communications if the number of recipients of the communications is different than number 11 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is using the opportunity under this proposed rule to solicit comments regarding whether it would be desirable
to develop a form to collect reports of removal and correction data. Interested persons should submit written comments
to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). FDA will consider any comments received and will address the development
and use of a form to collect reports of correction and removal data in any final rule that is published.

D. FDA Review of Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA will review any correction or removal report submitted under proposed &sect;806.10 and where the correction
or removal involves: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Some, but not all, of the devices of a particular lot, model, code, etc., FDA will determine whether the action should
be extended to other units of the same device, other products of the same manufacturer or distributor, or to similar
products of other manufacturers or distributors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All of the devices of a particular lot, model, code, etc., FDA will classify the action as either one of the following:
(a) Recall, if the action was undertaken to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk
to health; or (b) safety alert, if the action was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device and not to remedy
a violation of the act caused by the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Records of Corrections and Removals Not Required To Be Reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;806.20(a) would require manufacturers, distributors, and importers who undertake a correction
or removal of a device that is not required to be reported to FDA under proposed &sect;806.10 to keep a record of such
correction or removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;806.20(b), records of corrections and removals not required to be reported to FDA under proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;806.10 must contain the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The brand name, common or usual name, classification name and product code if known, and the intended use of the device.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The model, catalog, or code number of the device and the manufacturing lot or serial number of the device or other
identification number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A complete description of the event giving rise to the information reported and the corrective or removal action
that has been, and is expected to be, taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Justification for not reporting the correction or removal action to FDA shall contain conclusions, any followups,
and be reviewed and evaluated by a designated person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A copy of all communications regarding the correction or removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;806.20(c), manufacturers, distributors, and importers must retain all records required
under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;806.20 for a period of 2 years beyond the expected life of the device, even if the manufacturer or distributor
has ceased to manufacture or distribute the device. Records required to be maintained under &sect;806.20(c) must
be transferred to the new owner of the device and maintained for the required period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. FDA Access to Records and Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;806.30, manufacturers, distributors, and importers required to maintain records concerning
corrections or removals and every person who is in charge or custody of such records must, upon request of an officer
or employee designated by FDA and pursuant to section 704(e) of the act, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable
times to have access to, and to copy and verify, such records and reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Public Availability of Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;806.40 makes clear that any device correction or removal report submitted to FDA is available for
public disclosure in accordance with the agency's public information regulations at part 20 (21 CFR part 20). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before public disclosure of a report, FDA will delete the following from the report in accordance with part 20: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any information that constitutes trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information under &sect;20.61;
and (2) any personnel, medical, and similar information, including the serial numbers of implanted devices, which
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under &sect;20.63; provided, that except for
the information under &sect;20.61, FDA will disclose to a patient who requests a report all the information in the
report concerning that patient.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301 of the act (21 U.S.C. 331) sets forth prohibited acts. Persons who violate section 301 of the act may be restrained,
under section 302 of the act (21 U.S.C. 332), or may be imprisoned or fined under section 303 of the act (21 U.S.C. 333).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Violations of any final rule based on this proposed rule, which is issued under the authority of sections 502, 510,
519, 520, 701, and 704 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352, 360, 360i, 360j, 371, and 374), will result in committing one or more
of the following violations of section 301 of the act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Section 301(e) of the act, which prohibits, among other things, the failure to establish or maintain any record,
or make any report, required under section 519 of the act or the refusal to permit officers or employees designated
by FDA to have access to or verification or copying of any such required record.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 301(f) of the act prohibits the refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704 of the
act. Section 704(e) of the act requires every person required under section 519 of the act to maintain records and every
person who is in charge or custody of such records, upon request of an officer or employee designated by FDA, to permit
such officer or employee to have access to, and copy and verify, such records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 301(q) of the act prohibits, among other things, the failure or refusal to furnish any material or information
required by or under section 519 of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 502(t)(2) of the act deems a device to be misbranded if there is a failure or refusal to furnish
any material or information required by or under section 519 of the act respecting the device. Sections 301 (a), (b),
(c), (g), and (k) of the act prohibit several actions with respect to interstate commerce in misbranded devices. FDA
may also seize misbranded devices under section 304 of the act (21 U.S.C. 334) as well as restrain or prosecute violations
of section 301 of the act relating to misbranded devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms described above, the SMDA added section 303(f) to the
act, which provides for the first time that any person who fails to demonstrate substantial compliance with section
519(f) of the act may be subject to civil penalties. These penalties do not apply to any person who commits minor violations
of section 519(f) (only with respect to correction reports) if such person demonstrates substantial compliance
with section 519(f). A civil penalty may not exceed $15,000 for a single violation, and may not exceed $1,000,000 for
all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding.

VIII. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has carefully examined the costs and benefits of this proposed rule in accordance with the requirements of Executive
Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The agency concludes that this proposed rule
is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that the
proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The agency estimates that it will receive no more than 800 reports per year from
device manufacturers regarding removals and corrections. For the estimated 800 reports the total cost would be $240,000.
In addition, the agency expects that there will be other instances of corrections and removals that will not have to
be reported to the agency, but will have to be maintained in files at the manufacturer's site. These records are to be
made available to FDA inspectors upon request. The cost of preparing these records would be $120,000 per year. An assessment
of the economic impact of any final rule based on this proposal has been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(address above) and may be seen by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is proposing to implement provisions of the SMDA that require a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a device
to report promptly to FDA any correction or removal of a device undertaken by a manufacturer, importer, or distributor
of a device if the correction or removal was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation
of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. The purpose of the proposed changes is to improve the
protection of the public health by assuring that FDA has current and complete information regarding those actions
taken to eliminate any risk to health caused by the device.

(a) The regulations in this part implement section 519(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) which
requires device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to report promptly to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) certain actions concerning device corrections and removals, and to maintain records of all corrections and
removals regardless of whether such corrections and removals are required to be reported to FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The following actions are exempt from the reporting requirements of this part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Actions undertaken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers to improve the performance or quality
of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the act caused
by the device.

(2) Routine servicing as defined in &sect;806.2(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Actions similar to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, undertaken by manufacturers of general purpose articles,
such as chemical reagents or laboratory equipment whose uses are generally known by persons trained in their use and
which are not labeled or promoted or otherwise intended for medical use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The failure of a manufacturer, distributor, or importer or any person to comply with any applicable requirement
of this part renders the device misbranded within the meaning of section 502(t) of the act and further constitutes
a prohibited act within the meaning of section 301(q)(1)(B) of the act.
