SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given of a mail referendum on the designation of a consolidated auction market at Windsor, Williamston,
and Robersonville, North Carolina. Williamston and Robersonville, North Carolina, were separately designated
on August 16, 1941, and Windsor on June 16, 1950, (7 CFR 29.8001) as flue-cured tobacco auction markets under the Tobacco
Inspection Act (7 U.S.C. 511 et seq.). Under this Act the three markets have been receiving mandatory grading services
from USDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 14, 1993, an application was made to the Secretary of Agriculture to consolidate the designated markets
of Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville, North Carolina. The application, filed by warehouse operators in those
markets, was made pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 CFR part 29.1&hyph;29.3).
On November 9, 1993, a public hearing was held in Williamston, North Carolina, pursuant to the regulations. A Review
Committee, established pursuant to &sect;29.3(h) of the regulations (7 CFR 29.3(h)), has reviewed and considered
the application, the testimony presented at the hearing, the exhibits received in evidence, and other available
information. The Committee recommended to the Secretary that the application be granted and the Secretary approved
the application on March 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before a new market can be officially designated, a referendum must be held to determine that a two-thirds majority
of producers favor the designation. It is hereby determined that the referendum will be held by mail during the period
of April 4 through April 8, 1994. The purpose of the referendum is to determine whether farmers who sold their tobacco
on the designated markets at Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville are in favor of, or opposed to, the designation
of the consolidated market for the 1994 and succeeding crop years. Accordingly, if a two-thirds majority of those
tobacco producers voting in the referendum favor this consolidation, a new market will be designated as and be called
Windsor-Williamston-Robersonville. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to vote in the referendum a tobacco producer must have sold flue-cured tobacco on either the Windsor,
Williamston, or Robersonville, North Carolina, auction markets during the 1993 marketing season. Any farmer who
believes he or she is eligible to vote in the referendum but has not received a mail ballot by April 4, 1994, should immediately
contact Larry L. Crabtree at (202) 205&hyph;0235. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referendum will be held in accordance with the provisions for referenda of the Tobacco Inspection Act, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 511d) and the regulations for such referendum set forth in 7 CFR 29.74.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed
Model 382 series airplanes. This proposal would require a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual to require takeoff
operation in accordance with revised performance data. This proposal is prompted by a report of a change that had been
incorporated into the propeller governor of these airplanes during production, which altered the thrust decay characteristic
of the propeller when operating in an engine failure scenario. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to ensure that the airplane is operated at sufficient speeds to mitigate the problems associated with a faster thrust
decay and to prevent the airplane from departing the side of the runway.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During recent flight testing of a Lockheed Model 382 series airplane, the airplane could not meet the ground minimum
control speed (V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) schedule as specified in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Investigation revealed that, during production,
a change had been incorporated into the propeller governor, which altered the thrust decay characteristic of the
propeller when operating in an engine failure scenario. This altered characteristic was such that the actual V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 values were increased by as much as 15 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) over the values specified in the AFM. This condition
poses a potential hazard in those situations where an airplane is operated in a high thrust-to-weight condition and
the takeoff decision speed (V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is equal to or very near V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: If the airplane were to experience a critical engine failure at, or very near, the currently published V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 speed, and the flight crew elected to continue the takeoff, the faster thrust decay (and, hence, an increasing V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) could cause the airplane to swerve more than the 25-foot limit permitted by Civil Aeronautics Regulation 4b (under
which the Model 382 was certificated). This condition, if not corrected, could lead to the airplane departing the
side of the runway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lockheed Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes that are equipped with a servo-type valve housing assembly, having
part number 714325&hyph;2, &hyph;3, &hyph;5, &hyph;6, or &hyph;7 installed on any outboard engine, have been determined
to be subject to this unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Supplement 382&hyph;16, dated August 11,
1993, that provides revised performance data to address the increase in V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It also provides procedures to permit changing the power setting of the outboard engines, in order to partially mitigate
the payload penalty associated with the increased V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This AFM supplement is intended to be interim action until a design change in the propeller governor is developed
to address the V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mcg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist on other products of this same type design, the
proposed AD would require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to require takeoff operation of the airplane in accordance
with the revised performance data contained in the AFM supplement described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may propose further
rulemaking.. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 112 Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.
The FAA estimates that 18 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed AFM change, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $55 per
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 427), FDA issued a proposed rule to amend the food labeling regulations to establish Reference
Daily Intakes (RDI's) for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum for use
in declaring the nutrient content of a food on its label or labeling; to change the units of measure for biotin, folate,
calcium, and phosphorus; and to make consideration of selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium optional when
determining nutritional inferiority. Because of an inadvertent error, the proposed rule specified two dates for
the close of the comment period. On page 427, in the ``DATES'' section of the document, FDA listed March 7, 1994, as the
close of the comment period. On page 431, in the ``COMMENTS'' section, however, the document incorrectly stated that
July 7, 1994, would be the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency's intent was to give the normal 60 days for comment; that is, to close the comment period on March 7, 1994.
However, because of this error, the agency's intent was obviously obscured. As a result, there may be interested persons
who have not yet sent in their comments even though March 7, 1994 has passed. Therefore, to ensure that all interested
parties have an opportunity to comment, FDA is reopening the comment period for an additional 30 days. Comments must
be received no later than April 25, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is conducting a port access route study to evaluate the need for changes to the vessel routing measures
in the approaches to Delaware Bay. Due to a number of near collisions, and at least one collision between an outbound
tug-barge and an inbound deep draft ship, the Mariner's Advisory Committee of the Bay and River Delaware has requested
that the eastern approach lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) be adjusted and that an inshore traffic zone
be established for coastwise traffic. This port access route study will determine what, if any, changes to the vessel
routing measures are needed in the approaches to Delaware Bay. As a result of the study, a new or modified TSS may be proposed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 1978 amendments to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), require that a port access route
study be conducted prior to establishing or adjusting a traffic separation scheme (TSS). The Coast Guard is undertaking
a port access route study to determine the effect of amending the TSS on vessel traffic safety in the study area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A TSS is an internationally recognized routing measure that minimizes the risk of collision by separating vessels
into opposing streams of traffic through the establishment of traffic lanes. Vessel use of a TSS is voluntary; however,
vessels operating in or near an International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved TSS are subject to Rule 10 of the
International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TSS in the Approaches to Delaware Bay was last studied in 1981, and the results were published on October 5, 1981,
(46 FR 49035). The study concluded that the existing TSS was adequate for the foreseeable future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Coast Guard initiated Waterways Analysis and Management System Study (WAMS) of the Delaware Bay Approach, conducted
in 1990, recommended reorientation of the eastern approach TSS to the south. WAMS was developed to serve as the basis
for a systematic analysis and management of the aids to navigation in our nation's waterways. WAMS is intended to identify
the navigational needs of the users of a particular waterway, the present adequacy of the aids system in terms of those
needs, and what is required in those cases where the users' needs are not being met. The WAMS process also looks into
the resources_physical, financial, and personnel_needed to carry out the Aids to Navigation program responsibilities.
The analyses of each waterway and the attendant resources are then integrated to provide documentation for both day
to day management and future planning within the Aids to Navigation program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of safety concerns, the Mariners Advisory Committee for the Bay and River Delaware has also requested that
the eastern approach lanes of the TSS be adjusted and that an inshore traffic zone be established for coastwise traffic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Delaware River Comprehensive Navigation Study, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also conducting
a study to consider construction of a Midstream Deepwater Port to provide deep draft crude oil carriers improved access
for lightering operations in Anchorage A (off the entrance to the Mispillion River), 33 CFR 110.157, southwest of
Brandywine Channel. If the Army Corps of Engineers determines there is a need for a Midstream Deepwater Port, a one-way
access channel leading from the ocean to Anchorage A, in the vicinity of the current Southeastern Approach, may be
designed to facilitate the safe movement of deep draft crude oil carriers to Anchorage A for lightering operations,
and to encourage the use of larger and more efficient transport vessels to Delaware River ports. This channel would
then lead through the Pilot Area near Cape Henlopen to Anchorage A, with the deepening of the lower (southeastern)
corner of the anchorage. Incorporation of this study with the Army Corps of Engineers study is intended to identify
those items of mutual concern and to blend channel deepening requirements into vessel traffic management requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the Mariners' Advisory Committee for the Bay and River Delaware, four lighted buoys will be relocated
within the Precautionary Area during the week of April 25, 1994. Relocation of these buoys will shift the pilot area
one half nautical mile to the southeast and Delaware Bay Approach LB 4 one half nautical mile to the southwest. This
will allow more sea room for tug and tow traffic approaching from and departing along the New Jersey coast.

The study area encompasses the existing TSS which was adopted by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization
(as the International Maritime Organization was formerly known) on October 28, 1969. A change to the southeastern
approach lanes was implemented on March 15, 1976.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The study may recommend the following options:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Make no changes to the current traffic separation system in the Delaware Bay Approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Discontinue the entire Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the Delaware Bay Approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Adjust the Eastern Approach TSS by narrowing the separation zone to allow the establishment of an inshore traffic
zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Relocate the Southern Approach TSS, and include a deepwater route similar to the deepwater route in the Southern
Approach to Chesapeake Bay, i.e., the deepwater route centered between inbound and outbound lanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Adjust the Eastern Approach TSS by narrowing the separation zone to allow the establishment of an inshore traffic
zone and retain the current Southern Approach TSS with a midstream Deepwater Port on the eastern side of the inbound
traffic lane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Adjust the Eastern Approach TSS by narrowing the separation zone to allow the establishment of an inshore traffic
zone, and, relocate the Southern Approach TSS to include a deepwater route similar to the deepwater route in the Southern
Approach to Chesapeake Bay, i.e., the deepwater route centered between inbound and outbound lanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Abolish the Eastern Approach TSS and maintain the current Southern Approach TSS.

Procedural Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In order to provide safe access routes for movement of vessel traffic proceeding to and from U.S. ports, the PWSA directs
that the Secretary designate necessary fairways and traffic separation schemes in which the paramount right of navigation
over all other uses shall be recognized. Before a designation can be made, the Coast Guard is required to undertake
a study of potential traffic density and the need for safe access routes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the study, the Coast Guard is directed to consult with federal and state agencies and to consider the views of
representatives of the maritime community, port and harbor authorities or associations, environmental groups,
and other parties who may be affected by the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), the Coast Guard will, to the extent practicable, reconcile the need for safe
access routes with the needs of all other reasonable uses of the area involved. The Coast Guard will also consider previous
studies and experience in the areas of vessel traffic management, navigation, shiphandling, the effects of weather,
and prior analysis of the traffic density in certain regions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of this study will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the Coast Guard determines that new routing measures are needed, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published.
It is anticipated that the study will be concluded by 30 October 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Archives and Records Administration proposes to amend regulations on procedures for preserving and
protecting the Presidential historical materials of the Nixon administration and for providing public access to
these materials. The Archivist of the United States is required by law to issue these regulations, and may amend them
from time to time. The proposed regulatory amendments would clarify various terms that appear in 36 CFR part 1275;
clarify the nature of the archival processing being conducted on the Nixon Presidential materials; and provide for
the reproduction of the Nixon White House tape recordings. The proposed amendments to 36 CFR part 1275 would affect
former President Nixon and other individuals whose names appear in the materials, as well as members of the general
public interested in conducting research regarding those materials.

578 F. Supp. 951 (D.D.C. 1983); the case held that the previous regulations were tainted by the legislative veto provision
of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (``PRMPA''), 44 U.S.C. 2111 note (1974). The current
regulations were published on February 28, 1986, 51 FR 7228, and became effective on June 26, 1986. On April 12, 1988,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the District Court's approval of the regulations
promulgated by the Archivist on June 26, 1986.

to prepare the Nixon Presidential materials for public access. Nixon Presidential historical material falling
into several categories has been released since 1986. One category consists of selected subject categories and Staff
Member and Office Files from the Nixon White House Central Files, which has been released (subject to the withholding
of restricted material) in relatively small portions over time. Most of this material from the White House Central
Files documents the President's constitutional and statutory duties, and the release of that material has been largely
uneventful. 51 FR 32700 (Sept. 15, 1986), 53 FR 1870 (Jan. 22, 1988), 53 FR 40976 and 41441 (Oct. 19, 1988), 54 FR 24054
(June 5, 1989), 54 FR 43878 (Oct. 27, 1989), 56 FR 30774 (July 5, 1991), 57 FR 417 (Jan. 6, 1992), 57 FR 23602 (June 4, 1992),
58 FR 17433 (April 2, 1993), and 58 FR 31548 (June 3, 1993). In addition, the National Archives and Records Administration
has released the Nixon White House Photo Collection, 44 FR 57221 (Oct. 4, 1979); Nixon White House Communications
Agency Audio and Video Files, 51 FR 26782 (July 25, 1986); Nixon White House selected audiovisual materials, 53 FR
40976 (October 19, 1988); and Nixon Presidential historical materials relating to POW/MIA matters, 58 FR 52121 (Oct.
6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, a large series of materials known as the White House Special Files was released. 52 FR 3068 (Jan. 30, 1987).
That file consists of many thousands of pages of sensitive documents, a high percentage of which document abuses of
power. In addition to the withholding of material that the National Archives and Records Administration determined
to be subject to restriction under the current regulations, the National Archives and Records Administration withheld
material from the White House Special Files which it deemed releasable, but which former President Nixon claimed
was subject to restriction or that was private or personal and therefore returnable. These contested documents are
currently undergoing further review by the Presidential Materials Review Board in accordance with the provisions
of the current PRMPA regulations.

On June 4, 1991, the National Archives and Records Administration released a group of Nixon White House tape recordings.
The release consisted of approximately 60 hours of tape recordings previously subpoenaed by the Watergate Special
Prosecution Force (``WSPF'') during its investigations, as well as tape transcripts located among the records of
the WSPF. Approximately 121/2 hours of these tape recordings had previously been played in open court in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Archives and Records Administration decided that the best way to proceed with the release of the body
of the 4,000 hours of Nixon White House tape recordings was to release Watergate-related segments of the tape recordings
in small monthly groupings on an ongoing basis. The first of these releases was noticed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 2, 1993, 58 FR 17433, and took place on May 17, 1993, without any objections from affected parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second and third releases were noticed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 3, 1993, and July 2, 1993, to take place on July 15, 1993, and August 26, 1993, respectively. 58 FR 31548 (June
3, 1993); 58 FR 35983 (July 2, 1993). Former President Nixon raised certain procedural objections to these proposed
releases. When the National Archives and Records Administration rejected former President Nixon's contention
that those releases should not go forward, he sought relief in the courts. On August 9, 1993, Judge Royce Lamberth of
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order preliminarily enjoining the National
Archives and Records Administration from carrying out the releases of allegedly Watergate-related tape recordings
scheduled for August 13 and 26, 1993, pending (1) Segregation and return to former President Nixon of all private or
personal conversations on the tape recordings; and (2) processing of the tape recordings before release to the public
as a single ``integral file segment.'' The Court's ruling relied on the terms of the current PRMPA regulations, and
on the terms of a draft processing manual which the National Archives and Records Administration's Nixon Presidential
Materials Project (``Nixon Project'') has used in preparing Nixon Presidential materials for public disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several respects, which will be discussed in greater detail below, the current regulations and the Nixon Project
draft processing manual, especially as interpreted preliminarily by the court in the context of the preliminary
injunction, do not reflect what the National Archives and Records Administration has come to recognize as the most
appropriate fashion in which to process and release the Nixon White House tape recordings. Therefore, the National
Archives and Records Administration proposes certain amendments to the current regulations (which will have the
effect of altering the draft processing manual) to balance the National Archives and Records Administration's responsibility
to provide public access to the tape recordings, including those segments relating to Watergate, at the earliest
reasonable date, with the need to protect the rights of former President Nixon and other affected parties.

Section 1275.16(b) is amended to make clear that no physical portion of the original tape recordings shall constitute
private or personal material, and therefore no portion of those original recordings is to be returned to former President
Nixon or to any other affected party. The PRMPA requires the Archivist to maintain those original tape recordings,
whether or not they contain personal conversations; as a result, the amendment to &sect;1275.16(b) states that the
original tape recordings constitute Presidential historical materials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1275.16(e) clarifies the nomenclature used throughout the regulations and distinguishes between ``Archivist,''
defined as the Archivist of the United States or his or her designated agent, and ``archivist,'' as defined in the current
subsection, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an employee of the National Archives and Records Administration, who, by education or experience, is specially
trained in archival techniques.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.16(g) clarifies the definition of ``archival processing'' to ensure that nothing in the subsection
creates any obligation on the part of the Archivist to perform any one particular archival processing task listed
in the subsection. In so doing, the National Archives and Records Administration intends to make clear that transcripts
of the tape recordings need not be made. Although the current regulations indicate that the processing of the Nixon
White House materials may undergo one or more of several archival processing phases, including the preparation of
transcripts, the National Archives and Records Administration does not believe that the regulations intended to
obligate the processing archivists to transcribe all 4,000 hours of tape recordings before releasing them to the
public. Indeed, the National Archives and Records Administration has estimated that it would take an extraordinary
amount of staff time to accomplish such a task. In addition, the definition of ``archival processing'' in &sect;1275.16(g)
has been expanded to reflect the archival processing of the Nixon Presidential materials that actually has been taking
place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.20 is amended to be consistent with the amended definition of ``Archivist'' set forth in amended &sect;1275.16(e)
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.42(a) is amended to clarify the manner in which the National Archives and Records Administration intends
to proceed with the archival processing and release of the tape recordings and all other non-tape Nixon Presidential
materials. The current regulations provide that Nixon White House materials will be disclosed to the public in ``integral
file segments.'' The concept of integral file segment, although not defined anywhere in the current regulations,
is based on standard archival practice, and ordinarily refers to an archival determination that a particular group
of processed documents constitutes an intelligible and complete unit for purposes of historical research. Archival
determinations of integral file segments may vary significantly both in the quantity of inclusive materials and
in the qualitative factors used in determining the components of a particular file segment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 subject matter, author, time frame, etc.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nixon Project draft processing manual indicates that the National Archives and Records Administration intended
to process the entire 4,000 hours of tape recordings as one integral file segment. In support of his motion for a preliminary
injunction that was issued on August 9, 1993, former President Nixon argued that the draft processing manual, when
read in conjunction with the current regulations, prohibits the National Archives and Records Administration from
releasing any portion of the tape recordings before the remaining body of the non-restricted tape recordings (other
than the approximately 60 hours of WSPF tape segments previously released) is processed and released. Former President
Nixon's position is not supported by the realities of processing the materials for public access nor, aside from the
provisions of the current regulations and draft processing manual hereby proposed for amendment, supported legally,
since it is contrary to other statutory and regulatory obligations of the National Archives and Records Administration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, waiting until all 4,000 hours of tape have been reviewed and prepared for release would seriously undermine
the statutory and regulatory obligation of the National Archives and Records Administration to give the public access
to Watergate-related material at the earliest reasonable date. Second, releasing or restricting all 4,000 hours
at once would be inconsistent with current &sect;1275.42(b), which requires the National Archives and Records Administration
to publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of a proposed opening of materials. The purpose of that notice is to allow interested parties the opportunity
to review_and object as appropriate_to those materials which are being proposed for opening. Under current &sect;1275.44(a),
anyone who wishes to object to a proposed opening must do so within thirty (30) days of the notice. In light of the fact
that the collection of tape recordings consists of some 4,000 hours (minus copies of approximately 775 hours of tape
segments previously identified as private or personal or room noise and offered for return to former President Nixon),
it would be impossible for any one individual to review all portions of the tape recordings proposed for opening within
the allotted thirty-day period if all of the unrestricted tape recordings were to be opened at the same time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these concerns, the proposed amendments to &sect;1275.42(a) would allow the release of the tape recordings
in groupings which would permit the opening of reasonable portions of the tape recordings without the need for all
4,000 hours to be released at once.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, amended &sect;1275.42(a) provides that the Archivist is free to release segments of the tape recordings
that are not private or personal prior to transferring private or personal material in accordance with current &sect;1275.48.
This amendment would allow the National Archives and Records Administration to continue processing and opening
Watergate-related segments of the tape recordings at the earliest reasonable date, in accordance with its statutory
and regulatory responsibility, before all private or personal conversations are culled out of copies of the remaining
parts of the tape recordings and returned to former President Nixon or other affected parties. Given that the release
of non-private conversations would not violate an individual's right to keep private conversations confidential,
this amendment is entirely appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1275.46(d) and 1275.46(f) are amended to be consistent with the amended definition of ``Archivist'' set
forth in amended &sect;1275.16(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.48(a) is amended to be consistent with the amendment to &sect;1275.16(b), to make clear that no portion
of the original tape recordings is to be returned to former President Nixon or to any other affected party. The PRMPA
requires the Archivist to maintain those original tape recordings, whether or not they contain private or personal
conversations. The amendment to this subsection would eliminate any doubt that the Archivist is to retain the original
tape recordings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.64 is amended to include a provision allowing for the reproduction of tape recordings opened to the public.
This amendment is fully consistent with the practice of the National Archives and Records Administration with regard
to other tape recordings. The issue of whether to provide copies of tape recordings has been considered by the National
Archives and Records Administration on several occasions. At the time the current regulations were being written,
the National Archives and Records Administration decided to maintain its prior position of not allowing copies of
tape recordings, although it specifically stated that this position would be reviewed periodically. 51 FR 7228 (Feb.
28, 1986). After careful reconsideration of its position, the National Archives and Records Administration has
decided to allow the copying of released tape recordings. In so doing, the National Archives and Records Administration
relies on the guidance from the Supreme Court in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 435 U.S. 589, 606&hyph;08 (1978), wherein the Supreme Court recognized the prerogative of the National Archives
and Records Service (the predecessor to the National Archives and Records Administration) to consider providing
the public with an opportunity to obtain such copies. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Warner Communications,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and because such copying would seem to be in the public interest generally as well as in keeping with the spirit of the
PRMPA, the National Archives and Records Administration is amending the regulations to allow for such copying.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.64(b) is also amended to be consistent with the nomenclature distinction between ``Archivist'' and
``archivist'' as set forth in &sect;1275.16(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1275.66(a) is amended to accommodate two different possibilities with respect to the reproduction of released
Nixon materials other than tape recordings: Copying by researchers on self-service government copiers; and copying
by contract vendors at the request of the National Archives and Records Administration. This change reflects not
only current practice at the Nixon Project, but common practice at other presidential libraries within the National
Archives and Records Administration system as well as NARA regulations regarding copying of archival documents.

refoldering and reboxing the documents and affixing labels; producing finding aids such as folder title lists, cross-indexes,
subject lists, scope and content notes, biographical data, and series descriptions; rewinding, duplicating and
preserving the original tape recordings; enhancing the tape recordings on which the conversations are wholly or
partially unintelligible so that extraneous noises may be filtered out; producing general subject matter logs of
the tape recordings; reproducing and transcribing tape recordings; reviewing the materials to identify items that
appear subject to restriction; identifying items in poor physical condition and assuring their preservation; identifying
materials requiring further processing; and preparation for public access of all materials which are not subject
to restriction.

(2) The archivists will conduct archival processing of the tape recordings to prepare them for public access in accordance
with the provisions set forth in this section. In conducting the archival processing of the tape recordings, the archivists
will restrict those segments of the tape recordings pursuant to &sect;&sect;1275.50 and 1275.52, and will segregate
additional private or personal materials for transfer in accordance with &sect;1275.48. The tape segments which
consist of Watergate materials, as defined in &sect;1275.16(c), will be given priority processing by the archivists
and will be prepared for public access and released as the Archivist determines to be appropriate. After the tape segments
which consist of abuse of power materials have been released, the archivists will conduct archival processing of
the remainder of the tape recordings in reasonable chronological segments beginning with February 1971 and ending
with July 1973. The remaining tape segments will be prepared for public access and released as the Archivist determines
to be appropriate. Nothing in this subsection prohibits the Archivist from preparing for public access and releasing
segments of the tape recordings prior to transferring private or personal materials pursuant to &sect;1275.48.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is proposing rules that establish equipment standards, performance standards, and procedures for
security against acts of terrorism on certain passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals. Passenger
vessels over 100 gross tons carrying more than 12 passengers on voyages of over 24 hours on the high seas will be affected.
These rules are necessary because lack of voluntary compliance with measures of the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) published in 1986, or with these measures published as Coast Guard ``guidelines'' in 1987, requires mandatory
compliance to attain ``effective security measures.''

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vulnerability to terrorism of passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals has been a major national
and international concern since the death of a citizen of the United States (U.S.) during the hijacking of the Achille
Lauro in 1985. To address this threat, the President signed into law the ``Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism
Act'' in 1986. That act amended the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, providing the Coast Guard authority to ``carry
out or require measures, including inspections, port and harbor patrols, the establishment of security and safety
zones, and the development of contingency plans and procedures, to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IMO adopted and published ``Measures to Prevent Unlawful Acts Against Passengers and Crews on Board Ships'',
also in 1986. Those measures, which are guidelines, apply to passenger ships engaged on international voyages of
24 hours or more and to the port facilities that serve them. The Coast Guard published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 listing these measures as ``guidelines'' and encouraging voluntary compliance [52 FR 11587, (April 9, 1987)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the U.S., the Coast Guard has relied upon voluntary compliance with the IMO's measures and with its own guidelines
based on them. Coast Guard encouragement to implement these guidelines has brought about varying degrees of acceptance.
The initial response was promising, as many passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals operating in the
U.S. began implementing these measures. However, most of those vessels and terminals implemented the measures only
partly. Many of them cited cost as the main reason for not implementing the measures fully. Progress toward implementation
of the measures has slowed significantly over the last three years. Some passenger vessels and passenger terminals
still do not maintain and administer appropriate security measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lack of voluntary compliance with the guidelines, on some passenger vessels and at some passenger terminals,
indicates that mandatory compliance with rules enforced by penalties is necessary to attain ``effective security
measures'' on passenger vessels making voyages on the high seas of 24 hours or more and at all passenger terminals associated
with those vessels. Consequently, the Coast Guard is proposing rules that will specify appropriate equipment standards,
performance standards, and procedures for security. The Coast Guard has modeled the proposed rules after the IMO's
measures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Coast Guard would implement standards for security on passenger vessels and at passenger terminals by adding
two parts to Chapter I of title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Part 120, ``Passenger Vessel Security'',
would go into Subchapter K, which would become ``Security of Vessels.'' Part 128, ``Passenger Terminal Security'',
would go into Subchapter L, which already governs ``Waterfront Facilities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proposed &sect;120.100 would limit the applicability of the rules for passenger vessels. Passenger vessels that
embark or disembark passengers in the U.S. fall under U.S. jurisdiction and are of interest since many of the passengers
involved are U.S. citizens. The rules proposed here concern vessels of over 100 gross tons carrying more than 12 passengers
for hire, making voyages any part of which is on the high seas, lasting 24 hours or more. Unlawful acts are likelier to
occur on longer voyages. A segmented voyage with multiple stops is considered a single voyage for determining applicability
under this rule. Passenger vessels commonly make voyages with port calls less than 24 hours apart although the passengers
return to the ship after each port call to continue their voyage, which lasts over 24 hours. Generally, vessels over
100 gross tons are over 65 feet long and carry more than 12 passengers. The Coast Guard considered other levels of gross
tonnage, but the number of vessels that would be affected by changing the threshold of gross tonnage did not justify
the variation in applicability between the safety and security regulations. Only 8 vessels under 1600 gross tons,
only 5 of which are under 500 gross tons, would be subject to these rules. The high seas was selected as a limitation to
applicability to passenger vessels because it is a well defined jurisdictional area. These limits accord with the
IMO's guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Proposed &sect;120.110 would clarify the meanings of terms used in Part 120. Most are identical to definitions
in other parts of Chapter I of Title 33. The term ``passenger terminal'' here includes waterfront facilities, as defined
in the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, that receive passenger vessels subject to this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proposed &sect;120.120 would incorporate standards of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for
X-ray screening systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Proposed &sect;120.130 would let the Commandant (G&hyph;MPS) approve alternative procedures that provide a
level of security equivalent to that provided by the rules proposed here. Alternative measures provide flexibility
to allow for situations where compliance is economically or physically impracticable. They also allow for the use
of better or cheaper equipment, performance, and procedures as these are developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Proposed &sect;120.200 would set out the performance standards for a security program on each covered passenger
vessel.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Proposed &sect;120.210 would require the designation of restricted areas on each covered passenger vessel where
access is limited to selected persons. Restricted areas would deter the introduction of prohibited persons, and
prohibited weapons, incendiaries, or explosives into sensitive areas where they could be used to hijack a vessel.
For each restricted area an intrusion detection system, with both local and remote alarms, would alert security personnel
to any illicit entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Proposed &sect;120.220 would require the designation of a ship security officer, who would be responsible for
managing day to day security on the vessel. Such designation is necessary to identify the person responsible for ensuring
that the security program is carried out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Proposed &sect;120.230 would require training, which is necessary to ensure that security personnel know how
to perform their duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Proposed &sect;120.240 would mandate coordination of security activities between the vessel and each passenger
terminal at which it calls. Such coordination is currently lacking. It would both eliminate duplication of efforts
and reduce the likelihood of gaps in the security system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Proposed &sect;120.250 would require reports of specified acts directed against the vessels or their passengers.
These reports are necessary to inform the Coast Guard and other law enforcement agencies of the extent of such acts
occurring so that they can allocate resources to deter or respond to similar acts in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Proposed &sect;&sect;120.300, 120.305, and 120.307 would require a ship security plan and specify procedures
for review and amendment of the plan. The ship security plan is the basic document that sets forth each vessel's strategy
for security. It includes a written description of the ship security program, which comprises the ship security survey,
the ship security bill, and various security procedures. This document provides a ready source of information for
security personnel and law enforcement agencies which may be called upon to respond to an incident. It also enables
the Coast Guard to evaluate the vessel's strategy for security. When the plan has been reviewed by the Coast Guard and
found to meet the requirements, a letter of adequacy is provided to the operator. Since the plan must be updated from
time to time, &sect;120.307 sets up the means for the operator to make amendments, either because of changed circumstances
or when directed to do so. A provision is included to allow the imposition of emergency measures by the Coast Guard.
No exemption from Freedom of Information Act disclosure requirements is currently provided for ship security plans.
Comments are solicited on whether these plans should be exempted from Freedom of Information Act disclosure to preserve
their confidentiality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Proposed &sect;&sect;120.310 and 120.320 would require a ship security survey that provides the information
necessary to develop the ship security plan. The procedures constituting the plan will depend upon the threats and
vulnerabilities identified in the survey. The survey must undergo periodic updates to reflect changes in threats
and vulnerability. The recent pace of changes in threats suggests that two years is the longest prudent interval between
updates. The survey also needs to be updated when new ports are visited or there are changes to the vessel that may affect
vessel security. An update is also required when there is a change in key vessel personnel because a change in these
personnel may influence vessel security.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Proposed &sect;120.330 would require a ship security bill that indicates the security duties and watch schedules
necessary to implement security procedures. This document not only informs members of the crew of their responsibilities
but enables review of the duties and schedules by law enforcement agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Proposed &sect;120.340 would require standard operating procedures relative to security (SSOPs) that set forth,
in writing, routine activities (and standardized responses to certain non-routine situations). These procedures
enable the operators of the vessels to train and inform security personnel. They also enable the Coast Guard to evaluate
the adequacy of those activities and responses. In order for security measures to be effective, and because the measures
must be tailored to the particular vessel and terminal, the rules do not contain detailed standards for the SSOPs.
The Coast Guard will provide guidelines for the SSOPs to vessel and terminal operators and the rules provide for individualized
consideration of SSOPs developed by vessel and terminal operators, including a process to resolve disagreements
as to their adequacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Proposed &sect;120.350 would require identification procedures for personnel boarding passenger vessels
and entering restricted areas on the vessels. These procedures are necessary to determine the eligibility of members
of the crew, passengers, visitors, vendors, and other personnel for boarding or entry. In general the procedures
provide for use of identification that bears a photograph of the person to verify the identity of the person seeking
access. Although alterations to such identification cards are possible, alterations are generally detectable
if the cards are properly laminated. Use of a voyage specific identification card bearing a photograph provides an
inexpensive and convenient means of ensuring that persons reboarding the vessel at intermediate port stops are,
in fact, passengers on that voyage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Proposed &sect;120.360 would tell how to conduct screening of persons and property boarding vessels or entering
restricted areas on vessels. Screening is necessary to ensure that prohibited weapons, incendiaries, and explosives
are not introduced onto the vessels or into restricted areas aboard them. Stricter screening is necessary for property
accessible to passengers than for articles accessible only to members of the crew. Only a certain percentage of these
articles such as ships' stores, would be required to undergo screening, or search. The fact that random screening
is taking place will deter the smuggling of prohibited weapons, incendiaries, or explosives while minimizing the
burden on vessel and terminal operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Proposed &sect;120.370 would require communication procedures to be established aboard each covered passenger
vessel. Communications are important for summoning assistance from other members of the crew, from the passenger
terminal, or from local law enforcement agencies in an actual or potential emergency. Distress signals are necessary
in case the primary means of communications is damaged or destroyed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Proposed &sect;120.400 would prohibit most carriage of weapons, incendiaries, and explosives on covered passenger
vessels. Certain law enforcement officials may carry firearms. Inaccessible baggage may contain weapons under
some circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Proposed &sect;120.410 would require lighting for security on covered passenger vessels during darkness. Lighting
has proved effective in deterring unauthorized entry into secured areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Proposed &sect;120.420 would require local and remote alarms for the intrusion detection systems aboard passenger
vessels required by &sect;120.210. Alarms are necessary to alert security personnel when intrusion occurs, because
these systems are generally monitored in areas remote from the restricted areas. Early response is critical to security,
and without alarms, intrusions could go unnoticed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. Proposed &sect;120.430 would specify screening systems to detect prohibited weapons, incendiaries, and explosives
before they could be carried aboard vessels. Those systems generally comprise X-ray machines, metal detectors,
and manual searches; they may include either dogs trained to detect explosives or explosives detecting machines.
The specifications for X-ray systems draw on standards of ASTM, which include, for existing technology, appropriate
settings and sensitivity of the systems' components. In order for these security measures to be effective, and because
the measures employed will vary for each vessel and terminal, detailed requirements other than the ASTM standard
for X-ray systems, if used, are not contained in the rules. Security measures developed by vessel and terminal operators
will be reviewed for adequacy and appropriateness for the particular vessel and terminal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. Proposed &sect;120.440 would set the requirements for testing and maintenance of security equipment. Unless
security equipment is appropriately maintained, failure is likelier; unless it is periodically tested or checked,
failure is likelier to go undetected for a long time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Proposed &sect;120.450 would require records of checks and maintenance of security equipment. Records are necessary
for the Coast Guard to verify that equipment is being cared for properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Proposed &sect;128.100 would limit the applicability of the rules for passenger terminals. Only those waterfront
facilities that serve passenger vessels subject to part 120 need satisfy these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. Proposed &sect;&sect;128.110 through 128.430 are analogous to proposed &sect;&sect;120.110 through 120.430
because the subjects are analogous. Section 128.210 excludes the boarding area for passengers from the requirement
of an intrusion detection system because the extent of the typical area makes such a system impracticable. Signs for
restricted areas on passenger terminals are only required in English. Comments are sought on the need to require signs
in other languages for restricted areas on U.S. passenger terminals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Proposed &sect;128.435 would specify security barriers. The ease of access to passenger terminals from surrounding
areas makes barriers necessary to deter unauthorized entry into terminals. General practices from industry helped
form the standards for the construction of security fences and walls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This proposal is not major under Executive Order 12291 but is considered significant under the Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures [44 FR 11040 (February 26, 1979)] because it is a high priority project within
the Coast Guard and involves important Departmental policy. A draft Regulatory Evaluation is available in the docket
for inspection or copying where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard anticipates that approximately 100 passenger vessels and 53 passenger terminals would be affected.
Of the passenger vessels, approximately 97 are cruise vessels carrying in excess of 100 passengers operating out
of U.S. ports. All of the terminals service these cruise vessels. There may be up to 40 vessels and 20 terminals that
would be subject to these rules only on an occasional basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial implementing costs are estimated to be $14 million, of which approximately $12 million would be for security
equipment. Annual operating costs are estimated to be $10 million.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
], the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under &sect;3 of the Small Business Act [15
U.S.C. 632].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking could have more than a minimal impact on a few small entities, but most passenger vessels making voyages
on the high seas of 24 hours or more, and most terminals associated with them, are neither owned nor operated by small
entities. Security requirements for small vessels and terminals will be less complex and less expensive to implement
than for large vessels and terminals. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal,
if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you
think that your business qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact
on your business, please submit a comment (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically
affect your business.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the regulations that govern how the Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of
Land Management, administers livestock grazing. This proposed rule would apply to all lands on which the Bureau of
Land Management administers livestock grazing. This proposed rule would also amend the Department of the Interior's
appeals regulations pertaining to livestock grazing to provide consistency with administrative remedies provided
for in the grazing regulations, and would amend the regulations on cooperative relations to reflect changes in the
organization of certain advisory committees. The proposed changes are a part of an overall effort to improve the management
of the Nation's public rangeland resources. Public review and comment on this proposal is invited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43208). Comments received on the advance notice have been considered in identifying and refining
key components of the rangeland reform effort and in preparing this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the great volume of comments anticipated on this proposed rule, the Department requests that reviewers identify
the specific section and paragraph label for the regulatory text on which they are commenting. Specific statements
of what regulatory text the reviewer feels should be modified, and the reasons for the recommended changes, are encouraged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed amendment to 43 CFR parts 4, 1780, and 4100 is part of the Department of the Interior's Rangeland Reform
'94 package. The provisions of this proposed rule are necessary to ensure proper administration of livestock grazing
on the public rangelands and to bring about reform in the management of rangelands for the improvement, protection,
and proper function of rangeland ecosystems. Many of the proposals would result in greater consistency between the
administration of grazing on public rangelands by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and administration of grazing
on National Forest System lands by the United States Forest Service (Forest Service). This proposed rule would govern
the BLM's administration of livestock grazing on public rangelands. It is proposed under the principal authorities
of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1901

An advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43208). The comment period on the advance notice ended September 13, 1993, and was subsequently
reopened for a 30-day period that ended October 20, 1993. A notice of intent to prepare an associated environmental
impact statement (EIS) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 13, 1993 (58 FR 37745), and August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43234). These notices requested public comment to assist in
the scoping process for the EIS. The comment period on the second notice of intent closed September 13, 1993, and was
subsequently reopened to correspond with the comment period on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. A booklet
entitled Rangeland Reform '94 was developed to describe the Secretary's proposal and approximately 35,000 copies
were distributed to all BLM grazing permittees and lessees, interested Congressional staff, and other interested
parties, in late August and September of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reviewers of this proposed rule may find it helpful to refer to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, August 13, 1993, in their consideration of this proposed rule. The advance notice contains some background material
that has not been reproduced in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a three-month period beginning November 17, 1993, Secretary Babbitt met on 20 occasions around the West with
groups which included western governors, State and local officials, ranchers, environmentalists and other public
land users. He visited locations in Colorado, Wyoming, and Oregon where on-the-ground consensus groups were already
engaged in addressing how land management decisions should be made, and participated in hundreds of hours of discussion
about the components of rangeland reform. The meetings in Colorado, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, Oregon,
Nevada and Utah resulted in many productive suggestions that are reflected in the new proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comments on the various documents distributed in the summer of 1993 and the meetings attended
by the Secretary, the Department has modified many of the initial proposals for reforming rangeland management.
The modified Rangeland Reform '94 proposal is summarized below. Much of the reform package is reflected in the proposed
regulatory text provided in this document. The public is asked to review this revised proposal and provide comments
and recommendations for improvement. Due to the great volume of comment anticipated, the Department requests that
reviewers specifically identify the section and paragraph labels for the proposed regulatory text on which they
are providing comment. Reviewers are also asked to provide suggested wording changes whenever possible. Comments
on this proposed rule will be analyzed in detail and considered in the preparation of a final rule. The Department also
intends to hold public meetings or hearings in western grazing States to obtain input on this proposal. Announcement
of the place and time for these meetings or hearings will be made in a separate notice. The Department anticipates publication
of the final rule late in calendar year 1994.

In addition to this proposed rule, the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, as a cooperating agency, have
prepared a draft EIS. The draft EIS is currently being printed and prepared for distribution, but advance copies are
available for public review at the Department of the Interior Library, First Floor, 18th and C Streets NW, Washington,
DC. Notice of availability of the draft EIS will be made through a separate publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The draft EIS analyzes in detail the proposed action and alternatives for improving the management of the Nation's
public rangelands, including regulatory changes proposed in this rule. The draft EIS also invites public comment.

Rangeland Reform '94 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rangeland Reform '94 is a proposal developed by the Department of the Interior through BLM, in close cooperation with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service, for effecting fundamental policy changes, including
adjustment of the Federal grazing fee, in its rangeland management program. The purpose of the proposed changes is
to make the BLM's rangeland management program more consistent with ecosystem management, to accelerate restoration
and improvement of the public rangelands, to obtain for the public fair and reasonable compensation for the grazing
of livestock on public lands, and to streamline certain administrative functions. As a result of public input on the
initial proposal, and as a result of the BLM's preliminary analysis of rangeland reform, two additional goals have
been included: to provide a mechanism for effective public participation in decisionmaking, and to focus Federal
and non-Federal management efforts where they will result in the greatest benefit. In achieving these goals the Department
also intends to make BLM's administration of livestock grazing more consistent with that of the Forest Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are five major categories of proposed management actions addressed in Rangeland Reform '94. These categories
are (1) The Federal grazing fee and associated incentives, (2) effective public participation in rangeland management,
(3) administrative practices, (4) range improvements and water rights, and (5) resource management requirements,
including standards and guidelines. Proposed actions within each of these categories are discussed in detail elsewhere
in this proposed rule.

Public Comment on the Initial Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of about 12,600 letters were received from about 8,000 persons on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking,
notice of intent to prepare an EIS, and the Rangeland Reform '94 summary booklet. These letters included over 56,000
individual comments. The specific aspects of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking generating the most comments
were the grazing fee and water rights associated with range improvement projects. Initial proposals related to affected
interests, grazing advisory boards, grazing permit and lease tenure, unauthorized subleasing, standards and guidelines
and full force and effect also generated a great number of comments. Many letters expressed opinions that the overall
rangeland reform proposal was a disincentive for good stewardship, would have major economic impacts on rural western
communities, and would result in the ``taking'' of private property rights. A great number of comments supported
the identified need for consistency between regulations of the BLM and the Forest Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the invitation of Colorado's Governor Roy Romer, Secretary Babbitt met on nine separate occasions with a group
of State and local officials, ranchers, conservationists and other land users in Denver and Gunnison, Colorado,
for discussions regarding a process for building a consensus-driven local approach to rangeland management. The
Colorado Working Group also made suggestions to change or improve the advance Rangeland Reform '94 proposal introduced
in August, 1993. Similar meetings and follow-up discussions were held in Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada, in addition to
meetings in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These meetings with the Secretary involved hundreds of hours of discussion. Input from these meetings resulted in
many of the changes and clarifications made in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment the Department has made a number of changes in the initial proposal. An attempt has been
made to identify the most substantial changes in the section-by-section analysis provided in this proposed rule.

Brief Discussion of Major Elements of Rangeland Reform '94 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following presents the general proposals of Rangeland Reform '94 and highlights significant changes made in
response to public input on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. Detailed descriptions of the specific regulatory
changes being proposed are presented in the section-by-section analysis following this discussion.

The Federal Grazing Fee and Associated Incentives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule presents a formula that is intended to correct the fundamental problems of the present fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first problem is the wide disparity between rates charged for livestock forage on private and State lands versus
the rate charged on Federal lands. In many western States, the fee for grazing on private nonirrigated lands is far
greater than it is on Federal lands. As the following chart shows, in 1993, the private grazing land lease rates in most
western States were several times the Federal fee.

There are similar disparities between grazing fees charged on State lands and the Federal fee. For grazing year 1994
the Federal grazing fee established under existing regulations in 43 CFR part 4100, is $1.98 per animal unit month
(AUM). This fee compares to western State trust land fees of as low as $1.53 in Arizona to fees ranging from $4.00 to more
than $20.00 in some of the western States for their 1994 grazing year. The different formulas, and the use of competitive
bidding in some States, make it difficult to present an average of the State trust land grazing fees, but in the States
of Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, the largest States in terms of the number of BLM AUMs authorized,
the State trust land fees per AUM range from a low of $3.00 in Wyoming to $4.53 in Idaho in 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second problem of the current fee formula is that while forage value in the private market has increased substantially
over time, the Federal grazing fee formula has produced relatively small increases and, in some years, decreases.
In 1980, for example, the private grazing land lease rate for the 11 western States, weighted by survey weights as determined
by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, was $7.53, while the Federal fee was $2.36; thus, the difference
between the private and Federal rates in 1980 was $5.17. In 1993, the private grazing land lease rate for the 11 western
States was $10.03, while the Federal fee was $1.86. Thus, the difference between the two figures had jumped to $8.17.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed formula would address the failure of the existing formula adequately to reflect private grazing land
market conditions by including a base value that considers the cost differences of operating on public lands as compared
to private leases, as well as appraisal data, and by annually adjusting the fee in proportion to changes in private
grazing land lease rates. After an initial phase-in period, the fee would be adjusted annually to reflect the change
in the private land lease rate in the 17 western States (i.e., forage value index). Although no explicit index based
on production costs or value of products produced is used, both factors influence the prices paid for forage and so
are, to some extent, implicit in the forage value index. The proposed formula is essentially a return to the simpler
formula that was in effect before 1978 using an updated base value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the proposed rule would move toward greater equity among fees, it would still result in a fee below the fees charged
for grazing on State lands in most western States, and would fall well below private grazing land lease rates. The amount
by which the fee would increase is similar to recent increases that have taken place at the State level; those increases
have not led to noticeable shifts in the livestock industry or economic effects on communities in those States. This,
when considered with the reasonableness of the proposed fee increase and the fact that more than 73 percent of BLM permittees
and lessees would experience a fee increase of less than $1,000 per year, offers evidence that the proposed change
in the fee would generally not have a significant impact on the stability of the dependent western livestock industry
and would not have a serious detrimental effect on most permittees and lessees. Some permittees and lessees that are
highly dependent on Federal forage, do not have off-ranch income, and have heavy debt loads may be required to make
some financial adjustments. These adjustments, in some circumstances, may include sale of the ranch; however, it
is expected that such sales will occur in limited circumstances. Such sales, it should be noted, are occurring and
will continue to take place under current conditions, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact on western communities is expected to be localized and, in most areas, not significant because
that portion of the local economy that depends upon the use of Federal forage is relatively minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial proposal generated a great amount of public comment both for and against increasing the fee. Most of the
comments related to the anticipated impacts to individual operators and to rural western economies. Many respondents
suggested regional economic differences, the cost of investment in public lands, and overall rangeland resource
conditions should be considered in determining grazing fees. Some felt the proposed fee would be economically devastating,
and some felt that a fee increase was warranted, but the proposal represented too little or too great an increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the public input gained following the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and through the scoping
process for the environmental analysis of Rangeland Reform '94, the Department has determined that the fee formula
initially proposed represents a reasonable and equitable method for calculating the fee. However, an adjustment
in the forage value index is proposed in this draft. A provision for an incentive-based fee has also been added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A base value of $3.96 per AUM to be used in calculating the grazing fee is proposed in this rule. This value represents
a midrange between the results obtained through the use of two methods for estimating a fair base value. Explanation
of the methodology used in arriving at the $3.96 base value is presented in the discussion of section 4130.7&hyph;1.
The proposed fee would be phased in over the years 1995 through 1997. Thereafter, annual increases or decreases in
the grazing fee resulting from changes in the forage value index would be limited to 25 percent of the amount charged
the previous year to provide for a measure of stability that would facilitate business planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would establish 1996 as the base year for the forage value index used in the formula. The forage value
index would not be used to adjust the fee annually in response to market conditions until the year 1997. This proposed
rule would establish the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter the fee would be calculated,
except as provided below, using the base value of $3.96 multiplied by the revised forage value index. By definition,
the forage value index in the year 1997 would equal one; yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent years the
calculated fee would depend on the changes in the market rate for private grazing land leases as reflected by the forage
value index. By comparison, the 1994 grazing fee established under the existing regulations is $1.98 per AUM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change in the derivation of the forage value index is proposed to reduce the uncertainty in the fee in the immediate
future that resulted from using a forage value index based on less current private land lease rate data. Under the proposal
presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the fee would have been adjusted annually by a forage value
index based on the average price paid for private grazing in the years 1990 through 1992. Assuming that forage value
index would have remained constant until the end of the phase in period provided in the advance notice, the formula
would have yielded a grazing fee of $4.28 per AUM as compared to a 1997 fee of $3.96 per AUM using the revised forage value
index.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to examine the effect of the proposed grazing fee during the phase-in period to determine the
need for any adjustment in the fee formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New provisions have been added to the proposed rule that would provide for an incentive-based grazing fee and would
restrict implementation of the $3.96 base value in the event a separate regulation setting forth eligibility criteria
is not issued by 1997. In recent years the Department has considered several proposals for incentive-based grazing
fees targeted at permittees and lessees who have improved rangelands, contributed to healthy, functional ecological
conditions, and fostered the achievement of resource condition objectives. The Public Rangelands Improvement
Act (43 U.S.C. 1901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Taylor Grazing Act provide authority for the Department to implement incentive-based grazing fees. The
Department recognizes that an incentive-based fee would be a valuable tool for encouraging stewardship. It was not
possible to develop proposed eligibility criteria for the incentive-based fee in time to include them in Rangeland
Reform '94. However, in anticipation of the issuance of a separate rule setting forth eligibility criteria, the Department
has included in the proposed rule a 30 percent reduction in the grazing fee for permittees and lessees who meet the criteria.
The 30 percent reduction would be implemented in the first grazing year after the Department issues a separate final
rule setting forth the eligibility criteria. These criteria would focus primarily upon those permittees and lessees
who agree to participate in special rangeland improvement programs characterized by best management practices,
the furtherance of resource condition objectives, and comprehensive monitoring. The Department anticipates that
eligibility criteria would require the permittee or lessee to undertake management practices beyond those otherwise
required by law and regulation to benefit the ecological health of the public rangelands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure timely development of that rule, this proposed rule would provide that an alternative base value of $3.50
would be implemented in 1997 if the Department has not completed the eligibility criteria. The Department intends
to use its best efforts to issue a final rule establishing incentive criteria in time to provide an opportunity for
the reduced fee in grazing year 1996. Such a discount would result in a grazing fee of $2.77 per AUM in 1996 and 1997 for
qualifying permittees and lessees. Reviewers are asked to provide suggested criteria for qualifying for the reduced
fee that address the improvement and maintenance of rangeland health, the furtherance of resource condition objectives,
and comprehensive monitoring.

Public Participation in Rangeland Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An important element of true rangeland reform involves allowing more Americans to have a say in the management of their
public lands. The American rangelands can be_and are_used for far more than grazing. Hiking, birding, fishing, hunting,
and mountain biking are among the activities that are compatible with sound grazing practices. All of the public interests
will be served by the public lands as long as all of the public interests are represented when decisions are being made.
Thus, increased public participation is essential to bringing lasting changes to management of our public lands.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in this general category are proposals for the formation of multiple resource advisory councils in most
BLM administrative districts and the involvement of the multiple resource advisory councils in the development
of standards and guidelines for grazing, a provision allowing multiple resource advisory councils to establish
and select members of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams for the purpose of providing input to be
used by the resource advisory council in developing recommendations, removal of references to the National Public
Lands Advisory Council, district advisory councils, and grazing advisory boards, and modification of how interested
members of the public can become involved in specific grazing decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most comments on the advance notice, and a great deal of the input gained through the Secretary's visits to western
states, supported modification of the initial proposal to expand the definition of affected interests, eliminate
grazing advisory boards and district advisory councils, and create an advisory mechanism with broader representation
and much more direct involvement. Many comments expressed a concern that local input would be overshadowed by interests
not directly affected by the decisions to be made while others asserted that all citizens should have an equal say in
the management of public lands. There was also a great amount of interest in making public participation more effective
by encouraging consensus-based forms of decisionmaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period of November 1993, through January 1994, Governor Roy Romer of Colorado convened and conducted nine
meetings of the Colorado working group on rangeland reform. Although this working group considered many of the proposals
of Rangeland Reform '94, a key finding of the group was that the current framework employed by the Department and the
BLM for encouraging community-based involvement was inadequate. This issue became the focus of much of the Working
Group's efforts. The Working Group prepared a summary of their findings and a model for enhanced community-based
involvement. The Department agrees with the findings of the group and has attempted to incorporate all key elements
of the model for public involvement in this proposed rule. The Working Group's model is presented in its entirety below:

Models for Enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Community-Based Involvement in Rangeland Reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 20, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Colorado Rangeland Reform Working Group (``working group'') is committed to these seven goals: (1) Healthy and
sustainable rangeland ecosystems, (2) healthy, sustainable and diverse economies and communities (3) accountability
of management and users of public lands to broad public goals, (4) efficient and effective management of our public
lands, (5) fostering mutual respect among public land users, (6) encouraging the retention of private land open space,
and (7) ensuring public lands are managed to comply with federal laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with these goals, the Colorado working group has concluded that the current framework for public and community-based
involvement in public lands management is inadequate. That framework could be significantly enhanced by experimenting
with a bottom-up, grass roots model of public participation that includes multiple interests and some identified
areas of responsibility for on-the-ground rangeland management decisions, and ensures that all members of the public
who wish to actively participate in public rangelands decisions, have a full opportunity to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These recommendations are based on two principles: (1) This is a Colorado model (the Colorado working group recognizes
that this Colorado model may not be applicable to other western states, and that there may be other models that are better
suited to those states); and (2) that this Colorado model represents a change from the current and/or traditional
management and that this is an experimental approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The working group has explored a number of different models based in part on the favorable experiences of community
and ecosystem-based approaches like that underway in Gunnison, Colorado; the ``Owl Mountain'' example in Jackson,
County, Colorado; the Coordinated Resource Management (CRM) experience near Craig, Colorado; and the Federal Lands
Program in Montezuma County, Colorado. We recognize that these models may not be appropriate for other states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of discussion, the attached ``draft'' represents an experimental approach to reforming the governance
structure for advisory boards and community-based rangeland decision-making. Based on the working group's discussions
to date, there is consensus on the basic approach suggested by these models_and consensus on the value of having Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt share this draft with other states and experts in the Department of the Interior for their
review. The group further agrees that many of the concepts and ideas described in this model could be useful and applicable
to the U.S. Forest Service.

I. Multiple Resource Advisory Councils
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The working group recommends that Multiple Resource Advisory Councils be created in order to advise the BLM on a wide
variety of public lands issues, including grazing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Group consensus exists that these councils should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Focus on the full array of ecosystem and multiple use issues associated with federal lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have up to 15 members appointed on a nonpartisan basis by the Interior Secretary. In making the appointments,
the Secretary shall consider the recommendations of the Governor. Membership shall be self-nominated. Members
could be nonresidents. Nominations will be accompanied by letters of recommendation from local interest groups
which the nominee will be representing. At least one member will be a local elected official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require that members bring to the table; (1) a commitment to collaborate, (2) relevant experience or expertise,
and (3) a commitment to success and to apply the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require that, in the aggregate, council membership must represent the full array of issues and interests,
custom and culture related to federal land use, management, protection, and a general understanding of the federal
laws and regulations governing these lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participate directly and effectively in the preparation and amendment of resource management plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Serve as a link between broad national policy direction and the more specific local, on-the-ground actions
and public input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have an effective role with respect to influencing or guiding decisions about the implementation of resource
area plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require that all council members attend a ``rangeland ecosystem course of instruction'' within three months
of their appointment. (The working group agreed to an acceptable standardized curriculum and process_such as the
Rangeland Ecosystem Awareness Program developed by a subgroup_with a full understanding of the associated costs
and a number of the details yet to be worked out.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each council shall develop a policy on attendance to encourage full participation of all members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Jurisdictional Level
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the purpose of Multiple Resource Advisory Councils is to foster broader public input in planning and management
activities by federal public lands agencies, it makes sense for Councils to operate at a Jurisdictional level that
is: (1) Close to local communities, and (2) close to the land planning decisions made by federal agencies while still
ensuring that they are readily available and open to public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Colorado working group believes that to be effective in the State of Colorado, these advisory bodies need to be
created at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) District level. As appropriate, the formation of these Councils should
also allow for the integration of both BLM and Forest Service units into one Council, and as the respective agencies
move toward management and planning on an ecosystem basis, the Councils should re-align accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A governor or a Multiple Resource Advisory Council could petition the Secretary to authorize these Councils at a BLM
Resource Area level if that was thought to be desirable. A Rangeland Resource Team (described below) could make such
a request to the Multiple Resource Advisory Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Membership
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All interests, uses, and values should be represented to the extent possible, and a balanced composition should be
achieved. The District BLM manager (or his/her designee) would be non-voting ex-officio members of the Council.
Members would not be required to reside in the counties served by the respective BLM District. Members would be required
to demonstrate relevant experience and knowledge of the lands and communities in their Jurisdictional area. A single
individual could serve on only one Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Functions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The council would be advisory in nature. Council members would be involved in the preparation, amendment and implementation
of federal agency land management plans in an advisory capacity. If the Council disagreed with a federal land manager's
decision that relates to one of the Council's functions, the Council would have the authority to submit a request for
review of the decision to the Secretary. The Secretary's office would have discretion on the timeliness of a response,
although a date certain could be encouraged (20 to 30 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Council's opportunity to influence land management decisions shall be in compliance with the public participation
process outlined by federal laws (The National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the
Administrative Procedure Act, etc.) Opportunities to streamline and simplify these procedures need to be explored
(perhaps by fully utilizing other authorities noted in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Public Rangelands
Improvement Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council would have the authority to designate Rangeland Resource Teams (described below) and Technical Review
Teams to address specific issues or problems in the District and/or serve as fact-finding teams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Councils should work to promote better public participation and engagement in land management decisions, and to
foster conflict resolution through open dialogue and collaboration instead of litigation and bureaucratic appeal.

If it is thought to be desirable to authorize Multiple Resource Advisory Councils at other levels (i.e., below the
BLM District level), a governor or Multiple Resource Advisory Council could make that request to the Secretary, or
the Rangeland Resource Team could make such a request to a Multiple Resource Advisory Council. Multiple Resource
Advisory Councils could be created or ``chartered'' in one of three ways:

II. Rangeland Resource Teams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Within each BLM District and administrative unit, local Rangeland Resource Teams could be formed for the purpose
of enhancing public and community-based involvement in federal public lands decision-making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland Resource Teams are premised on the notion that rangeland decisions ought to be made with good stewardship,
with appropriate multiple use and compliance with federal laws as guiding principles. They are also premised on the
following principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Permittees are in the best position over time to exercise good stewardship, and to ensure full compliance with
federal laws, and that this opportunity is further enhanced by direct dialogue and full participation of community-based
environmental and wildlife/sportsmen interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Good stewardship and full compliance with federal law is enhanced and strengthened when community and public
interests are empowered with permittees, members of the public and agency officials in making decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A substantial portion of the increase in grazing fee revenues from public lands should be retained and expended
at the local level for the purpose of promoting the ecological health of the range and investing in good stewardship
practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There is value in empowering individuals no matter where they live to work in concert with federal and public
interests in resolving local public lands/rangeland issues at the community level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that these community-based Rangeland Resource Teams will have a true ecosystem focus. With time and
experience, this model could be organized around eco-regions rather than according to arbitrary land ownership
and federal management boundaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This vision cannot be achieved in one step. The opportunity presented by this model is to encourage good stewardship
by permittees and other users, and to improve rangeland use, rangeland ecosystems and management. The Colorado working
group believes this model is an important step toward enhancing these goals_while laying the foundation for this
broader vision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Jurisdictional Level
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to have credibility and to ensure that both community and public interests are represented, Rangeland Resource
Teams should be allowed to spring up in as small an area as a single allotment but in no case to go beyond an area larger
than that encompassed by the corresponding Multiple Resource Advisory Council for that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Creation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
They could be established and dissolved in any of the following ways:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By local initiative and petition to a respective Multiple Resource Advisory Council. If a petition is denied, the
locals could petition to be a FACA (Federal Advisory Committee Act) body (see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. By the Multiple Resource Advisory Council when deemed necessary by that Council.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As a matter of formality, all appointments would be made by the Multiple Resource Advisory Council. The teams could
be terminated by an affirmative act of the Council. Individual terms for team members would be established by the Council.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Membership
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Rangeland Resource Team membership would be limited to five members from the following interests: Two resident permittees
who hold permits in the area, one resident at-large community representative, one environmental representative
and one wildlife/recreation representative. The environmental representative and the wildlife/recreation representative
could be nonresidents; however, all members shall be required to demonstrate substantial knowledge and experience
of the land and community where they serve. Nominations will be accompanied by letters of recommendation from local
interest groups which the nominee will be representing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These members would be required to participate in a ``rangeland ecosystem course of instruction'' (the working group
agreed to an acceptable standardized curriculum and process_such as the Rangeland Ecosystem Awareness Program
developed by a subgroup_with a full understanding of the associated costs and a number of the details yet to be worked
out), and would also be required to demonstrate knowledge of the local rangeland ecosystem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, at least one member of the resource team must also be a member of the Multiple Resource Advisory
Council. Other team members could also serve as members of the Multiple Resource Advisory Council_but such dual appointment
would not be required. For purposes of this section, residency means two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Functions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary function of Rangeland Resource Teams is to encourage good stewardship, collaborative solutions and
healthy rangeland ecosystem management through collaboration and by providing recommendations and information
to the Multiple Resource Advisory Councils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These teams would encourage community and public participation and problem-solving on the ground. Rangeland Resource
Teams could have authority to spend the 12.5% range improvement monies currently under the authority of grazing advisory
boards, according to state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland Resource Teams would also be empowered to develop proposed solutions for local rangeland problems and
make recommendations to Multiple Resource Advisory Councils. These teams would participate in developing resource
management plans, act as fact finding bodies and make recommendations on rangeland improvement monies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Multiple Resource Advisory Councils shall give careful consideration to the recommendations, options and information
provided by the Rangeland Resource Teams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland Resource Teams could be charged with assisting in monitoring rangeland health and reporting on the full
scope of their activities to the Multiple Resource Advisory Councils on a regular basis. In addition, Rangeland Resource
Teams could be charged with assisting in implementing programs such as the Rangeland Ecosystem Course of Instruction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where Rangeland Resource Teams disagree with a management decision by the federal land manager, the team
could petition the Multiple Resource Advisory Council for an opinion or create a Technical Review Team (see below)
to make recommendations on specific issues. This does not preempt the ability of any citizen to challenge a management
or planning decision through the existing administrative and legal appeal process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although federal or state land managers would not be members of the Rangeland Resource Teams, open communication
and collaboration with federal land managers would be expected and encouraged. Federal land managers should be ex-officio
members of the boards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland Resource Teams could petition the Secretary for recognition as advisory bodies under FACA. In such cases,
these teams would be authorized to directly advise federal land managers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Technical Review Teams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Technical Review Teams (TRTs) can be established on an as needed basis by Multiple Resource Advisory Councils or Rangeland
Resource Teams if they are operating as a FACA body (see above). The Rangeland Resource Teams may request the Multiple
Resource Advisory Councils to establish TRTs. In some instances, the need for the TRT may be negated by the Rangeland
Resource Team performing a fact-finding role. Bodies that create TRTs (Multiple Resource Advisory Councils or Rangeland
Resource Teams that are functioning as FACA advisory bodies) must have at least one member on those TRTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TRTs could be empowered to investigate and develop proposed solutions to specific resource issues which may arise
in the local area. Such teams may also participate in the development of resource management plans by providing information
and options to the Multiple Resource Advisory Councils. TRTs can function as ``fact finding'' teams. Selection of
TRT members should be at the discretion of the Council and may be based on the recommendations of the Rangeland Resource
Team, but members should possess sufficient knowledge and expertise about the resource issues in the area. Federal
land managers as well as members of other governmental agencies could be ex-officio members of these teams.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directs the Secretary to establish advisory councils of not less
than 10 and not more than 15 members appointed from among persons who are representative of the various major citizens'
interests concerning the problems relating to land use planning or the management of the public lands located within
the area for which an advisory council is established. To comply with this direction and to improve on current practices
for obtaining advice on the management of public lands and resources, the Department has adopted the suggestions,
with appropriate modifications, provided in the Colorado model for purposes of its proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would establish multiple resource advisory councils. These councils would be subject to the Federal
Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix; FACA). The multiple resource advisory councils would focus on the full
array of ecosystem and multiple use issues associated with BLM-administered public lands. However, the multiple
resource advisory councils would not provide advice on internal BLM management concerns such as personnel or budget
expenditures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A multiple resource advisory council would typically be established for each BLM administrative district, but under
this proposed rule the area of jurisdiction could be modified to permit ecosystem-based management and planning.
The Department intends that BLM State Directors would be encouraged to consider whether the formation of multiple
resource advisory councils along ecoregion boundaries would be a more effective organization for obtaining advice
on the management of public lands within their areas of responsibility. A governor or multiple resource advisory
council could petition the Secretary to authorize these councils at a BLM resource area level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The multiple resource advisory councils would advise the Secretary of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management
on matters relating to ecosystem and multiple use issues associated with public lands and resources under the administrative
jurisdiction of the BLM. Multiple resource advisory councils would provide advice on preparation, amendment, and
implementation of land use management plans and activity plans, and would be consulted in the planning for range development
and improvement programs and the preparation of standards and guidelines for grazing administration. The multiple
resource advisory councils would not be involved in matters such as personnel decisions, or the allocation of budget
except to the extent of providing advice on the establishment of long-term plans and resource management priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multiple resource advisory council members would be appointed by the Secretary or other Federal official designated
by the Secretary. Governors of States in which the councils would be organized would be requested to provide a list
of nominees for the Secretary's consideration. The Secretary would encourage Governors to formulate nominations
through a process open to the public, and would consider whether such a process was undertaken in evaluating the nominations.
In addition, a public call for nominations would be made through a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as is provided in the existing 43 CFR 1784.4&hyph;1. Persons could nominate themselves for membership. Nominations
would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation from local interests that the nominee would be representing.
The Department invites public comment on whether such letters should be required to come from individuals within
the area to be served by the multiple resource advisory council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Membership of the multiple resource advisory council would reflect a balance of views to ensure that the council represents
the full array of issues and interests associated with public land use, management, protection and an understanding
of the Federal laws and regulations governing public lands. Individuals would qualify to serve on a multiple resource
advisory council because they have a commitment to collaborative effort, possess relevant experience or expertise,
and have a commitment to the successful resolution of resource management issues and to applying the relevant law.
An individual may serve on only one multiple resource advisory council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the multiple resource advisory councils would have 15 members, selected by the Secretary, with criteria for
membership clearly outlined. One third of the members of each multiple resource advisory council would be selected
from persons representing commodity industries, developed recreational activities, or use of public lands by off-highway
vehicles; one third would be selected from representatives of nationally or regionally recognized environmental
or resource conservation groups and wild horse and burro interest groups, from representatives of archaeological
and historical interests, and from representatives of dispersed recreational activities; and one third would be
selected from persons who hold State, county, or local elected office, and representatives of the public-at-large,
Indian tribes within or adjacent to the area, natural resource or natural science academia, and State agencies responsible
for the management of fish and wildlife, water quality, water rights, and State lands. At least one member of each multiple
resource advisory council would be required to be an elected official in the area covered by the council, in accordance
with the requirements of section 309 of FLPMA. The proposed rule would require the Secretary or designee to provide
for balanced and broad representation from within each of the three categories in appointing members of a multiple
resource advisory council.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All members of a multiple resource advisory council would be required to attend training in the management of rangeland
ecosystems to ensure a common understanding of many of the scientific, economic, social and legal considerations
involved in managing public lands. The Colorado working group developed a proposal for a ``Range Ecosystem Awareness
Program'' that would establish a basic curriculum that would include: basic rangeland ecology, human resource development,
the relationship of public land resources to private lands and communities, and the pertinent laws and regulations
affecting rangeland management. The Department intends to consider the Working Group's proposal in developing
the curriculum for the training of advisory council members and invites public comment and suggestions on the content
and structure of this required training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends that multiple resource advisory councils would employ a consensus-building approach in
developing recommendations for the BLM manager to whom they would report. To encourage this, the proposed rule would
require that at least three council members from each of the three groupings of interests must be present to constitute
an official meeting of a council, and at least three members from each of the three groupings of interest must be in agreement
for a council to provide an official recommendation to the BLM official to whom the council reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a multiple resource advisory council has concerns that its advice is being arbitrarily disregarded, the council,
upon agreement of all members, could request that the Secretary respond to such concerns within 60 days. This opportunity
for direct communication with the Secretary is separate and distinct from the administrative appeals process and
the Secretary's response would not constitute a decision on the merits of any issue that is or might become the subject

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed rule the multiple resource advisory councils could establish rangeland resource teams to enhance
public and community-based involvement in public lands decision-making pertaining to livestock grazing. Rangeland
resource teams would provide local level input to the multiple resource advisory council and would serve as fact-finding
teams. The rangeland resource teams may, among other functions, provide input to the multiple resource advisory
councils for grazing-related portions of land use plans and the planned expenditure of range improvement moneys.
At the direction of the multiple resource advisory councils, rangeland resource teams may provide input and recommendations
to the multiple resource advisory council for an area ranging from a single grazing allotment to the entire area under
the jurisdiction of the multiple resource advisory council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, local citizens could petition the multiple resource advisory council to establish a rangeland
resource team, or a rangeland resource team could be established by the multiple resource advisory council on its
own initiative. Rangeland resource teams would have a minimal core membership that would include two resident permittees
who hold Federal grazing permits or leases within the area for which input is sought, one resident at-large community
representative, one environmental representative and one wildlife/recreation representative. For purposes
of the proposal, in order to be a resident, an individual must have lived within the geographical area covered by the
rangeland resource team for at least two years. The environmental representative and the wildlife/recreation representative
could be nonresidents. However, all members would be required to demonstrate substantial knowledge and experience
of the land and community where they serve. Nominations would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation
from the local interests that the nominees will be representing. At least one member of the core group would also be
a member of the multiple resource advisory council. All members of the rangeland resource team would be required to
attend the training in the management of rangeland ecosystems required for members of the multiple resource advisory
council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the rangeland resource teams would provide local-level input, perform a fact-finding role and provide options
and recommendations to the multiple resource advisory council, as opposed to serving in an advisory capacity to Federal
land managers, it is anticipated that these groups would not be subject to the requirements of FACA. However, rangeland
resource teams could petition the Secretary for recognition as advisory bodies under FACA. In such cases, the rangeland
resource teams would be authorized to directly advise Federal land managers on matters pertaining to livestock grazing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland resource teams would have opportunities to raise any matter of concern with the multiple resource advisory
council and to request that the multiple resource advisory council form a technical review team, as described below,
to provide information and options to the council for their consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provides that multiple resource advisory councils could establish technical review teams on an
as-needed basis in response to requests of interested citizens, the authorized officer, or on their own motion. Technical
review teams could also be established on an as needed basis by rangeland resource teams that have been chartered as
FACA bodies. Technical review teams would be limited to tasks assigned by the multiple resource advisory council
or chartered rangeland resource team and would report to the parent committee. The technical review teams would consider
specific issues for the purpose of providing local level input and serving as fact-finding teams. The technical review
teams would not be subject to FACA because they will not be advising Federal officials. A technical review team would
be dissolved by the parent committee upon completion of the assigned task.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The membership of a technical review team would be selected by the multiple resource advisory council, or rangeland
resource team where chartered under FACA. The technical review team would be required to include at least one member
of the multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland resource teams and technical review teams serving in a fact-finding role for the purpose of providing input
to the multiple resource advisory council would in no way preclude the collection and analysis of scientific data
by BLM, or the BLM's use of technical experts from outside of the Bureau. To the contrary, information collected by
the fact-finding teams and BLM should be complementary and, in combination, would provide a multiple resource advisory
council with a solid basis from which to form a recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative concept for technical review teams is also under consideration. Under this alternative, technical
review teams would be formed to address specific unresolved technical issues by the BLM authorized officer on the
motion of the BLM or in response to a request by the multiple resource advisory council. Where the technical review
team is requested by the multiple resource advisory council, the charge for the technical review team would be written
jointly by the BLM and the advisory council. The purpose of the team would be to gather and analyze data and develop recommendations
to aid the decisionmaking process, and functions of the team would be limited to tasks assigned by the authorized officer.
Review team members would be composed of BLM or other government employees, with at least one member from a State agency
or a Federal agency other than BLM. The authorized officer would also be allowed to employ and compensate private sector
consultants who would function as team members, and to compensate team members for per diem and travel expenses. The
authorized officer, in consultation with the multiple resource advisory council, would determine team membership,
establish the task of the technical review team, appoint a team leader, provide administrative support, and determine
when the team should be disbanded. In the selection of team members, preference will be given to scientific and technical
experts who have experience in the bio-physiographic region of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authorized officer would be required to specify a time period for the completion of the assigned task. Technical
review teams would terminate upon completion of the task assigned, or the time period established by the authorized
officer, whichever comes first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternative concept for technical review teams would not result in the formation of advisory committees under
the Federal Advisory Committee Act because team members would either be Federal or other government agency employees,
or paid consultants. The Department invites public review and comment on this alternative as well as the concept for
technical review teams included in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While specific functions for rangeland resource teams and technical review teams are outlined in this proposed rule,
there is another reason for their creation. The teams are designed to facilitate input from the many consensus groups
that have formed_and will form_throughout the West. Groups such as the Gunnison Group from Colorado, the Oregon Watershed
Improvement Group and Wyoming's Sun Ranch Stewardship effort all took root voluntarily. These groups are proving
that ranchers, environmentalists and others can come to agreement on land management practices. Rather than replace
these kinds of groups, the new teams are designed to bring them closer to the process, to allow their influence to spread
across the West. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although FLPMA requires that the Secretary establish advisory councils, there is no statutory requirement for the
formation of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams. While the Department views the provisions for
multiple resource advisory councils' use of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams as significant
advances in the promotion of public participation and consensus-based decisionmaking, the Department recognizes
that the success of the concept would hinge on many factors. Active participation, willingness to donate time and
travel expenses, willingness to work collaboratively toward recommendations to the advisory councils, and knowledge
of resource management principles are all critical to the success of the rangeland resource team and technical review
team concept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of the demanding requirements for the success of the two forms of input teams, the Department is considering
an alternative of proposing the use of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams on an experimental basis
rather than adopting the proposal BLM-wide. The Department invites the public to comment on the merits of providing
for the use of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams on an experimental basis. Comments are specifically
requested on the criteria for selecting areas for the experimental implementation of the rangeland resource teams
and technical review teams. Criteria could include broad-based support for participation in a consensus-building
approach among the interested parties, and interested parties having demonstrated the ability to work cooperatively
and provide consensual advice on public rangeland issues.

Range Improvements and Water Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial proposals pertaining to ownership of range improvements and water rights generated a great number of
comments. Most of the comments were not opposed to the intent of the proposed changes to conform with the common practice
of keeping title to permanent improvements in the name of the party holding title to the land. However, many respondents
expressed concern that the wording suggested that the Federal government would take existing rights to range improvements
and water. The text pertaining to range improvement ownership has been modified in this proposed rule and a new section
has been added to clarify the provisions for water rights associated with livestock grazing on public lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that title to all new grazing-related improvements constructed on public lands,
or made to the vegetation resource of public lands, except temporary or removable improvements, would be in the United
States. Since the proposed change would be prospective, valid existing rights to range improvements and compensation
therefor under section 402(g) of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1752(g)) would not be affected. The permittee or lessee may hold
title to removable range improvements authorized as livestock handling facilities such as corrals, creep feeders
and loading chutes, and to temporary improvements such as troughs for hauled water. With respect to new permanent
improvements, a permittee's, lessee's, or cooperator's interest for contributed funds, labor, and materials would
be documented. This documentation is necessary to ensure proper credit pursuant to section 402(g) of FLPMA, which
provides compensation for the permittee's or lessee's authorized permanent improvements whenever a permit or lease
is canceled, in whole or in part, in order to devote the lands to another public purpose. New permanent water improvement
projects such as spring developments, wells, reservoirs, stock tanks, and pipelines, would be authorized through
cooperative range improvement agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would carry forward the proposals in the advance notice regarding the distribution and use of range
improvement funds and add a requirement to consult with multiple resource advisory councils during the planning
of range development and improvement programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provides consistent direction for the BLM regarding water rights on public lands for livestock
watering purposes. It is intended to generally make BLM's policy consistent with Forest Service practice, and with
BLM policy prior to being changed in the early 1980's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, any new rights to water on public land for livestock watering on such land would be acquired,
perfected, maintained, and administered under State law. In all cases involving the development and registration,
pursuant to State law, of new rights to water on public land for livestock watering, cooperative agreements will be
used to provide that such livestock water rights are to be used and maintained in conjunction with the grazing permit
or leases and do not give rise to a claim for compensation in the event the permit or lease to which it is attached is canceled
in whole or in part to devote the lands to another public purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would not create any new Federal reserved water rights, nor would it affect valid existing water rights.
Any right or claim to water on public land for livestock watering on public land by or on behalf of the United States would
remain subject to the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 666 (the McCarran Amendment) and section 701 of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701
note; disclaimer on water rights). Finally, the proposal would not change existing BLM policy on water rights for
uses other than public land grazing, such as irrigation, municipal, or industrial uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to new water rights, some comments have suggested that permittees and the United States file jointly
for water rights on public lands associated with livestock watering on public lands. When permitted by State law or
regulation, for ease of administration, co-application with the lessee could be authorized, as it is in Wyoming.
The proposed rule does not contain such a provision, although if joint filing is permitted under State law, and filing
exclusively in the name of the United States is not, then the proposed language would permit joint filing. Comments
are specifically sought on whether the rule should mandate joint filing to the extent consistent with or even if not
permitted under, State law or if the current language in the proposed rule is preferable. Comments are sought in particular
on whether co-applications should be allowed where it would not change the underlying ownership of the water right.

Administrative Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in this category are disqualification of applicants for grazing permits and leases, expedited procedure
for the review of administrative appeals and implementation of decisions, issuance of grazing preference, a surcharge
for the authorized leasing or subleasing of grazing preference associated with base property or pasturing of livestock
owned by other than the permittee or lessee, suspended nonuse, and unauthorized use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has made several changes in the initial proposals affecting administrative practices in response
to public input. Aspects of the initial proposals regarding administrative practices that received the greatest
number of comments were adjustments in permit and lease tenure as a performance incentive, full force and effect of
decisions, disqualification of applicants who have had permits or leases canceled for violation of terms and conditions
of State and Federal grazing permits, authorized leasing and subleasing surcharges, and the elimination of suspended
nonuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to limit permit and lease tenure in some instances to 5 years has not been carried forward from the advance
notice of proposed rulemaking. Public comment on the advance notice suggested the proposal would do little to encourage
stewardship and would inadvertently penalize operators new to public land grazing, especially those starting in
the business, by inhibiting their ability to secure necessary financing. The Department agrees that the proposal
in the advance notice related to permit and lease tenure could result in unacceptable impacts and has withdrawn that
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to place grazing administration decisions in full force
and effect generated some confusion and has been clarified in this proposed rule. The objective of placing decisions
in full force and effect is to expedite placing decisions into effect to benefit resource conditions and to address
administrative problems. The proposal would not take away the ability of affected parties to file an appeal or to request
a stay of the decision until such time as the appeal is decided. The Department believes this is critical to meet the
goals of streamlining administration and focusing limited resources where they can do the most good, and has retained
the substance of the initial proposal. An attempt has been made to clarify the explanation of the proposed appeal provisions
in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, persons choosing to appeal a decision of the authorized officer would be provided a 30-day
period in which to file an appeal. Appellants requesting a stay of the decision would be required to file a petition
for stay with their appeal. In the instance where a petition for stay has been filed with an appeal, the Department of
the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals would have 45 days from the expiration of the 30-day appeal period either
to grant or deny the petition for stay, in whole or in part. Thus, where a person has filed a petition for stay of the decision
of the authorized officer along with an appeal, and where the request for stay is denied, implementation of the decision
could be delayed up to 75 days. In the event a stay of the decision is granted, the decision would be stayed until such
time as a determination on the appeal is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial proposal to disqualify applicants for grazing permits and leases as a result of cancellation of State
or Federal grazing permits and leases during the 36 months preceding application has been modified in response to
public comment. This proposed rule would limit the provision for disqualification on the basis of cancellation of
grazing permits during the preceding 36 months to applications for new or additional permits and leases. Also, consideration
of an applicant's history of compliance with the terms and conditions of State permits and leases has been limited
to State permits and leases within the boundary of the Federal grazing allotment for which application has been made.
Cancellation of such State permits or leases within 36 months prior to application would disqualify applicants for
new or additional Federal permits or leases. A new provision has been added that would make it clear that partial suspension
of a Federal grazing permit or lease would not be grounds for disqualification. Partial suspension of a permit or lease
is a measure used where actions of the permittee or lessee are not determined to justify cancellation. The Department
feels that disqualification of applicants on the basis of partial suspension would result in excessive punitive
action and would reduce the usefulness of partial suspension in addressing violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking provided for automatic disqualification on the basis of the suspension
or cancellation of an applicant's other Federal or State grazing permits or leases during the 36 months prior to application.
Under the proposed rule, the consideration of an applicant's history of performance on other Federal or State grazing
permits or leases would not apply to applicants for the renewal of a BLM grazing permit or lease. The Department invites
comment on whether an applicant's history of performance on other Federal and State grazing permits and leases should
be added as a discretionary, rather than automatic, basis for determining qualification for the renewal of a BLM grazing
permit or lease. Also, the Department invites comment on whether a similar provision for a discretionary review of
past performance should apply to applicants for new or additional BLM permits or leases, in addition to the automatic
disqualification where an applicant has had a Federal or State permit canceled for violation during the 36 months
prior to application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to eliminate suspended nonuse generated concern
that property rights and financing agreements would be affected. The Department does not agree with these comments.
For the most part it appears that these suspended AUMs have no real impact on ranches or on the condition of public lands.
The initial proposal was intended to remove all reference to suspended nonuse because only in rare instances has forage
placed in this category been made available for livestock consumption. However, given the contentious nature of
the issue and the fact that the Department views the matter as merely an administrative record-keeping issue, this
proposed rule does not carry forward the elimination of suspended nonuse presented in the advance proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous comments were received on the Department's proposal to levy a surcharge when the private property serving
as a base for public land grazing is leased or when livestock owned by other than the grazing permittee or lessee are
pastured on public lands. This proposal was made in response to findings of the General Accounting Office (see, e.g.,
RCED&hyph;86&hyph;168BR), the Office of the Inspector General (see report 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
92&hyph;1&hyph;1364) that permittees and lessees who sublease are unduly benefitting from their permits or leases.
A major criticism of the initial proposal was that it would penalize leasing arrangements with sons and daughters
of permittees and lessees who are grazing a few animals as part of an educational or group project, or sons and daughters
who are trying to build a livestock herd in anticipation of assuming all or part of the family operation. The Department
recognizes the need to avoid penalizing children of grazing permittees and lessees in these situations and has provided
for an exemption from the authorized subleasing surcharge for sons and daughters of public land permittees and lessees.
A broader criticism, which surfaced during meetings in Nevada, is that most pasturing agreements are a means of financing
available to ranchers who might not be able to finance their own inventory, and that contrary to the findings of the
General Accounting Office reports, they do not involve windfall profits taken by absentee landlords and permit or
lease holders. Some Nevada participants also suggested that any surcharge on the subleasing of permits and leases
should be formulated as a percentage of the return on the sublease rather than a percentage of the Federal grazing fee.
The Department invites comment on these two considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the comments received on the proposals relating to prohibited acts suggested that the proposed wording was
subject to broad interpretation that could lead to punitive action in response to violations unrelated to grazing
use. Subpart 4140, ``Prohibited Acts,'' would be amended to modify the list of acts that are prohibited on public lands
that could result in the loss of grazing permits or leases under subpart 4170. Particular attention is invited to proposed
section 4140.1(b)(12), which refers to Federal or State laws or regulations concerning, among other things, conservation
or protection of natural and cultural resources or environmental quality when public lands are involved or affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, of course, a great many laws or regulations that might fit within this category. These laws have independent
enforcement authority; that is, violations are dealt with under penalty provisions in these laws themselves. This
section of the existing regulations provides the possibility, in addition to these penalty provisions, of loss of
the grazing permit or lease for violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not the intent of the proposal for the authorized officer to take enforcement steps involving the grazing permit
or lease for any and all violations, no matter how 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or technical; or for violations of laws that, while they do deal with protection of natural and cultural resources
or the environment, do not centrally reflect upon the ability of the permittee or lessee to be a good steward of the public
lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, the intent is to provide the possibility of loss of the grazing permit or lease whenever more than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
violations of laws occur that do concern, in a more than remote way, the management of the public lands. Subsection
(b)(12) (i) through (vi) contains a narrative description of the kind of laws that, in our judgment, do directly concern
stewardship ability on the public lands. It is difficult to go beyond such a narrative description to list such laws
with precision, particularly in the text of the regulation itself. If that were done, a new rulemaking would be necessitated
each time a law were changed by the Congress, which happens not infrequently. Furthermore, a detailed list of laws,
with statutory and section numbers, would be lengthy and probably require the assistance of a law-trained person
to decipher.

References to the term ``affected interests'' have been removed throughout the rule and replaced with the term ``interested
public.'' The proposed rule would also remove the authorized officer's current discretion to determine whether
an individual is an ``affected interest.'' These changes were not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for the change is to provide a consistent standard for participation by the public. Any party who writes
to the authorized officer to express concern for the management of livestock grazing on specific grazing allotments
will be recognized as a member of the ``interested public'' under the proposed rule. This allows the BLM to develop
a record to assure notification of proposed and final decisions and to involve the ``interested public'' in the consultation
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for consultation with the interested public have been added in sections of the proposed rule that deal
with the initial allocation of forage, development of activity plans and range improvement programs, the issuance
or renewal of grazing permits or leases, and the establishment or adjustment of the terms and conditions of grazing
permits and leases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking included provisions that would allow the authorized officer to issue final
decisions without first issuing a proposed decision in specified circumstances. This proposed rule would carry
forward the provision that the authorized officer could directly issue final decisions when decisions are necessary
to protect rangeland resources from damage in ``emergency'' situations under section 4110.3&hyph;3(b), and would
add that decisions to close areas to certain forms of livestock use when necessary to abate unauthorized use, as provided
in section 4150.2(d), could be issued as final decisions without first issuing proposed decisions. The provisions
are necessary to provide responsive action in these circumstances. The other circumstances specified in the advance
notice that would not have required a proposed decision were nondiscretionary decisions, decisions that were previously
part of a broader final decision that was initially issued as a proposed decision, and decisions that involve the application
of discretion within the established terms and conditions of grazing permits and leases. These categories have been
removed in this proposed rule. However, there may be circumstances where resource protection and administrative
efficiency could be enhanced by avoiding the delay of implementation that occasionally can result from the protracted
resolution of protests of proposed decisions. In all cases, the right to appeal final decisions to the Office of Hearings
and Appeals would be retained. The public is invited to comment on whether there should be additional circumstances
where the authorized officer should have the ability to issue final decisions without first issuing a proposed decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new provision has been included in the proposed rule to eliminate the requirement for prolonged implementation
of necessary reductions in permitted livestock use when data, including field observations, show grazing use or
patterns of use are not consistent with standards and guidelines, are causing an unacceptable level or pattern of
utilization, or grazing use exceeds the livestock carrying capacity of the area. Under the existing regulations,
necessary reductions in livestock use of more than 10 percent have been phased in over a period of five years. Although
that provision may, in the short term, mitigate some of the adverse effects on permittees and lessees, it has inhibited
responsive action in situations where reductions in use are most needed. Under the proposed rule, the authorized
officer, after consultation with the affected permittee or lessee, the State having lands or managing resources
within the area, and the interested public, would take action to reduce grazing use either by reaching an agreement
with the involved parties or by decision. The Department anticipates that, in many cases, agreements can be reached
that would result in gradual reductions in use. However, the Department recognizes the need to provide for responsive
action where rangeland health and function is not being maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other proposals within the category of administrative practice have been modified somewhat in response to comments
received, while attempting to retain the general substance of the proposed actions. Also, an attempt has been made
to clarify many of the explanations of proposals, and to refine the regulatory text to more accurately achieve the
objective of the initial proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public comments on the standards and guidelines included as an appendix to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking
generally expressed doubt that it is possible to develop a set of national standards and guidelines that could be universally
applied to grazing administration on public lands. Many reviewers recommended that standards and guidelines should
only be developed at a more local level. Many comments also expressed uncertainty regarding whether the standards
and guidelines would have the effect of law given they were presented as an appendix rather than proposed regulatory
text.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that standards and guidelines prepared at a more local level would be better tailored to fit
resource conditions and livestock management practices. Therefore, the Department has not carried forward the
standards and guidelines as included with the advance notice. However, in order to promote greater administrative
consistency, and to focus management attention and resources where they will result in the greatest environmental
benefit, the Department recognizes a need to establish clear national requirements for grazing administration
and guidance for the preparation of State or regional standards and guidelines. These national requirements and
guiding principles for State or regional standards and guidelines have been included in the text of this proposed
rule. In addition, the Department recognizes the importance of putting standards and guidelines in place in a timely
manner, and has provided a mechanism for doing so in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends that State or regional standards and guidelines for grazing administration would be developed
in consultation with multiple resource advisory councils, interested public, and others within 18 months following
the effective date of the final rule. In the event State or regional standards and guidelines have not been completed
and approved by the Secretary within 18 months of the effective date of the final rule, fallback standards and guidelines
provided in this proposed rule would be implemented. The Department feels this provision for fallback standards
and guidelines is needed to provide for necessary resource protection and to encourage prompt action toward the development
of State or regional standards and guidelines. The fallback standards and guidelines would also provide a benchmark
by which to measure the adequacy of State or regional standards and guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national requirements, guiding principles for the development of State or regional standards and guidelines,
and the fallback standards and guidelines proposed in this rule all focus on attaining and maintaining healthy rangeland
ecosystems, including riparian areas. The Department recognizes that achieving and maintaining properly functioning
ecosystems is critical to the protection of public rangelands and resources, and resource uses. Achieving and maintaining
healthy rangeland conditions greatly benefits resources and uses such as wildlife and fish habitat, water quality,
and recreational activities. Although BLM land use plans and activity plans may provide for achieving resource conditions
that go beyond the benchmarks for ecological health and functional condition proposed in this rule, achieving properly
functioning ecosystems is prerequisite to the conservation of rangeland resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national requirements for all grazing-related plans and activities on public lands under this proposed rule
include continuing or implementing grazing practices that maintain or achieve healthy, properly functioning ecosystems
and riparian systems; continuing or implementing grazing practices that maintain, restore or enhance water quality
and assist in the attainment of water quality that meets or exceeds State water quality standards; and continuing
or implementing grazing management practices that assist in the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of the
habitat of threatened or endangered species, or species that are classified as candidates for threatened or endangered
species listing. These requirements are intended to reflect the fundamental legal mandates for the management of
public lands under the Taylor Grazing Act, FLPMA, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and other relevant authorities. Where existing management practices fail to meet these national requirements,
the BLM authorized officer would be required to take action as soon as practicable but not later than the start of the
next grazing year. This would include actions such as reducing livestock stocking rates, adjusting the season or
duration of livestock use, or modifying or relocating range improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards and guidelines would be developed to provide further guidance, within the framework of the national requirements,
in the administration of livestock grazing on public lands. Bureau of Land Management State Directors, in consultation
with the affected multiple resource advisory councils, would be responsible for identifying the appropriate geographical
area for which standards and guidelines would be developed. Standards and guidelines would be developed for an entire
State or for an ecoregion encompassing portions of more than one State. Standards and guidelines would not be prepared
for a smaller area totally within the boundaries of a single State except where the BLM State Director, in consultation
with the multiple resource advisory councils, determines that the combination of the geophysical and vegetal character
of an area is unique and the health of the rangelands within the area could not be adequately protected using standards
and guidelines developed on a broader geographical scale. The intent of this limitation on the geographical scope
of standards and guidelines is to provide for the development and application of uniform standards and guidelines
across an area including public lands of similar character. This limitation would result in more consistent application
of standards and guidelines, and would encourage collaboration between BLM offices, multiple resource advisory
councils, and the public in addressing the resource management needs and concerns of an area. Standards and guidelines
could be developed for ecoregions involving public lands within more than one State for the purpose of ensuring the
consistent application of rangeland management measurements and practices across an identifiable ecoregion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would establish guiding principles to be addressed in the development of standards and guidelines.
The guiding principles represent what the Department has identified as the resource concerns and types of management
practices that must be considered in the development of standards and guidelines. The guiding principles for the
development of standards are intended to provide focus on riparian area function and the minimum soil and vegetation
conditions required for rangeland ecosystem health. The guiding principles for the development of guidelines for
grazing administration provide focus on the consideration of management practices that assist in or do not inhibit
meeting certain legal mandates and achieving and maintaining rangeland health. Included in these guiding principles
are the requirements that State or regional guidelines address: grazing practices to be implemented to benefit threatened
or endangered species and candidate species, and to maintain, restore or enhance water quality; critical periods
of plant growth or regrowth and the need for rest from livestock grazing; situations in which continuous season-long
grazing, or use of ephemeral rangelands, could be authorized; the allowable types and location of certain range improvements
and management practices; and utilization or residual vegetation limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM State Director, in consultation with multiple resource advisory councils, the interested public, and others,
would be required to develop standards and guidelines that are consistent with the national requirements and the
guiding principles. It is anticipated that there may be a need to add additional standards and guidelines consistent
with the national requirements to reflect the State or regional resources, the character of the public lands, local
livestock management practices, and community interests. For example, State or regional guidelines may specify
limitations on the season of livestock use or thresholds for utilization by livestock in crucial big game winter ranges.
Multiple resource advisory councils, and their rangeland resource teams and technical review teams, would play
an important role in designing standards and guidelines to meet conditions and concerns encountered within the specific
State or region by facilitating open discussion and ensuring that the views of all interested parties are considered
in preparing their recommendations for the BLM. The BLM would not implement State or regional standards or guidelines
developed pursuant to this proposed rule prior to their approval by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule includes a provision for fallback standards and guidelines that would become effective 18 months
after the effective date of the final rule in the event that State or regional standards and guidelines are not complete.
The fallback standards and guidelines would remain in effect until State or regional standards and guidelines are
completed and approved by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fallback standards are largely based on indicators of soil stability and watershed function, distribution of
nutrients and energy, and the ability of plant communities to recover. The three categories of indicators, when considered
in combination, have been found to be key in assessing rangeland health. The standards are generally based on the findings
of the Committee on Rangeland Classification presented in ``Rangeland Health'' (National Research Council 1994)
and BLM's Riparian Area Management (TR1737&hyph;9, Process for Assessing Proper Functioning Condition, 1993).
A fourth fallback standard addresses indicators of healthy flood plain structure and condition, a critical component
of healthy rangeland ecosystems and riparian systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fallback guidelines would restrict management practices to those activities that assist in or do not hinder meeting
certain legal mandates and achieving or maintaining rangeland health. The fallback guidelines include the requirement
that grazing management practices be implemented that assist in or do not hinder the recovery of threatened or endangered
species, or assist in preventing the listing of species identified as candidates for threatened or endangered species.
This guideline is intended to avoid the impacts associated with the listing of more species as threatened or endangered.
A second guideline would require that grazing practices be implemented that would assist in attaining and protecting
water quality consistent with the Clean Water Act. The fallback guidelines would also require that grazing schedules
include periods of rest during times of critical plant growth or regrowth, and that continuous season-long grazing
be limited to instances where it has been demonstrated that such use would be consistent with achieving or maintaining
rangeland health and riparian functioning condition, and with meeting established resource objectives. Under
the fallback guidelines, development of springs or other projects affecting water would be designed to protect the
ecological values of the affected sites. Livestock management practices or management facilities such as corrals,
pipelines, or fences, would generally be required to be located outside of riparian-wetland areas, and where standards
for these areas are not being met, the facilities could be removed or relocated, or the management practices modified.
The fallback guidelines would require the establishment and application of utilization or residual vegetation
limits that would benefit the diversity and vigor of woody and herbaceous species, maintain healthy age-class structure
in riparian-wetland and aquatic plant communities, and would leave sufficient biomass and plant residue to provide
for sediment filtering, the dissipation of stream energy, and streambank stability and shading. Finally, the fallback
guidelines would require that allotment management plans and other activity plans addressing livestock grazing
that are developed or amended after the fallback guidelines become effective specify desired plant communities,
including minimum percentages of site vegetation cover, and incorporate utilization limits for both riparian and
upland sites to assist in achieving or maintaining proper functioning condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that the proposed fallback standards and guidelines may not fit all situations. A provision
has been included in the proposed rule that would allow BLM State Directors to adjust the fallback standards and guidelines,
subject to approval of the Secretary, to fit State or local conditions. However, in tailoring the fallback standards
and guidelines to more local conditions, the BLM State Directors must ensure that the general purpose of each of the
fallback standards and guidelines is met.

The national requirements proposed in this rule, and all standards and guidelines, whether fallback, State, or regional
would be implemented subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331

; NEPA) and applicable land use planning regulations. The national requirements and guiding principles for State
and regional standards and guidelines are analyzed in the draft EIS for Rangeland Reform '94. The fallback standards
and guidelines are also analyzed in the draft EIS. Any additional NEPA analysis required during development of State
or regional standards and guidelines would tier to the analysis of national requirements and standards and guidelines
presented in the EIS for Rangeland Reform '94.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM planning regulations direct that actions be in conformance with BLM land use plans. It is anticipated that
in most instances, established standards and guidelines, and associated implementation actions, would be in conformance
with existing land use plans, although in some cases land use plans may require modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's intent to develop State or regional standards and guidelines, complete plan conformance tests,
and undertake necessary plan amendments within 18 months of the effective date of the final rule. Development of the
State or regional standards and guidelines and any plan amendments that are necessary would occur simultaneously.
Thus, State or regional standards and guidelines would be implemented as they are finalized and approved by the Secretary.
If this has not occurred within 18 months of the effective date of the final rule, fallback standards and guidelines
would be put in place until the State or regional standards and guidelines are completed. The Department envisions
that all rangelands administered by the BLM under 43 CFR part 4100 would have enforceable standards and guidelines
by the end of the 18-month period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the national requirements and the standards and guidelines for grazing administration would
be accomplished by directing specific actions to promote or achieve the requirements and standards and guidelines.
The specific actions needed to implement the requirements, standards, and guidelines would be incorporated in the
terms and conditions of grazing permits and leases, and other grazing authorizations. Actions needed to implement
the requirements, standards, and guidelines would also be incorporated in allotment management plans or other activity
plans as they are prepared or amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that the authorized officer specify terms and conditions that would ensure conformance
with the national requirements, standards, and guidelines in all grazing leases and permits. These terms and conditions
would be added at the time of permit or lease issuance, including the transfer or renewal of permits or leases. However,
where the authorized officer determines that the national requirements or established standards and guidelines
are not being met under existing terms and conditions, the terms and conditions of grazing permits and leases and other
grazing authorizations would be modified as soon as practicable, but not later than the start of the next grazing year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflecting the national requirements and standards and guidelines in the terms and conditions of grazing permits
and leases would provide the management mechanism to help achieve, to the extent practicable, healthy rangeland
ecosystems. While grazing administration may not be the only factor affecting the health of rangeland ecosystems,
it is the Department's intent to ensure improvement in the context of grazing management through the standards and
guidelines for grazing administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends that all high priority grazing allotments would be reviewed for the need to modify terms and
conditions to ensure conformance with the national requirements, and standards and guidelines within three years
of the effective date of this rule. Priority would be based largely on the review of riparian area conditions. This
review, in combination with incorporating terms and conditions reflecting the national requirements and standards
and guidelines as permits and leases are issued, renewed or transferred, should ensure that a large portion of BLM
grazing allotments would be protected by the national requirements and the standards and guidelines. The public
is invited to provide comments and suggestions on the structure of the review of grazing allotments and the criteria
for determining the priority of allotments to be reviewed.

Section 1784.2&hyph;1&blank;Composition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be amended to remove the eligibility requirement for grazing advisory board members. This requirement
would no longer be necessary with the discontinuance of the grazing advisory boards. Composition for multiple resource
advisory councils and their rangeland resource teams and technical review teams would be provided for in the specific
sections of the proposed rule pertaining to such councils and teams.

Section 1784.2&hyph;2&blank;Avoidance of Conflict of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would clarify that permittees and lessees would be eligible for service on multiple resource advisory
councils, rangeland resource teams, and technical review teams. This change is necessary to ensure that all stakeholders,
including those with financial interests in the management of public lands, are able to provide input to multiple
resource advisory councils so that resource advisory councils would be able to develop recommendations based on
direct community and user input. The proposed rule would also provide that no advisory committee, rangeland resource
team or technical review team member could participate in any matter in which such member is directly interested.
Furthermore, members of multiple resource advisory councils would be required to disclose their direct or indirect
interest in Federal grazing permits or leases administered by BLM.

Section 1784.3&blank;Member Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would establish that appointments to advisory committees would be for two-year terms unless otherwise
specified in the charter. Specific references to grazing advisory board, district advisory council and National
Public Lands Advisory Council appointments, terms and election procedures, would be removed. Advisory committees
are established through individual charters or by statute. Membership requirements, terms of appointments and
election procedures must be prescribed in these charters and are, therefore, not necessary in this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the provisions for reimbursement of committee members' travel and per diem expenses would be modified to make
clear that individuals selected by committees to provide input, but who themselves are not appointed committee members,
shall not be eligible for reimbursement. Under the proposed rule the newly formed multiple resource advisory councils
would play a greater role in advising BLM land managers than the district advisory councils and grazing advisory boards
they generally replace. The Department expects that the expanded role of the councils would require more frequent
council meetings, resulting in greater administrative, travel, and per diem expenses to be incurred by BLM. The provision
that members of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams who are not also members of the parent advisory
council would not be reimbursed for expenses is intended to limit the expenses to be incurred by the BLM. However, the
limitation on reimbursements for travel and per diem could affect the ability of some persons to participate on the
input teams. The public is asked to provide specific comments and suggestions on whether this limitation is appropriate
or how it might be modified.

councils and associated input teams. Reserved sections 1784.6&hyph;2 and 1784.6&hyph;3 would be removed. The new
sections are discussed separately below.

Section 1784.6&hyph;1&blank;Multiple Resource Advisory Councils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would provide for the establishment of multiple resource advisory councils. One multiple resource
council would be established for each BLM administrative district except when prohibited by factors such as limited
interest in participation, geographic isolation in terms of proximity to users and public lands, or where the configuration
and character of the lands is such that organization of councils along BLM district boundaries is not the most effective
means for obtaining advice for the management of the ecosystems or resources of the area. The exceptions are intended
to provide for situations such as those encountered in Alaska where it is difficult for interested persons to participate
because of extreme travel distances, or situations where management of neighboring BLM districts or portions of
districts involving similar lands and ecosystems can best be served by organizing a multiple resource advisory council
along boundaries other than BLM district administrative boundaries. The determination of the area for which a multiple
resource advisory council would be organized would be the responsibility of the affected BLM State Director. Organization
by ecoregion boundaries would be encouraged where appropriate. The Governors of the affected States and established
multiple resource advisory councils could petition the Secretary to establish a multiple resource advisory council
for a specific BLM resource area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multiple resource advisory councils would provide advice to the Bureau of Land Management official to whom it reports
regarding the preparation, amendment and implementation of land use plans. The councils would also assist in establishing
other long-range plans and resource management priorities in an advisory capacity. The Department intends that
this would include providing advice on the development of plans for range improvement or development programs and
has included in the proposed amendments to 43 CFR subpart 4120 a requirement for consultation with multiple resource
advisory councils in the planning of range improvement or development programs. Multiple resource advisory councils
would not provide advice on personnel management, nor would they provide advice on the allocation and expenditure
of funds subsequent to budget planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appointments to multiple resource advisory councils would be made by the Secretary. In making appointments, the
Secretary would consider nominations from the Governor of the affected State and nominations received in response
to a public call for nominations. The Secretary would encourage Governors to develop their nominations through an
open public process. In reviewing nominations submitted by the Governors, the Secretary would consider whether
an open public process was used. All nominations would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation
from interests or organizations to be represented that are located within the area for which a council is organized.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary would appoint 15 members to each multiple resource advisory council. Five members would be selected
from persons representing commodity industries, developed recreational activities, or use of public lands by off-highway
vehicles; five would be selected from representatives of nationally or regionally recognized environmental or
resource conservation groups and wild horse and burro interest groups, from representatives of archeological and
historical interests, and from representatives of dispersed recreational activities; and five would be selected
from persons who hold State, county, or local elected office, and representatives of the public-at-large, Indian
tribes within or adjacent to the area, natural resource or natural science academia, and State agencies responsible
for the management of fish and wildlife, water quality, water rights, and State lands. The proposed rule would require
that at least one of the members appointed to each council must hold elected State, county, or local office. An individual
would not be allowed to serve on more than one multiple resource advisory council at any given time.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require council members to have demonstrated experience or knowledge of the geographic area
for which the council provides advice. The Department seeks comment as to the necessity of this requirement, particularly
as it applies to experts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the multiple resource advisory councils, the Secretary would rely on the provisions of the current
regulations found at 43 CFR 1784.3(f), governing the removal of advisory council members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that all members of multiple resource advisory councils would attend a course of instruction
in the management of rangeland ecosystems that has been approved by the BLM State Director. This requirement is intended
to ensure a common general understanding of the resources management principles and concerns involved in management
of the public lands. Public comment and suggestions are invited on the content and structure of this required training.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provides that an official meeting of a multiple resource advisory council requires at least three
members from each of the three broad categories of interests from which appointments were made. Formal recommendations
of the council would require agreement by at least three members of each of the three broad categories of interests
that attend an official meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multiple resource advisory councils would be provided the option of requesting Secretarial review where the council
believes its advice has been arbitrarily disregarded by the BLM manager. If requested, the Secretary would respond
directly to a council's concerns within 60 days. Such a request would require agreement by all 15 members of the council.
The Secretary's response would not constitute a decision on the merits of any issue that is or might become the subject
of an administrative appeal and would not preclude an affected party's ability to appeal a decision of the authorized
officer.

Section 1784.6&hyph;2&blank;Rangeland Resource Teams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would provide for the formation of rangeland resource teams by a multiple resource advisory council
on their own motion or in response to a petition by local citizens. Rangeland resource teams would be formed for the
purpose of providing local level input and serving as fact-finding teams for issues pertaining to grazing administration.
Rangeland resource teams would provide input and recommendations to the multiple resource advisory council on public
land grazing management issues within the area for which the rangeland resource team is formed. The geographical
scope of a rangeland resource team would not exceed the area for which the advisory council provides advice. Rangeland
resource teams organized under a multiple resource advisory council would not provide advice to the Federal land
manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland resource teams would consist of five members selected by the multiple resource advisory council. Membership
would include two persons holding Federal grazing permits or leases within the area for which the team is formed. Additional
members would include one person representing the public-at-large, one person representing a nationally or regionally
recognized environmental organization, and one person representing national, regional, or local wildlife or recreation
interests. Members representing grazing permittees or lessees and the local public-at-large would be required
to have resided within the area for which the team would provide advice for at least two years prior to their selection.
Persons selected by the council to represent the public-at-large, environmental, and wildlife or recreation interests
could not hold Federal grazing permits or leases. The proposed rule requires that at least one member of the rangeland
resource team be selected from the membership of the parent multiple resource advisory council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The multiple resource advisory council would be required to select rangeland resource team members from nominees
that qualify by virtue of their knowledge or experience of the lands, resources, and communities that fall within
the area for which the team is formed. All nominations for membership would be required to be accompanied by letters
of recommendation from the local interests to be represented. The membership provisions are intended to ensure that
rangeland resource teams are able to represent key stakeholders and interests in providing input to the more broadly
organized multiple resource advisory councils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that all members of rangeland resource teams would attend a course of instruction
in the management of rangeland ecosystems that has been approved by the BLM State Director. The Colorado working group
developed a proposal for a ``Range Ecosystem Awareness Program'' that would establish a basic curriculum that would
include: basic rangeland ecology, human resource development, the relationship of public land resources to private
lands and communities, and the pertinent laws and regulations affecting rangeland management. The Department intends
to consider the Working Group's proposal in developing the curriculum for the training of rangeland resource team
members and invites public comment and suggestions on the content and structure of this required training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangeland resource teams would have opportunities to raise any matter of concern with the multiple resource advisory
council and to request that the multiple resource advisory council form a technical review team, as described below,
to provide information and options to the council for their consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no specific provision has been made in the proposed rule, rangeland resource teams could petition the Secretary
for chartered advisory committee status. Chartered rangeland resource teams would be subject to the general provisions
of 43 CFR part 1780 and the provisions of the charter prepared pursuant to FACA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule a multiple resource advisory council could establish technical review teams, as needed,
in response to a petition of an involved rangeland resource team or on their own motion. Rangeland resource teams chartered
under FACA could also establish technical review teams. Technical review teams would conduct fact finding and provide
input to the parent multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team. Their function would
be limited to specific assignments made by the parent committee, and would be limited to the geographical scope and
scope of management actions for which the multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team
provides advice. Technical review teams would terminate upon completion of the assigned task.

in the assigned task. At least one member of each technical review team would be required to be selected from the membership
of the parent multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team.

The proposed rule would remove two definitions, add five new definitions, and revise 10 definitions in section 4100.0&hyph;5.
Generally these amendments would reduce redundancy and make the definitions more concise, germane, and understandable.
Several changes were made to the definitions presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, most notably,
the removal of the definition for ``Affected interest'' and replacement with the term ``Interested public.'' This
new term is used to recognize necessary public involvement in decisionmaking and to make 43 CFR part 4100 more consistent
with other BLM rules and those of the Forest Service.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would add requirements that applicants for the renewal or the issuance of new grazing permits or
leases, and any affiliates, must be determined by the authorized officer to have a satisfactory record of performance
based on specified standards. Applicants for renewal must be determined to be in substantial compliance with the
terms and conditions of the expiring permit or lease. In assessing whether an applicant for renewal is in substantial
compliance, the authorized officer would consider the number of prior incidents of noncompliance with the requirements
of 43 CFR part 4100, as well as the nature and seriousness of any single incident of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would deny a new permit or lease to those applicants who have had Federal grazing leases or permits,
or State grazing permits or leases within the Federal grazing allotment for which application is made, canceled due
to violations of terms or conditions during the 36 months preceding application. Applicants and their affiliates
that have been barred from holding a Federal grazing permit or lease by court order would also be determined to be disqualified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions pertaining to disqualification include changes made to the provisions of the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking. Restricting the scope of consideration of the applicant's history of performance under State leases
to those State lands located within the Federal grazing allotment boundary for which application is made is intended
to reduce the workload associated with obtaining and reviewing State records. Also, the inability of the applicant
to make use of State lands within the Federal grazing allotment would often inhibit the orderly administration of
the Federal permit or lease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking provided for disqualification on the basis of suspension or cancellation
of certain permits or leases. Under the proposed rule, suspension of grazing permits or leases, in whole or in part,
would not result in disqualification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions for disqualification would also affect the allocation of increased forage under &sect;&sect;4110.2&hyph;3
and 4110.3&hyph;1 and conflicting applications under &sect;4130.1&hyph;2. These three sections reference ``qualified
applicants.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments pertaining to the disqualification of applicants are intended to reflect the requirements of the
Taylor Grazing Act and FLPMA that public lands be managed in a way that protects them from destruction or unnecessary
injury and provides for orderly use, improvement, and development of resources, as well as provisions for renewing
permits and leases except where violations of rules and regulations and terms and conditions of the permit or lease
have occurred.

expiration of the preexisting permit or lease, grazing management of the acquired lands would become subject to the
provisions of 43 CFR part 4100.

operations but it need not be used for livestock production at the time the authorized officer finds it to be base property.
A provision has been added to the amendments presented in the advance notice to make clear that the permittee's or lessee's
interest in a base water previously recognized as base property shall qualify as base property. Where authorized
water developments on public lands that have been previously recognized as base property require reconstruction
or replacement in order to continue to service the same area, and the reconstructed or new development has been authorized
through a range improvement permit or cooperative range improvement agreement, the permittee's or lessee's interest
in the new or reconstructed water development would be recognized as base property.

of the base property be for a minimum time period of three years. These provisions are necessary to provide for stability
in meeting the objectives of these regulations for protection and improvement of the rangelands and resources and
to reduce the administrative work in processing transfers. Currently about 1,850 of the BLM leases or permits, approximately
10 percent of the total number, involve leased base property.

and by clarifying the requirements for consultation. Also, reference to a permittee's or lessee's demonstrated

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be amended by revising the heading, revising paragraph (b) to expand the list of methods for determining
when a reduction in grazing use is necessary, and by deleting paragraph (c). The amendment would add to monitoring
ecological site inventory and other recognized methods for determining forage production as methods of identifying
when use exceeds the livestock carrying capacity of the area considered. The amendment would also add a reference
to national requirements and standards and guidelines. Under this section the authorized officer would be required
to take or approve corrective action when grazing use or patterns of use result in less than properly functioning conditions
of the ecosystem, as established by the proposed national requirements and standards and guidelines and identified
through monitoring or field observations, or when use exceeds the livestock carrying capacity. The BLM Technical
Reference 4400&hyph;5 (Rangeland Inventory and Monitoring Supplemental Studies) describes acceptable methodologies
for estimating forage production. The revised section would allow the use of other acceptable methods to estimate
rangeland carrying capacity to be used as the basis for making initial adjustments in grazing use. Subsequent adjustments
could be made as monitoring data are collected and analyzed. The amendment would therefore allow more responsive
action when use or patterns of use result in a failure to meet resource condition objectives.

Section 4110.3&hyph;3&blank;Implementing reductions in Permitted Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would rename the section, would remove existing paragraph (a) and other requirements for phased-in
reductions in grazing use, and would amend existing paragraph (b) to remove the terms ``consultation, coordination
and cooperation,'' and ``suspension of preference'' and add in their place the terms ``consultation'' and ``reductions
in grazing use,'' respectively, and provide, by way of reference to &sect;4110.3&hyph;2, for the application of
national requirements and standards and guidelines and the use of other methods, in addition to monitoring, for determining
the need for an initial reduction. The change in the heading is intended to describe the section more accurately. The
removal of existing paragraph (a) and other requirements for phased reductions in use would allow more responsive
correction of situations where grazing use exceeds carrying capacity. Removing the phased implementation requirement
would not prohibit agreements or decisions that would allow phased reductions in use. The cross reference to other
methods of estimating forage production and identifying and the use of monitoring or field observations to identify
when grazing use or patterns of use are not consistent with the national requirements or standards and guidelines,
or grazing use is otherwise causing an unacceptable level or pattern of utilization, would also allow more responsive
action to improve the rangeland condition. The Department does not intend that extended monitoring would be necessary
to begin needed adjustment of use. The removal of the term ``coordination and cooperation'' would result in a more
precise statement of the requirements placed on the authorized officer. The statutory requirement of FLPMA (43 U.S.C.
1752), as amended by section 8 of the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978, for consultation, coordination,
and cooperation applies to the development, revision, and termination of allotment management plans. Existing
paragraph (c) would be redesignated as paragraph (b) and would be amended to remove the word ``temporary'' because
it implies only one season while the influences of natural events such as drought could significantly affect vegetation
health and productivity for several months or years after a drought has passed. Other minor amendments clarify the
action of the field manager and retain the special provisions for making ``emergency'' decisions effective. This
section includes changes made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend this section by revising the heading and by adding reference to other activity plans
that may prescribe grazing management. It has been the BLM's policy to develop more integrated activity plans for
managing resources of an allotment, such as coordinated resource management plans. The BLM strongly favors the development
of integrated activity plans over single purpose plans such as allotment management plans (AMPs) because integrated
plans allow BLM, permittees or lessees, and other affected persons to take a broader look at all of the management needs
of an area while still addressing actions specific to the various uses and resource conditions of the area. The proposed
rule would clarify that draft AMPs, or other draft activity plans, may be prepared by other agencies, or permittees
or lessees. In addition to the initial proposal in the advance notice, a provision has been made for the preparation
of draft allotment management plans by other interested parties. Allotment management plans or other activity plans
would not become effective until approved by the authorized officer. Paragraph (a) would be amended by replacing
the reference to district grazing advisory boards with multiple resource advisory councils and including State
resource management agencies in the activity planning process as explained above. The amendment would also provide
that plans shall include standards and guidelines that are not included as terms and conditions of the permit or lease.
The amendment would provide that flexibility granted to permittees or lessees under a plan shall be determined on
the basis of demonstrated stewardship. The requirement for earning flexibility is an incentive for cooperating
grazing operators to manage for the improvement of rangeland conditions. The proposed rule would make the inclusion
of other than public lands in an allotment management plan or other activity plan a discretionary action as opposed
to a requirement as worded in the existing regulations. Finally, this section would reference the NEPA analysis and
related public participation that is required for the planning and revision of allotment or activity plans, and would
provide that the decision document following the environmental analysis would serve as the proposed decision for
purposes of subpart 4160.

This section would be amended by inserting a new paragraph (f) addressing reviews of decisions associated with range
improvement projects. The amendment clarifies the process for administering protests and appeals of the decision
and directs appeals through the administrative remedies process (43 CFR part 4160) provided for in grazing administration.
At present, appeals of these decisions regarding range improvements go to the Interior Board of Land Appeals without
an opportunity for a local field hearing on the facts of the case as is the practice with other rangeland grazing program
decisions.

The section heading would be revised to clarify that this section deals with cooperative range improvements as opposed
to ``cooperative agreements'' with other Federal or State agencies. The proposed rule would amend this section to
make it clear that the United States would have title to all new permanent grazing-related improvements constructed
on public lands. Title to temporary grazing-related improvements used primarily for livestock handling or water
hauling could be retained by the permittee or lessee. This change conforms with the common practice of keeping title
of permanent improvements in the name of the party holding title to the land. The amendment would not change the agreements
currently in effect.

This section would be amended to make it clear that a permittee or lessee may apply for a range improvement permit to
install, use, maintain, or modify range improvement projects, whether permanent or temporary, needed to meet management
objectives established for the allotment. The permittee would hold title to removable livestock handling facilities
and to temporary improvements such as troughs for hauled water or loading chutes. The amendment would also clarify
that permanent water improvement projects would be authorized through cooperative range improvement agreements.
The proposed rule would remove the provision that permittees or lessees would control the use of ponds or wells by livestock.
Permittees and lessees would be the graziers and, therefore, would control livestock use of water sources. The proposed
amendment will not affect ownership or rights currently held in a range improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A provision was added to those presented in the advance notice to make clear that the authorized officer would retain
a record of permittee or lessee contributions to specific authorized range improvement projects. This record would
be used in determining compensation due the permittee or lessee from the BLM in the event a permit or lease is canceled
in order to devote the public lands to another public purpose, including disposal of the lands. The record would also
be considered prior to the transfer of grazing preference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would provide for the BLM to mediate disputes about reasonable compensation for the operation and maintenance
of facilities when another operator is authorized temporary use of forage that the preference permit holder cannot

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would add a new section to this part that addresses the distribution and use of the ``range betterment''
funds appropriated by Congress through section 401(b) of FLPMA for range improvement expenditure by the Secretary
of the Interior. The range betterment fund has been called the range improvement appropriation by Congress and is
known by that title in the BLM. The proposed amendment would provide for distribution of the funds by the Secretary
or designee. The proposed rule would provide that one-half of the range improvement fund would be made available to
the State and District from which the funds were derived. The remaining one-half would be allocated by the Secretary
or designee on a priority basis. All range improvement funds would be used for on-the-ground rehabilitation, protection
and improvements of public rangeland ecosystems. Current policy requires the return of all range improvement funds
to the District from which they were collected. The BLM has found this not to be in the best interest of the public because
it prevents use of the funds in areas where they are most needed and results in some offices experiencing difficulty
expending available funds efficiently. The proposed amendment would correct the imbalance by ensuring that the
funds are distributed on a priority basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would clarify that range improvement includes activities such as planning, design, layout, modification,
and monitoring/evaluating the effectiveness of specific range improvements in achieving resource condition and
management objectives. Maintenance of range improvements and costs associated with the contracting of range improvement
was added to the list of activities included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for which range improvement
funds may be used. Maintenance was an allowable use of range improvement funds prior to a policy change made in 1982.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require consultation with affected permittees, lessees, and the interested public during
the planning of range development and improvement programs. Multiple resource advisory councils would also be consulted
during the planning of range development and improvement programs, including the development of budgets for range
improvement and the establishment of range improvement priorities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section was added in response to comments on language pertaining to water rights that was presented in the advance
notice. This section would provide consistent direction for the BLM regarding water rights on public lands for livestock
watering purposes. Under the proposed rule, any new rights to water on public land for livestock watering on such land
would be acquired, perfected, maintained, and administered under State law, and in the name of the United States unless
State law prohibits it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would not create any new Federal reserved water rights, nor would it affect valid existing water rights.
Any right or claim to water on public land for livestock watering on public land by or on behalf of the United States would
remain subject to the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 666 (the McCarran Amendment) and section 701 of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701
note; disclaimer on water rights). Finally, the proposal would not change existing BLM policy on water rights for

This section would provide for field managers to make temporary changes in authorized use, either increases or decreases,
not to exceed 25 percent of the authorized use or 100 AUMs, whichever is greater, following consultation with the affected
permittees or lessees and the State having land or responsibility for resources management within the allotment.
This would provide latitude to the authorized officer for authorizing minor or incidental adjustments in grazing
use without extensive consultation, simplifying day-to-day administration. The provision for 25 percent or 100
AUMS, whichever is greater, is intended to specify what constitutes minor or incremental adjustments. The Department
proposes the 100 AUM limitation to provide sufficient latitude in cases where minor adjustments, in terms of the total
amount of forage, would constitute a large percentage of the permitted use (i.e., small permits or leases). Changes
of a temporary nature could be made in a timely manner when the proposed changes conform with the applicable land use
plan and standards and guidelines, and are within the terms and conditions of the existing permit or lease. Examples
of the types of changes that would be considered under this section are the activation of previously approved temporary
nonuse, placing permitted use in temporary nonuse, and the use of forage temporarily available on ephemeral or annual
ranges.

The permit and lease tenure proposals included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking have not been carried
forward. Public comment on the advance notice suggested the permit and lease tenure provisions would result, among
other things, in severe limitations on the ability of prospective permittees and lessees to secure financing for
the purchase and operation of ranches. Under this proposed rule, permits and leases would continue to be offered for
10-year terms except in specified circumstances.

The proposed rule would clarify that all grazing permits and leases issued, including the transfer or renewal of permits
and leases, would include terms and conditions addressing the national requirements and standards and guidelines
proposed under subpart 4180, as well as terms and conditions establishing allowable levels, seasons and duration
of use, and other terms and conditions that would assist in achieving management objectives, provide for proper range
management, or assist in the orderly administration of the public rangelands. Terms and conditions reflecting the
national requirements proposed under subpart 4180 would begin being incorporated in grazing permits and leases
as permits and leases are issued, including transfer or renewal, upon the effective date of the rule. Standards and
guidelines for grazing administration would be reflected in the terms and conditions of grazing permits and leases
upon their completion or, in the absence of the completion of State or regional standards and guidelines, as the fallback
standards and guidelines presented in section 4180.2 of this proposed rule become effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph has been added in addition to those presented in the advance notice to make clear the requirements for
consultation with interested parties prior to the issuance or renewal of grazing permits and leases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of the advance notice that would prevent the renewal of permits and leases when the permittees or lessees
are found to be in repeated noncompliance with the terms and conditions of expiring grazing permits or leases has been
removed from this section. Section 4110.1_Mandatory qualifications, would require that applicants for renewal
must be determined to be in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of their grazing permit or lease.
In assessing whether an applicant for renewal is in substantial compliance, the authorized officer would consider
the number of prior incidents of noncompliance with the requirements of 43 CFR part 4100, as well as the nature and seriousness
of any single incident of noncompliance. Therefore, a separate provision in this section is deemed to be unnecessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of the advance notice that applicants for renewal would be required to be found to not be in violation
of the provisions of 43 CFR part 4100 has been removed. Section 4170.1&hyph;1_Penalty for violations, in the existing
regulations provides for withholding issuance of permits and leases when applicants are in violation of the provisions
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of the advance notice that would prohibit the offer or grant of permits and leases when the applicant

The proposed rule clarifies the application for and granting of conservation use and temporary nonuse. Conservation
use would be established as one of the allowable uses a permittee or lessee may be granted. The existing regulations
grant the authorized officer the discretion to place forage in nonuse for conservation purposes. The change from
the term ``nonuse for conservation purposes'' to ``conservation use'' is intended to clarify that conservation
use is allowable, when in conformance with applicable land use plans, activity plans and standards and guidelines,
and will allow the Department to fulfill one of the requirements of the Taylor Grazing Act, which is to ``preserve land
and its resources from destruction or unnecessary injury'' (43 U.S.C. 315a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forage made available as a result of temporary nonuse may be authorized for temporary use by another operator. Forage
used for conservation purposes would not be available to other livestock operators. The procedures guiding approval
of nonuse are proposed in response to a recommendation from the March 19, 1986, Inspector General's review of the grazing
management program.

documented agreement or contract that includes information required for the BLM's administration of permits and
leases and management of rangeland resources. This generally does not create a new requirement. Many field offices
are currently requiring the information to document the legality of the pasturing of livestock owned by persons other

In addition to the proposals of the advance notice, this proposed rule would add an exemption from some of the requirements
for ownership of livestock for sons and daughters of permittees or lessees in specified circumstances. This modification

permit or lease in specified circumstances, from the authorized leasing or subleasing surcharge provided in &sect;4130.7.

The proposed rule would amend this section by revising the grazing fee formula, adding a provision for phasing in the
grazing fee over the years 1995 through 1997, providing for an adjustment of the fee formula in the event separate final
regulations prescribing qualification criteria for an incentive-based fee are not completed, and providing for
a 25 percent cap on changes in the calculated fee from year to year. The section would be further amended to make clear
the definition of a billing unit, to provide for assessing a surcharge for the public landlord's share of authorized
subleasing associated with Federal land grazing, to provide for multi-year billing in specified circumstances
to reduce administrative workload associated with small grazing allotments, to clarify that grazing use that occurs
before a bill is paid is an unauthorized use and may be dealt with under the settlement and penalties sections of these
regulations and may result in the limitation of flexibility authorized under an allotment management plan, and to
provide for free use where the primary objective of livestock use is to benefit resource conditions or management,
such as scientific study or the control of noxious weeds. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking proposed to phase
in the grazing fee over the grazing years of 1994 through 1996. This proposed rule would also phase in the revised grazing
fee, but the initial phase would begin with grazing year 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment of the grazing fee formula has been prepared in cooperation with the Forest Service. In reviewing
potential modification of the grazing fee formula the BLM and Forest Service identified criteria by which any new
fee proposal should be measured. Those criteria are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The fee charged for livestock grazing should approximate market value. Using market value helps assure that the
public receives a fair return for the private use of publicly owned resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The fee should not cause unreasonable impacts on communities that are not economically diverse or to livestock
operations that are greatly dependent on public land forage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The grazing fee should recover a reasonable amount of government costs involved in administering grazing permits
and leases and should provide increased funds to improve ecological conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The fee system should be understandable and reasonably easy to administer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present fee system, in effect since 1978, has been controversial and criticized for the wide disparity between
rates charged for livestock grazing on private lands and those charged for Federal lands. While the forage value in
the private market increased substantially over time, the Federal grazing fee has decreased during some periods
or had relatively small increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed fee system would use a base value adjusted annually by the change in the private grazing land lease rate.
The proposed base value was derived by using data from two different studies. The first study is the 1966 Western Livestock
Grazing Survey (WLGS), where over 10,000 individuals were interviewed to determine the costs of operating on Federal
lands, as compared to operating on private land leases. Information on the private grazing land lease rate was also
collected. The WLGS determined that the westwide value for grazing Federal lands equalled $1.23 per AUM for 1966.
This value is updated to a 1991 base value of $3.25 per AUM by multiplying $1.23 by 264, the percentage change in the private
grazing land lease rate from the base years 1964&hyph;1968, and dividing by 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second study is the 1983 appraisal of the value of grazing on the BLM and Forest Service lands in the 16 western States.
This appraisal involved interviews with approximately 100,000 persons and generated 7,246 usable records of fees
paid for livestock grazing. The appraisal divided the 16 western States into 6 pricing regions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appraisers concluded that the value of public land grazing ranged from $4.68 per head month (equivalent to BLM's
AUM for billing purposes) in the southwest pricing region to $8.55 per head month in the northern plains pricing region.
In 1992, the appraisal was updated, based on additional data for private grazing lease rates gathered during 1991.
The update found no change in the $4.68 per head month value of grazing in the southwest pricing region, and found an
increase to $10.26 per head month in the northern plains pricing region. The $4.68 appraisal value is the lowest of
the appraised values and is considered a reasonable amount on which to base a westwide fee. Using the lowest of the appraised
values would minimize the impact on livestock grazing permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would establish a new base value of $3.96 per AUM by averaging the results of the two studies ($3.25
plus $4.68 divided by 2 equals $3.96). By averaging these two values the base value is established in consideration
of the economic value of the forage and costs of production. After an initial phase-in period, the fee would be adjusted
annually by multiplying the base value by the Forage Value Index (FVI), which reflects the change in the private grazing
land lease rate in the 17 western States weighted by the number of public AUMs sold in each State. The private grazing
land lease rate estimate is prepared annually by the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service. Although the
FVI does not explicitly use indices based on production costs or on the value of the livestock produced, both of these
factors influence the prices paid for grazing livestock on private lands and, therefore, are implicit in the forage
value index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of the FVI in this proposed rule has been changed from the definition presented in the advance notice
of proposed rulemaking. In the advance notice the FVI was to be calculated by dividing the prior year weighted average
AUM price on private grazing lands in the 17 western States by the weighted average AUM price on private grazing lands
in the 17 western States during the years 1990 through 1992. That method would have established 1990 through 1992 as
the base years from which the Federal grazing fee would be indexed. Beginning in 1994, the FVI would have been used to
calculate the Federal grazing fee under the advance proposal. In this proposed rule, the concept of the FVI has been
retained but the FVI base year would be 1996 and the FVI would not be used to calculate the Federal grazing fee until 1997.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this change in the FVI base year is to address the concern that the FVI calculation proposed in the advance
notice would have resulted in adjusting the Federal grazing fee by several years' worth of change in private grazing
land lease rates, resulting in an uncertain and possibly significant jump or drop in the calculated fee. Under this
proposed rule the FVI would first be used in calculating the 1997 grazing fee and would be based on the 1996 private grazing
land lease rates in each of the 17 western States. By definition, the FVI in the year 1997 would equal one, resulting
in a 1997 grazing fee equal to the base value. In subsequent years the fee would reflect changes from the 1996 private
grazing land lease rates. The Department recognizes that basing the FVI in a single year, as opposed to the three year
average presented in the advance notice, could result in slightly greater volatility in the index. However, the Department
feels this potential volatility in the index, given the relative stability in the private grazing land lease rates
and the limitation on annual fluctuations discussed below, is overshadowed by the need to avoid some of the uncertainty
associated with an FVI based on less current data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grazing fee charged in 1994 is $1.98 per AUM. Under this proposed rule the formula would result in a grazing fee in
1997 of $3.96. The fee would be phased-in by establishing the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 fee at $3.50. Thereafter,
except as explained below, the fee would be calculated by multiplying the $3.96 base value by the FVI. After the phase-in,
the grazing fee would be allowed to change by no more than 25 percent annually, plus or minus, from the amount charged
the previous year. The phase-in and the 25 percent per year limit are intended to moderate the impact of fee changes
on livestock operations and ranching communities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two provisions have been added to the proposed rule regarding incentive-based grazing fees. First, the proposed
rule provides for a 30 percent reduction in the grazing fee to those permittees and lessees who meet the applicable
eligibility criteria to be established in a separate rule. Second, the proposed rule provides that if separate final
regulations necessary to implement the incentive-based fee are not issued prior to the start of grazing fee year 1997,
implementation of the $3.96 base value would be delayed. The Department believes that a 30 percent reduction in the
grazing fee would be a valuable tool in promoting good stewardship. However, the effectiveness of this incentive
would rest on the criteria for qualification. These criteria would focus primarily upon those permittees and lessees
who agree to participate in special rangeland improvement programs characterized by best management practices,
the furtherance of resource condition objectives, and comprehensive monitoring. The Department has not found general
agreement on the criteria necessary to qualify for the fee reduction and, accordingly, has decided to consider that
aspect of the incentive-based fee through a separate rulemaking. The proposed delay in implementation of the $3.96
base value, in the event that final rule on these criteria has not been issued, is intended to demonstrate the Department's
commitment to expeditious implementation of the incentive-based fee. The Department anticipates that eligibility
criteria would require the permittee or lessee to undertake management practices beyond those otherwise required
by law and regulation to benefit the ecological health of the public rangelands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of completed regulations establishing the criteria for qualification for the reduced fee, and beginning
in the grazing fee year 1997, a base value of $3.50 would be substituted in the formula. The $3.50 base value would continue
until such time as the incentive-based fee regulations are completed. This provision would not affect the phase-in
of the fee in the grazing fee years 1995 and 1996, or the 25 percent cap on annual changes in the calculated fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would provide for collecting a surcharge for certain authorized leasing and subleasing activities
associated with a Federal permit or lease attached to base property. It would retain the provision for legal transfer
of base leases and permits and the pasturing of livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial proposal in the advance notice has been modified to exclude from the surcharge sons and daughters of permittees
or lessees grazing livestock on public lands as part of an educational or youth programs pertaining to livestock rangeland
management, or when establishing a livestock herd in anticipation of assuming part or all of the family ranch operation.
This change was made in recognition of the public concern that the surcharge could unduly restrict opportunities
for young persons learning or entering the livestock business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of subleasing or pasturing livestock owned by others in connection with public land grazing permits or leases
has been controversial and there has been much concern expressed in the West by the livestock industry and conservation
organizations, alike. The concern is easily understood when one considers that past Federal grazing fees have been
sufficiently low as to present opportunities for substantial profit when a permittee or lessee pastures another
party's livestock or leases the base property. Also, the short-term nature of agreements for pasturing livestock
owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee presents less incentive for stewardship of the land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing an approach to address these concerns the BLM queried departments responsible for the management of
State lands in most of the western States to determine how they were addressing this issue and if they were collecting
a share of the lease or service fees being charged. The BLM found that most of the States that allow subleasing or pasturing
of livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee require the payment of a service fee or surcharge,
or a portion of the amount in excess of the State's rental fee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule the Department would recognize two types of authorized leasing or subleasing. The first is
the lease or sublease of public land grazing privileges associated with the base property. Such a lease or sublease
would be authorized so long as the associated base property is leased or subleased together with the public land grazing
privileges and the BLM authorized officer approves the arrangement. The second is a pasturing agreement under which
livestock not owned by the permittee or lessee but under the control of the permittee or lessee is allowed to graze on
the permit or lease area. In order to be authorized, such a lease or sublease arrangement would require approval of
the BLM authorized officer. Other types of subleasing arrangements would be unauthorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing to charge a surcharge of 20 percent on all grazing fee billings for the authorized lease
or sublease of public land grazing privileges associated with base property. An analysis of the costs and prices indicates
that a 20 percent surcharge as applied by the State of New Mexico, the lowest of the States charging for subleasing,
would be appropriate and is consistent with the approach used by other western States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also proposes to follow the example of the western States subleasing charges to establish a surcharge
for authorized leasing or subleasing arrangements constituting pasturing agreements, as described above. The
Department proposes a surcharge of 50 percent for the forage used in pasturing livestock owned by other than the permittee
or lessee under a BLM permit or lease where the livestock is under the control of the BLM permittee or lessee. This figure
is comparable to the $1.00 per AUM sublease fee charged by the State of Utah and would capture the typically larger profit
associated with pasturing livestock. The surcharge would be 70 percent of the grazing bill when there is both an authorized
lease or sublease of grazing preference and an authorized pasturing agreement. Sons and daughters of permittees
and lessees would be provided with an exemption from the surcharges under circumstances specified in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule includes a provision for multiple-year billing of grazing fees. This provision was not included
in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. It has been added in response to preliminary analyses of Rangeland Reform
'94 that suggested a need to identify further opportunity for reductions in administrative expense and staffing
needs. The proposed rule would allow the authorized officer to approve advance billing for up to 5 years where agreed
to by the permittee or lessee and where annual authorized livestock use does not exceed 200 AUMs. At the end of the billing
period or prior to any termination or transfer of the permit or lease, a separate billing would be issued to reconcile
amounts owed or overpaid as a result of changes in the grazing fee. This provision focuses on smaller public land leases
that result in disproportionately high administrative costs. Multiple-year billing would free limited staff and
resources to work on higher priority resource concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new provisions for free use provide for the authorized officer to approve free use under limited circumstances.
Under this section, free use could be permitted where the primary objective of authorized grazing use or conservation
use is the management of vegetation to meet resource objectives other than the production of livestock forage, to
conduct scientific research or administrative studies, or to control noxious weeds.

Existing &sect;&sect;4130.7&hyph;2 and 4130.7&hyph;3 would be redesignated as &sect;&sect;4130.7&hyph;3 and
4130.7&hyph;4, respectively, and a new section 4130.7&hyph;2 would be added to provide for the calculation of the
incentive-based grazing fee and the criteria for qualifying for the fee reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section would provide for a 30 percent reduction in the grazing fee where the criteria for qualification are met.
However, the criteria for qualification are not included in this proposed rule. The Department intends to use its
best efforts to complete a separate rule that will establish the criteria prior to the start of the 1996 grazing fee
year, and has reserved a paragraph for the criteria in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section would provide that the incentive-based fee for qualifying applicants in the grazing year 1996 would
be calculated by multiplying the base value of $3.96 times 0.70 (70 percent). This would yield a 1996 incentive-based
fee of $2.77. Beginning in grazing fee year 1997, the incentive-based fee would be calculated by multiplying the base
value of $3.96 times the FVI and 0.70. This calculation would again yield an incentive-based fee of $2.77 for the grazing
fee year 1997 because the FVI, by definition, would equal one for grazing fee year 1997. In subsequent years the incentive-based
fee would fluctuate in keeping with changes in the private grazing land lease rate as reflected by the FVI. Yearly increases
and decreases would be limited to no more than 25 percent of the incentive-based fee in the prior year.

Section 4130.7&hyph;3 would be amended by redesignating the section as &sect;4130.7&hyph;4, and by adding applications
that are made solely for temporary nonuse or conservation use. The service fee would offset the costs of processing
such applications.

Section 4140.1&blank;Prohibited Acts on Public Lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of this section would be amended to end misunderstandings about approved temporary nonuse and failure
to make substantial use as authorized. Once temporary nonuse is approved, it becomes an authorized action and is therefore
not subject to penalty action under &sect;4170.1. Other proposed amendments to this section would clarify paragraph
(b)(1) to establish that the receipt of a grazing fee bill does not authorize grazing use of the range until the bill
is paid. Paragraph (b)(9) would be amended to make it clear that the permittee is responsible for controlling livestock
so they do not stray on to ``closed to range'' areas where grazing is prohibited by local laws, such as ``formally designated
agriculture districts'' or municipalities. To be consistent with the Forest Service this section would restore
two provisions that existed in this subpart prior to 1984. These provisions would make subject to penalty permittee
or lessee violations of the Wild and Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971, the Endangered Species Act, and Federal
or State laws or regulations concerning pest or animal damage control, and conservation or protection of natural
and cultural resources or environmental quality when public lands are involved or affected. Under &sect;4170.1&hyph;3,
no action could be taken in response to violations of State and Federal laws pertaining to pest or animal damage control,
and conservation or protection of natural and cultural resources or environmental quality unless the permittee
or lessee is convicted or otherwise determined by the appropriate authority to have been in violation, and there are
no outstanding appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several changes were made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to enable BLM
law enforcement personnel to assist in protection of authorized use of the public lands and to clarify the various
acts committed against grazing animals. In addition some changes have been made to make clear that attempted payment
by a check that is not honored by the bank does not constitute payment and would result in unauthorized use, and to provide
for reclamation of lands, property or resources when damaged by unauthorized use or actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of the types of violations of Federal and State laws and regulations concerning pest or predator control and
conservation or protection of natural and cultural resources or the environment that would be prohibited acts where
public lands are involved or affected has been added in this proposed rule. This change was made in response to comments
on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking that suggested that this provision needed to be more explicit.

This section would be amended to grant the authorized officer authority and provide for determining if a nonwillful
violation is incidental in nature, and to clarify actions for expedient resolution of these innocent or unintended
trespasses. The ability to close areas for a period of up to 12 months to specified class and kinds of livestock for the
sole purpose of abating unauthorized use was added in addition to the changes presented in the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking. Reference to the agents of livestock owners has also been added. These changes will facilitate the process
of identifying and removing unauthorized livestock from public rangelands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be amended to provide guidelines for considering nonmonetary settlement that waives fees for
unintentional incidental trespasses in a fair manner while preventing needless expense in the best interest of the
public. Key provisions of determination would be: the operator is not at fault, an insignificant amount of forage
is consumed, no damage occurred, and nonmonetary settlement is in the best interest of the United States. The method
for determining the settlement amounts would be amended to base the value of forage on the monthly rate per AUM for pasturing
livestock on private, nonirrigated land in the 17 western States. This section includes changes made in addition
to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to reduce the potential for abuse of discretion by
clarifying when a nonmonetary settlement for nonwillful violations may be made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend this section to improve organization, clarify the process and requirements, and to
provide for application of the Departmental rule located at section 4.21 of this title regarding full force and effect
decisions and petitions for staying the effect of a decision pending determination on appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4160.1&blank;Proposed Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be amended to provide clarification that a final decision may be issued without first issuing a
proposed decision when action under paragraph 4110.3&hyph;3(b) of this part is necessary to stop resource damage,
or when action is taken under paragraph 4150.2(d) to close an area to unauthorized grazing use. This proposed amendment
does not limit appeal rights provided in &sect;4160.3. It would serve to expedite the decision process where immediate
action is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section includes changes made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to
clarify, primarily, what information must be contained in a proposed decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4160.3&blank;Final Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be amended to clarify the process for filing an appeal and a petition for a stay of the decision. Under
the proposed rule, decisions would be implemented at the end of the 30-day appeal period except where a petition for
stay has been filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, in which case the Office of Hearings and Appeals has, under
&sect;4.21 of this title, a period of 45 days from the end of the appeal period in which to decide on the petition for stay.
This process would temporarily stay the decision up to 75 days if a stay is not granted. A stay, if granted, would suspend
the effect of the decision pending final disposition of the appeal. Under the present grazing administration appeals
process, decisions other than those pertaining to emergency action are automatically stayed upon the timely filing
of an appeal. This has resulted in delays of up to two years before necessary corrective action can be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would protect the public's rights to an appeal and would provide a method for staying decisions where
the Office of Hearings and Appeals determines it would be appropriate to do so. At the same time this section would prevent
unnecessary delays in action. The advance notice stated that when no protest is received on a proposed decision it
shall become the final decision and will be appealable for a period of 30 days. Clarification of the wording relating
to this point in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking has been made in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions would make 43 CFR part 4100 more consistent with the Department's &sect;4.21 of this title.
Several changes were made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to make clear
how the Departmental rule would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also clarifies the amount of grazing use that would be allowable when a decision has been stayed by
the Office of Hearings and Appeals or by order of a Federal Court. Where an appellant had no authorized grazing use the
preceding year, the authorized grazing use would be required to be consistent with the decision pending a final determination
on appeal. Appellants affected by this provision would include persons that are applicants for permit or lease transfers.
Where a decision proposes to change the amount of authorized grazing use, the permitted grazing use would remain at
no more than the appellant's previously determined permitted use during the time an appeal is pending. Reference
to ephemeral use has been added to the amendments included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking which pertain
to levels of use pending determination on appeal. This amendment would provide for making decisions immediately
effective when it is necessary to protect the rangeland resources or to facilitate abatement of unauthorized use
by closing an area to grazing use under sections 4110.3&hyph;3 and 4150.2 of this part.

This section would be amended to make it clear that any party whose interest is adversely affected may appeal the final
decision of the authorized officer. The amendment would also provide instructions regarding the filing of appeals
and petitions to stay decisions. When a final decision is issued, all parties whose interests have been adversely
affected may file an appeal and a petition for stay of the decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of a final decision,
or 30 days from the date a proposed decision becomes final in the absence of a protest. Under the process of &sect;4.21
of this title, the Office of Hearings and Appeals would be allowed 45 days from the end of the appeal period to review
the petition and issue a determination. A decision would not be in effect during the consideration of a petition for
stay unless it was made effective for reasons under &sect;4110.3&hyph;3(b) or 4150.2(d) of this subpart. The determination
of who qualifies as an affected party is made by OHA.

times the private grazing land lease rate for the 17 western States as supplied annually by the National Agricultural
Statistics Service, and all reasonable expenses incurred by the United States in detecting, investigating, and
resolving the violation. This penalty would be more consistent with the penalties provided for unauthorized use
and would be simpler to administer than the penalty provided in the existing regulations. This provision was not included

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be amended to clarify the consultation requirements when considering taking action to cancel,
in whole or in part, a permit or lease in response to failure to use, and to clarify that the failure to make substantial
grazing use as authorized means the failure to make active grazing use as approved on a grazing use authorization.
Permittees and lessees would be required to apply and receive approval for nonuse or conservation use. This section
also would include failure to maintain or use water base property in the grazing operation. The failure to make authorized
use may result in monitoring studies providing false information which could cause decisions to overobligate the
forage resource of the rangeland. The failure to apply for conservation use or nonuse prevents the BLM from having
an opportunity to determine if conservation use or nonuse is in conformance with applicable plans and if it will aid
in achieving resource condition objectives. Review by the authorized officer of applications for nonuse is also
necessary to determine if forage left unused should be allocated to another party through a temporary permit. Finally,
water property is crucial to the proper use and operation of livestock grazing in water base areas. If base property
waters are not kept in serviceable condition, livestock are forced to overuse the service areas of the remaining waters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart would be added to establish national requirements for the administration of grazing on public lands.
It would also include a provision for the development of State or regional standards and guidelines for grazing administration.
These requirements, standards, and guidelines are proposed to establish clear direction for managing rangelands
in a manner that would achieve or maintain ecological health, including the protection of habitats of threatened
or endangered species and candidate species, and the protection of water quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new section would establish national requirements for grazing administration on public rangelands. The national
requirements would include the requirement for maintaining or achieving healthy, properly functioning ecosystems
and riparian areas and instituting measures to further the purposes of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All grazing-related actions on public lands would be required to conform with the national requirements. Where
the national requirements are not being met, the authorized officer would be required to take corrective action prior
to the start of the next grazing season. This would include actions such as reducing livestock stocking rates, adjusting
the season or duration of livestock use, or modifying or relocating range improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in the national requirements relating to riparian systems would be construed to create a water right based

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new section would establish the requirements for the development of standards and guidelines, and guiding principles
for the development of standards and guidelines for grazing administration on public lands. All grazing related
actions within the affected area would be required to conform with the standards and guidelines. The geographical
area to be covered by the standards and guidelines developed pursuant to this section would be determined by the BLM
State Director. Standards and guidelines would be required to be developed for an entire State, or for an ecoregion
including portions of more than one State, except where the geophysical or vegetal character of an area is unique and
the health of the rangelands could not be ensured by using standards and guidelines developed for a larger geographical
area. The preparation of standards and guidelines would involve public participation and consultation with multiple
resource advisory councils, Indian tribes, and Federal agencies responsible for the management of lands within
the affected area. Public participation would include the involvement of the interested public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would establish guiding principles to be addressed in the development of standards and guidelines.
The guiding principles for standards to be developed pertain to the minimum soil, water and vegetation conditions
required for rangeland ecosystem health. All standards for grazing administration would be required to address
factors relating to soil stability and watershed function, the distribution of nutrients and energy, and the recovery
mechanisms of plant communities and riparian functioning conditions. The proposed guiding principles for the development
of guidelines for grazing administration pertain to the types of management actions necessary to ensure that the
standards can be met. Included in these guiding principles are the requirements that State or regional guidelines
address grazing practices to be implemented to benefit threatened or endangered species and candidate species,
and to maintain, restore or enhance water quality; critical periods of plant growth or regrowth and the need for rest
from livestock grazing; situations in which continuous season-long grazing, or use of ephemeral rangelands, could
be authorized; the allowable types and location of certain range improvements and management practices; and utilization
or residual vegetation limits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides that where State or regional standards and guidelines are not developed within 18 months
of the effective date of the proposed rule, fallback standards and guidelines included in the text of the rule would
be implemented. The fallback standards address the same factors relating to soil stability and watershed function,
the distribution of nutrients and energy, the recovery mechanisms of plant communities, and riparian functioning
condition as provided for under the guiding principles. However, the fallback standards include more detail as to
the conditions that would exist under each of the factors when rangelands are in healthy, functional condition. Under
the fallback standards, rangelands would be measured against benchmarks for the presence and development of top
soils, evidence of active soil erosion, distribution of plants and nutrients in both space and time, distribution
of plant litter, rooting throughout the available soil profile, the growth forms of plants, plant vigor, the presence
of a range of age classes for the vegetation on site, presence and development of flood plains, and channel sinuosity,
width-to-depth ratio, and gradient in relation to the landscape setting. Individual sites may be in healthy, functional
condition even though they do not meet all of these measures; however, the Department feels that generally failing
to meet the benchmarks across an area the size of a typical grazing pasture or allotment would be reliable evidence
that the specific area is not in healthy, functional condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fallback guidelines for grazing administration would restrict management practices to those activities that assist
in or do not hinder meeting certain legal mandates and achieving or maintaining rangeland health. The fallback guidelines
address the same types of actions and practices that are considered under the guiding principles for the development
of State or regional guidelines, but present these actions and practices as guidance for management. The fallback
guidelines include the requirement that grazing management practices be implemented that assist in or do not hinder
the recovery of threatened or endangered species, or assist in, or do not hinder, preventing the listing of species
identified as candidates for threatened or endangered species. The fallback guidelines would also require that
grazing practices be implemented that would assist in attaining and protecting water quality consistent with the
Clean Water Act. Other fallback guidelines would require that grazing schedules include periods of rest during times
of critical plant growth or regrowth, limit the authorization of continuous season-long grazing to instances where
it has been demonstrated to be consistent with achieving or maintaining rangeland health and meeting established
resource objectives. Spring developments or other projects affecting water would be required to be designed to protect
the ecological values of the affected sites. Livestock management practices or management facilities would generally
be required to be located outside of riparian-wetland areas, and where standards for these areas are not being met,
the facilities could be removed or relocated, or the management practices modified. The fallback guidelines would
also require the establishment and application of utilization or residual vegetation targets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fallback standards and guidelines could be tailored by the BLM State Director better to fit local ecosystems and management
practices. Modifications of the fallback standards and guidelines would require the approval of the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards and guidelines would be adhered to in the development of grazing-related portions of activity plans, and
would be reflected in permits and leases as terms and conditions. Where data, including field observations, found
acceptable to the authorized officer indicate that the standards and guidelines are not being met, the authorized
officer would be required to take appropriate action, such as adjusting numbers, seasons, or duration of use by livestock,
or modifying other management practices or range improvements, as soon as practicable but not later than the start
of the next grazing year. Standards and guidelines would not be implemented prior to approval by the Secretary.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has prepared an initial Small Entities Flexibility Assessment analyzing the economic impact of this
rulemaking on small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The initial assessment found that although some marginally profitable small livestock businesses that are highly
dependent on public land grazing could experience significant economic impacts, most small businesses, organizations,
and governments would not experience significant economic effects. The initial assessment is available at the address
provided above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12630, the Attorney General Guidelines, Department of
the Interior Guidelines, and the Attorney General Supplemental Guidelines to determine the takings implications
of the proposed rule if it were promulgated as currently drafted. Because the relevant statutes and regulations governing
grazing on Federal land and case law interpreting said statutes and regulations have consistently recognized grazing
on Federal land as a revocable license and not a property interest, it has been determined that this proposed rule does
not present a risk of a taking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards
provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collections of information contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

district except when the relevant Bureau of Land Management State Director determines one or more of the following
conditions exist:

effective participation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The configuration and character of the public lands and resources, and the juxtaposition of these lands and resources
to affected communities, are such that a separate multiple resource advisory council for each Bureau of Land Management
district in which the lands are situated is not the most effective means for obtaining consensual advice for the management

Following consultation with the affected lessees or permittees, other landowners involved, the interested public,
and States having lands or responsibility for managing resources within the affected area, the authorized officer
may modify terms and conditions of the permit or lease when the present grazing use is not meeting the land use plan,
AMP or other activity plan, or management objectives, or is not in conformance with the national requirements or the
standards and guidelines. To the extent practical, the authorized officer shall provide to affected permittees
or lessees, States having lands or responsibility for managing resources within the affected area, and the interested
public an opportunity to review, comment and give input during the preparation of reports that evaluate monitoring
and other data that are used as a basis for making decisions to increase or decrease grazing use, or to change the terms
and conditions of a permit or lease.

(a) Grazing fees shall be established annually by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, and &sect;4130.7&hyph;2, the grazing
fee per AUM shall be equal to the $3.96 base value multiplied by the Forage Value Index computed annually from private
grazing land lease rate data supplied by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forage Value Index (FVI) = the weighted average of the prior year's private grazing land lease rate per AUM for pasturing
cattle on private rangelands in each of the 17 contiguous western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington,
and Wyoming) divided by the weighted average of the private grazing land lease rate per AUM for pasturing cattle in
the year 1996 in each of the 17 contiguous western States. The weighted averages are calculated by multiplying the
private grazing land lease rate for each of the 17 States by the number of public AUMs sold on public lands, National
Forests and National Grasslands in each of the States during the respective years and dividing by the total number
of public AUMs sold in the 17 western States in the respective years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and &sect;4130.7&hyph;2, the fee shall be phased in over
the years 1995 through 1997 as follows:

Beginning in the year 1998 and thereafter the fee shall be computed using the grazing fee formula specified in paragraph
(a)(1) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the absence of the issuance of criteria pertaining to qualification for the incentive-based fee reduction
provided in &sect;4130.7&hyph;2(b), and beginning with the start of grazing year 1997, a base value of $3.50 shall
be substituted in the formula provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the grazing fee shall be calculated
as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning in the year 1998, and until the first grazing year after the issuance of final regulations prescribing criteria
for qualifying for an incentive based fee become effective, the grazing fee shall be computed using the formula specified
in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any annual increase or decrease in the grazing fee occurring after the 3-year phase-in shall be limited to not more
than 25 percent of the fee in the previous year.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the full fee shall be charged for each animal unit month of authorized
grazing use. For the purposes of calculating the fee, an animal unit month is defined as a month's use and occupancy
of range by one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, mule, 5 sheep, or 5 goats, over the age of 6 months at the time of
entering the public lands or other lands administered by BLM; for all such weaned animals regardless of age; and for
such animals that will become 12 months of age during the authorized period of use. No charge shall be made for animals
under 6 months of age, at the time of entering public lands or other lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management,
that are the natural progeny of animals upon which fees are paid, provided they will not become 12 months of age during
the authorized period of use, nor for progeny born during that period. In calculating the billing the grazing fee is
prorated on a daily basis and charges are rounded to reflect the nearest whole number of AUMs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A surcharge shall be added to the grazing fee billings for authorized leasing of base property to which public land
grazing preference is attached, or for authorized grazing of livestock owned by persons other than the permittee
or lessee except where such use is made by livestock owned by sons and daughters of permittees and lessees as provided
in &sect;4130.5(f). The surcharge shall be over and above any other fees that may be charged for using public land forage.
Surcharges shall be paid prior to grazing use being made as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 20 percent of the grazing bill for the permitted grazing use that is attached to a leased base property by an approved
transfer, or that was leased and attached to another party's base property through an approved transfer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 50 percent of the grazing bill for pasturing livestock owned by persons other than the permittee or lessee under
a grazing authorization; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 70 percent of the grazing bill when base property is leased and a transfer has been approved and livestock owned
by persons other than the permittee or lessee are pastured under a grazing authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The authorized officer may bill in advance for multiple-year grazing use based on the grazing fee in the initial
year of such authorization, the results of annual fluctuations in the fee to be reconciled through a supplemental
billing at the end of the billing period, when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The permittee or lessee has agreed to multiple-year billing;
