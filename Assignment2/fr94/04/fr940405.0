<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866 and has been determined not to be a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information complied by USDA, it has been determined that this final rule: (1) Would
have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposed rule was published on June 15, 1993, with respect to the debt management practices of the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service (ASCS). This final rule adopts, with minor changes, the provisions of the proposed rule.
Accordingly, this final rule sets forth the policies and procedures which ASCS will use to settle debts. ASCS policies
and procedures conform to the guidelines set forth in the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended by the Debt Collection
Act of 1982. ASCS will also follow the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards with respect to administrative
actions undertaken by ASCS to settle claims. This regulation is necessary to protect the financial integrity of many
Federal agricultural programs by ensuring the Government will be able to collect, or otherwise settle, debts owed
it by any person, organization, corporation, or other legal entity.

This action will not have a significant impact specifically upon area and community development; therefore, review

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (the Act), as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3711, et
seq.), and the joint regulations promulgated thereunder by the Comptroller General and the Attorney General (4 CFR
parts 101&hyph;105) provide minimum standards for the administrative collection of claims by the United States.
The Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS) require each Federal agency to take aggressive action to collect
debts owed it, and to cooperate with other Federal agencies in their debt collection activities. Federal agencies
are required to promulgate regulations consistent with the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, ASCS follows the Department of Agriculture's debt collection procedures at 7 CFR part 3. However, 7 CFR
part 3 provides that the head of any agency of the Department may adopt separate regulations to be followed for the collection
of claims and debts. ASCS requires separate regulations for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In order to make ASCS regulations consistent with Commodity Credit Corporation's debt settlement policies and
procedures at 7 CFR part 1403 to the extent that it would not conflict with the Act or the FCCS, such as providing for hearings
and reviews to our National Appeals Division; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In order to set our priority for collecting debt by offset; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In order to allow ASCS to depart from 7 CFR part 3 in those areas where it would not conflict with the Act or the FCCS,
such as the requirement in 7 CFR part 3 to send notice by personal delivery or certified mail; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To allow any amendments or revisions necessitated by statutory or program changes to be made at the agency level
rather than the departmental level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is necessary to protect the financial integrity of many Federal agricultural programs by ensuring
the Government will be able to collect, or otherwise settle, debts owed it by any person, organization, corporation,
or other legal entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received in response to the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 15, 1993 (58 FR 33029). The first commenter questioned why ASCS failed to address the use of alternative dispute
resolution, as required by Pub. L. 101&hyph;552. Pub. L. 101&hyph;552 requires the Secretary of Agriculture, with
respect to each program under the Secretary's jurisdiction that makes, guarantees, or insures agricultural loans,
to prescribe rules requiring each such program to participate in State agricultural loan mediation programs. However,
since ASCS does not make, guarantee or insure agricultural loans, this provision does not apply to it. Rules governing
mediation of Commodity Credit Corporation agricultural loan programs administered by ASCS employees to which this
provision does apply are contained in 7 CFR part 1405. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also objects to the provision of 7 CFR 792.8 which provides that all debts due ASCS or CCC may be offset
without regard to assignments which may have been filed. This provision was developed to increase the ability of ASCS
and CCC to recoup delinquent debts and to deter the circumvention of offset by such practices as the assignment of payments
to friends, relatives, partners, or subsidiary corporations. Taking an assignment of an ASCS or CCC program payment
as security for a debt has never been without risk. There has always been the possibility that a payment will not be made,
e.g., if a producer fails to comply with contract requirements. Therefore, it was determined that any heightened
risk to lenders is outweighed by the benefit to the Government in the increased ability to collect delinquent debts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further takes exception to the provision in 7 CFR 792.10(b) which states that ASCS will assess late
payment interest on the full amount of delinquent debts, which means the sum of the principal, accrued program interest
and any other charges which are due and owing at the time the late payment interest is assessed. The commenter states
that this provision is illegal under North Dakota law and has the effect of charging a rate in excess of that which is
disclosed to the borrower. Since ASCS programs are not loan programs, debts due ASCS are not based on amounts borrowed.
Instead they are generally based on failure to comply with contract provisions. Further, agencies of the Federal

This commenter states that provisions of 7 CFR 792.7, which provide for administrative offset prior to the completion
of due process requirements in certain circumstances, have the effect of ``swallowing'' due process. The commenter
also states that payments should be withheld rather than offset during the period before due process is completed.
The language referred to in 7 CFR 792.7 is taken from the Federal Claims Collection Standards with which agencies are
required to be consistent. In addition, taking offset prior to completion of due process requirements does not negate
any rights which the debtor has. Due process requirements still must be completed. Further, there is no benefit to
the debtor in ``withholding'' payment rather than offsetting payment. In either case, the debtor does not have use
of the funds. In fact by offsetting payment and applying it to the debt, rather than merely holding the payment, the
debtor is ensured that any interest assessment will be stopped. If when due process is completed it is determined that
the debtor does not owe the debt, the offset payment will be returned to the debtor, with prompt payment interest when
applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this commenter made several broad policy suggestions which were not within the scope of these regulations.
These suggestions will not be responded to in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second commenter also expressed concern that the provisions of 7 CFR 792.7 which permit offset prior to completion
of all due process requirements would negate the due process requirements. As stated above, that is not the case. Due
process requirements do not stop because offset is taken. They are still required to be completed in the same time periods
regardless of whether or not offset has been taken. This commenter also needed clarification regarding the difference
between the cited provision for accelerated offset and the provisions for withholding at 7 CFR 792.9. Withholding
is a temporary action and monies withheld are not actually credited to the debtor. It is generally used when the amount
due is uncertain. Under accelerated offset, the payment is actually applied to the debt. As stated above, this will
ensure that any interest which may be accruing is stopped. This is more difficult to ensure in cases of withholding
since in most cases, because the amount due is uncertain, there is no recorded debt to which to apply the payment.

the debtor. If the debt is not paid in full by the date specified in the initial demand letter, or if a repayment schedule
acceptable to ASCS has not been arranged with the debtor, the initial demand may be followed by two subsequent written
demands at approximately 30-day intervals, unless it is determined by ASCS that further demands would be futile and
the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial or subsequent demand letters shall specify the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The basis for and the amount of the debt determined to be due ASCS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the principal, applicable interest, costs, and other charges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a late payment interest rate is not specified in the contract, agreement or program regulation, the debtor
shall be informed of the applicable late payment interest rate set out in &sect;792.10.

period of time, by administrative offset from any CCC or ASCS payments due or to become due to the debtor, and that the
claim may be reported to other agencies of the Federal government for offset from any amounts due or to become due to
the debtor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) ASCS' intent, if applicable, under &sect;792.17, to report any delinquent debt to a credit reporting agency no

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) ASCS' intent, if applicable, under &sect;792.19, to refer any delinquent debt to the IRS, no sooner than 60 days
from the date of the letter, to be considered for offset against any tax refund due or to become due the debtor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When ASCS deems it necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate
actions.

and administrative costs, in full, whenever feasible whether the debt is being collected by administrative offset
or by another method, including voluntary payment. If a debt is paid in one lump sum after the due date, ASCS will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Payments in installments may be arranged, at ASCS' discretion, if a debtor furnishes satisfactory evidence of
inability to pay a claim in full by the specified date. The size and frequency of installment payments shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as otherwise determined by ASCS, no installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits
a certified financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial
statement shall not be required to be submitted sooner than 15 workdays following its request by ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and require the payment of interest at the late payment
interest rate in effect on the date such agreement is executed, unless such interest is waived or reduced by ASCS. The
installment agreement shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for accelerating the
debt in the event the debtor defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered,
the debtor may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by executing a security agreement and financing
agreement which provides ASCS a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to ASCS, ASCS may allow the debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary
installment payment is to be applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a voluntary installment
or partial payment, the payment will be applied to such debts as determined by ASCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Cases in which ASCS must adjust, by increasing or decreasing, a payment which is to be paid under a contract in order
to properly make other payments due by ASCS; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any case in which a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the debt
for the type of debt involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Debts due ASCS or CCC may be collected by administrative offset from amounts payable by ASCS when: (1) The debtor
has been provided written notification of the basis and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make
payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of the right to pursue an administrative appeal
in accordance with part 780 of this chapter or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not previously provided;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to inspect and copy the records of ASCS related to the debt;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The debtor has been given the opportunity to enter into a written agreement which is acceptable to ASCS for repayment
of the debt; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt will be collected by administrative offset if not paid; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by
an applicable period of limitation, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts payable by ASCS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of ASCS or the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of a contract or a violation of ASCS program requirements,
and offset is considered necessary by ASCS to protect the financial interests of the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) ASCS may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures
required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if: (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially
prejudice ASCS' ability to collect the debt; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) (1) Judgments in favor of the United States may be offset against any amounts payable by ASCS based on information
provided by or obtained from the Department of Justice. Debts due any agency other than ASCS which have not been reduced
to judgment shall be offset against amounts payable by ASCS to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government has submitted
a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-delivered to the appropriate ASCS State office, Kansas City Financial
Management Office, Kansas City Management Office, or Kansas City Commodity Office. Such written request must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Bear the signature of an authorized representative of the requesting agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Include a certification that all requirements of the law and the regulations for collection of the debt and for
requesting offset have been complied with; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) State the name, address (including county), and, where legally available, the Social Security number or employer
ID number of the debtor, and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including identification of the judgment,
if any; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest,
if any, shall be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount to be offset shall not exceed the principal
sum owed by the debtor, plus interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment interest, penalties
and administrative costs that have been assessed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order
of the bankruptcy court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact person within the agency and the address to which payment
should be sent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right
of the agency to recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, or may withdraw a request for
offset. Notice of such action must be sent to the appropriate ASCS office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g)(1) After ASCS has complied with the provisions of this part, ASCS may request other agencies of the Government
to offset amounts payable by them to persons indebted to ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the provisions at &sect;792.19 shall apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) (1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of priority without regard to the date of the request
for such collection: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Debts to ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, ASCS may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order
of priority in applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered to be in the Government's best
interest. Such decision shall be made by ASCS based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Amounts recovered by offset for ASCS and CCC debts but later found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly
refunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor of any right he or she might otherwise have to contest
the debt involved in the offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be taken against amounts payable to a debtor who operates
under more than one name, provided there is identical ownership, or ASCS determines that the debtor has established
an entity for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the claim or debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated amount of the debt, including interest, administrative
charges, and penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger specified amount be offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) Offset action will not be taken against payments when: (1) A debt has been discharged as provided in &sect;792.16.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ASCS determines such action will unduly interfere with the administration of an ASCS or CCC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal action to enforce the debt due ASCS is barred by an applicable
period of limitation, whichever is later.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No amounts payable to a debtor by ASCS shall be paid to an assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed
by the debtor except as provided in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this title by execution of Form CCC&hyph;36 shall be
subject to offset for any debt owed to ASCS or CCC or any judgment in favor of the United States without regard to the date
notice of assignment was accepted by ASCS or CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this title by execution of Form CCC&hyph;252 shall be
offset: (1) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of the applicable ASCS office prior to the filing
of such form with ASCS or CCC, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with ASCS or CCC, if the debt which is the basis for the offset
arises from a judgment in favor of the United States, or under the same contract under which the payment is earned by
the assignor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made of any amounts due any other Federal agency which
have not been reduced to judgment, and which are entered on the debt record of the appropriate ASCS office prior to the
date the notice of assignment was accepted by ASCS or CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be
available for offset.

Withholding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable
to a debtor by ASCS to ensure that the interests of ASCS and the United States will be protected as provided in this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of ASCS or the United States only if ASCS determines that: (1)
There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of program requirements and the withholding action is considered
necessary to protect the financial interests of ASCS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or
civil frauds action is of primary importance to program operations of ASCS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor
are not withheld; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a judgment on the claim of ASCS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The facts available to ASCS are insufficient to determine the amount to be offset or the proper payee;

(7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.

may not be made unless requested by the Department of Justice.

Late payment interest, penalty and administrative charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall
be charged to the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or contract either prohibits the charging of such interest
or specifies the interest or charges applicable to the debt involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the late payment interest is waived by ASCS in accordance with &sect;792.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To administrative charges as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ASCS will assess late payment interest on the full amount of delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the
term ``full amount of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued program interest, and any other
charges which are otherwise due and owing to ASCS on the delinquent debt at the time the late payment interest is assessed,
except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate of interest which ASCS charges on delinquent debts.
The late payment interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's current value of funds rate
or the rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs (d)(1)
and (d)(2) of this section. The rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment Act was chosen as an alternative
rate to ensure that the Government would recoup interest at a rate which was at least as high as that which it pays for
late payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract, or other agreement with specific provisions for
late payment interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of the debt from the first
day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise provided by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, contract, or agreement containing specific provisions
for late payment interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to accrue from the date on which notice
of the debt, including notice of late payment interest, is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except
when a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement. ASCS may then set a new rate
of interest which reflects the late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is executed. All charges
which accrued, but which were not collected under the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid
under a new repayment agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a daily basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a penalty charge of three (3) percent per annum will be
assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid ninety (90) days after the date described in paragraph (d)(1)
or (d)(2) of this section, if no repayment schedule satisfactory to ASCS has been agreed upon. Such penalty charge
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began to accrue and applied on a daily basis. Such
rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) ASCS shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs of processing delinquent debts against the
debtor, to the extent such costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are not limited to, costs
incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing contractors
for collection services, costs of selling collateral or property to satisfy the debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments will be applied first to administrative charges,
second to the penalty charge assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and late payment interest,
and third to outstanding principal.

(a) ASCS shall waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges on a debt or any portion of
a debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment interest began to accrue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ASCS may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion of the penalty charge on debts which are appealed
in accordance with 7 CFR part 780 or other applicable appeal procedures from either the date of the appeal or the date
such interest began to accrue, whichever is later, until the date a final administrative determination is issued.
Such waiver shall not apply for any delay due to:

If the opportunity to appeal the determination has not previously been provided under part 24 of this title or part

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order Nos. 916 and 917 (7 CFR parts 916 and 917) regulating
the handling of nectarines and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the orders. The orders are
effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA
is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines
and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000.
A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended that the handling requirements for California nectarines
be revised, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended that the handling requirements for California peaches
be revised. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on
a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the
public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations
and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or
termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Regulatory Periods (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;916.350, California Nectarine Container and Pack Regulation (7 CFR 916.350), fresh nectarine shipments
are regulated by container and pack during the period April 15 through October 31 each year. Under &sect;916.356,
California Nectarine Grade and Size Regulation (7 CFR 916.356, as amended at 58 FR 8534, February 16, 1993, and 58 FR
29099, May 19, 1993), fresh nectarine shipments are also regulated by grade, maturity, and size, during the period
April 15 through October 31 each year. These regulations are effective on a continuing basis subject to amendment,
modification, or suspension by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends paragraph (a) in &sect;916.350 and paragraph (a) in &sect;916.356 to change the regulatory periods
in each of these sections to April 1 through October 31 each year, so that all nectarine shipments made each season are
covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (a)(7) of &sect;916.356 is revised to change
the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh nectarines
during the April 1_April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The NAC unanimously recommended this change.

Container and Pack Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.350 specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;916.350 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of nectarines in
a 16-pound sample for each tray-pack size designation. This rule revises paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350
by modifying Table 1 to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and
adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these revised container marking requirements for nectarines after a comprehensive review of
the appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled
containers for all nectarine varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different
varieties of fruit during the course of the season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises &sect;916.350 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises &sect;916.356 by redesignating
current paragraph (b) as (c) and adding a new paragraph (b) to that section. These revisions specify the procedure
to be used in determining whether nectarines meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category
in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirements. Under this procedure, a sample consisting of one-half
of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample
weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half
a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum
size requirements on the basis of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must be used to determine if the fruit meets minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of nectarines could be adequately
determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce
inspection time and inspection costs.

Maturity Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies maturity guides for fresh nectarines in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table 1, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table 1 of &sect;916.356 for nectarines. This rule revises Table 1 of paragraph
(a)(1)(i) of &sect;916.356 for nectarines to add maturity guides for 18 nectarine varieties and to change the maturity
guide for two nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these maturity guide changes for these nectarine varieties based on a continuing review of their
individual maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the
``well matured'' level of maturity for such varieties.

Size Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies size requirements for fresh nectarines in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9). This rule
revises &sect;916.356 to establish variety-specific size requirements for seven nectarine varieties that were
produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages for the first time during the 1993 season.
Paragraph (a)(3) is revised to include the May Kist variety; and paragraph (a)(6) of &sect;916.356 is revised to include
the Arctic Rose, Del Rio Rey, Kay Diamond, Late Red Jim, Prima Diamond, and Red Glen varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises &sect;916.356 to remove five nectarine varieties from the variety-specific size requirements
specified in the section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced during the 1993
season. Paragraph (a)(4) of that section is revised to remove the Apache and Early May Grande nectarine varieties;
and paragraph (a)(6) is revised to remove the Nectarine #4, Tasty Free, and 9&hyph;86&hyph;04&hyph;87 nectarine
varieties. Nectarine varieties removed from the nectarine variety-specific list become subject to the non-listed
variety size requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9) of &sect;916.356. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also lowers the minimum size requirement for the Zee Grand variety by permitting as many as 88 nectarines
to be packed in a lug box rather than 84 nectarines, and as many as 83 nectarines when packed otherwise rather than 75
nectarines. This is accomplished by reassigning that variety to paragraph (a)(4) from paragraph (a)(5) in &sect;916.356.
The NAC recommended this change based on a more accurate evaluation of this variety's sizing and maturity characteristics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;916.356, paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (a)(9)(i) are revised to permit as many as 84 nectarines to be
packed in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) and (a)(9)(ii) are revised
to permit as many as 75 nectarines in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit late-season
nectarine varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the
higher ``well matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit,
because it will assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market
in the interest of growers, handlers, and consumers.

In addition, this rule changes the minimum size requirements for several varieties of nectarines packed in loose-filled
and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for nectarines specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3)(ii),
(a)(4)(ii), (a)(5)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), and (a)(8)(ii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes
made in column 2 of both Table 1 for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and Table 2 for late-season nectarine
varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these nectarine varieties, and consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. This rule
is designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh nectarines consistent with expected crop and market
conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;917.442, California Peach Container and Pack Regulation (7 CFR 917.442), fresh California peach shipments
are regulated by container and during the period April 15 through November 23 each year. Under &sect;917.459, California
Peach Grade and Size Regulation (7 CFR 917.459, as amended at 58 FR 32591, June 11, 1993, and 58 FR 43499, August 17, 1993),
fresh California peach shipments are also regulated by grade, maturity, and size during the period April 15 through
November 23 each year. These regulations are effective on a continuing basis subject to amendment, modification,
or suspension by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends paragraph (a) in &sect;917.442 and paragraph (a) in &sect;917.459 to change the regulatory periods
in each of these sections to April 1 through November 23 each year, so that all peach shipments made each season are covered
by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (b) of &sect;917.459 is revised to change the beginning
date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh peaches during the April
1&hyph;April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The PCC unanimously recommended this change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.442 currently specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;917.442 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound
sample for each tray pack size designation. This rule revises paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442 by modifying
Table 1 to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and adding a new Table
2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season peach varieties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PCC recommended these revised container marking requirements for peaches after a comprehensive review of the
appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled
containers for all peach varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different
varieties of fruit during the course of the season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises &sect;917.442 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises &sect;917.459 by redesignating
current paragraph (d) as (e) and adding a new paragraph (d) to that section. These revisions specify the procedure
to be used in determining whether peaches meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this
section when applying the 16-pound sample requirement. Under this procedure a sample consisting of one-half of the
number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample
weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half
a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum
size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must be used to determine if the fruit meets
the minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of peaches could be adequately
determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce
inspection time and inspection costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.459 specifies grade requirements for peaches in paragraph (a)(1), requiring peaches shipped fresh
to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade. This rule revises paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.459 to provide an
additional 25 percent tolerance for fruit damaged by open sutures, but not seriously damaged, in addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent general lot tolerance currently permitted under the U.S. No. 1 grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this change to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. Open sutures
are not considered to be a serious grade defect since they affect only the appearance of the fruit. The open suture condition
occurs infrequently in peaches and is most likely due to unusual weather and climatic conditions. However, this condition
can cause considerable economic loss to growers when it does occur, because it sometimes affects a large portion of
their crop.

Section 917.459 specifies maturity guides for fresh peaches in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including TABLE I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table 1 of &sect;917.459 for peaches. This rule revises Table 1 of paragraph (a)(1)(i)
of &sect;917.459 for peaches to add maturity guides for 19 peach varieties and to change the maturity guide for one
peach variety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these maturity guide changes for these peach varieties based on a continuing review of their individual
maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the ``well matured''
level of maturity for such varieties.

Section 917.459 specifies size requirements for fresh peaches in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6), and paragraphs
(b) and (c). This rule revises &sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (a)(6) as paragraph (a)(3) and current
paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) as paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively, so that the size regulations
are in sequential order. This rule also revises &sect;917.459 to establish variety-specific size requirements
for five peach varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages
for the first time during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) is revised to include the
Crimson Lady and Rich May peach varieties; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) is revised to include the Fancy Lady,
Snow Ball, and Sugar Lady peach varieties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also revises &sect;917.459 to remove four peach varieties from the variety-specific size requirements
specified in that section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced during the 1993
season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;917.459 is revised to remove the Flavor Red peach
variety; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) is revised to remove the July Lady, Red Cal, and Redglobe peach varieties.
Peach varieties removed from the variety-specific list become subject to the non-listed variety size requirements
specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;917.459. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also amends &sect;917.459 by revising paragraph (b) to change the ending date of the regulatory requirements
for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to June 30 from July 2, and paragraph (c) to change
the beginning date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph
to July 1 from July 3. These changes reflect the sizing characteristics of such peach varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(i) is revised to permit as many as 80 peaches to be packed
in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(iii) is revised to permit
as many as 73 peaches in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit certain late-season peach
varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well
matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will
assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest
of growers, handlers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule changes the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches packed in loose-filled
and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii),
and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table 1 for early-season
and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. This rule
is designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected crop and market conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the handling requirements
for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have
a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule establishes handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with expected
crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will meet acceptable
handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help the California nectarine
and peach industries provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed to establish and maintain orderly
marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) California nectarine and peach growers and handlers should be apprised of this rule as soon as possible,
since early shipments of these fruits are expected to begin about April first; (2) this rule relaxes grade requirements
for peaches and size requirements for several nectarine and peach varieties; (3) California nectarine and peach
handlers are aware of these revised requirements recommended by the committees at public meetings, and they will
need no additional time to comply with such requirements; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any
written comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.

(a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending October 31, no handler shall ship:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of nectarines unless such nectarines meet the requirements of U.S.
No. 1 grade: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That nectarines 2 inches in diameter or smaller, shall not have fairly light colored, fairly smooth scars which exceed
an aggregate area of a circle 3/8 inch in diameter, and nectarines larger than 2 inches in diameter shall not have fairly
light colored, fairly smooth scars which exceed an aggregate area of a circle 1/2 inch in diameter: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided further
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That an additional tolerance of 25 percent shall be permitted for fruit that is not well formed but not badly misshapen.
The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make final determinations on maturity through the use of color
guides or such other tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides listed in Table 1 in making maturity
determinations for the specified varieties when inspecting to the ``well matured'' level of maturity. For these
varieties, not less than 90 percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the variety, and an aggregate
area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety, except
that for the Fairlane, Tom Grand, and 61&hyph;61 varieties of nectarines, not less than an aggregate area of 80 percent
of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety. For varieties not listed, the Federal
or Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as it deems proper. A variance for any variety from the application
of the maturity guides specified in Table I may be granted during the season to reflect changes in crop, weather, or
other conditions that would make the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well matured.''

California Peach Grade and Size Regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending November 23, no handler shall ship: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of peaches unless such peaches meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1
grade: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That an additional 25 percent tolerance shall be permitted for fruit with open sutures which are damaged, but not
seriously damaged. The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make final determinations on maturity
through the use of color chips or other tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides listed in Table 1 in making maturity
determinations for the specified varieties when inspecting to the ``well matured'' level of maturity. For these
varieties, not less than 90 percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the variety, and an aggregate
area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety. For varieties
not listed, the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as it deems proper. A variance for
any variety from the application of the maturity guides specified in Table 1 may be granted during the season to reflect
changes in crop, weather, or other conditions that would make the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well
matured.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a grower or handler believes his/her fruit is meeting the appropriate maturity level but the fruit has not been
so graded by the inspector, he/she may appeal the inspection by calling the officer-in-charge of the local Federal-State
Inspection Service office to arrange for an on-site examination of the fruit.

least eight pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half
a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect
to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample shall be used to determine if the fruit
meets the minimum size requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 9, 1991, DOE published proposed regulations adding Part 830 to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations
in order to establish a body of rules for the safe management of DOE nuclear facilities (``December Notice,'' 56 FR
64316). The December Notice addressed nine specific areas related to nuclear safety: (1) Safety Analysis Reports,
(2) Unreviewed Safety Questions, (3) Quality Assurance Requirements, (4) Defect Identification, (5) Conduct of
Operations, (6) Technical Safety Requirements, (7) Training, (8) Maintenance, and (9) Operational Occurrences.

DOE received written comments from 29 groups on the December Notice and held a public hearing in Germantown, Maryland,
on February 25, 1992, at which five persons provided oral comments. After reviewing the written and oral comments,
DOE has decided to issue a final rule on the sections relating to the general provisions and the quality assurance requirements.
DOE will issue final rules on the remaining proposed sections of Part 830 as it completes its analysis of the individual
sections and the comments thereon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In order to implement the section on ``Quality Assurance Requirements,'' it is necessary to also issue the final rules
on the generally applicable provisions of part 830, &sect;&sect;830.1 through 830.7 and &sect;830.100, ``Scope
of subpart.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventy-eight comments were received on the ``Quality Assurance Requirements'' section.

II. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DOE has analyzed the comments on the December Notice as they relate to: (A) Part 830, general comments; (B) the general
provisions; and (C) the quality assurance requirements. Section II.A. summarizes the general comments and DOE's
responses; Section II.B. summarizes comments and the Department's responses to the general provisions in &sect;&sect;830.1
through 830.7; and Section II.C. summarizes comments and the Department's responses to the quality assurance requirements
in &sect;830.120. DOE will provide its responses to comments on other proposed sections in the December Notice when
it issues those sections as final rules.

A. Part 830, General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Several comments concerned the statutory authority for part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These concerns related to the authority for adopting the proposed rules and especially to the authority for imposing
civil penalties for violations of part 830. Some of the comments implied that the authority to adopt rules on the safe
management of DOE nuclear facilities was related to the authority to impose civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 161 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2201) provides DOE with broad authority to
carry out its responsibilities under the AEA, including the safe management of facilities authorized by the AEA.
This authority is the basis for all the rules concerning the safe management of nuclear facilities that DOE intends
to adopt in Part 830. The exercise of this authority is not dependent on whether a civil penalty can be imposed under
section 234A of the AEA (42 U.S.C. 2282a) if the rule is violated after its adoption. As discussed in the preamble to
the final rule on part 820 published on August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43680), DOE has determined that Part 830 contains the type
of requirements relating to nuclear safety that Section 234A contemplated would form a basis for civil penalties
if violated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several of the comments stated that the proposed rules would impose excessive costs on DOE contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE does not agree with these statements. For the most part, part 830 will codify requirements in existing DOE Orders
with which DOE contractors already are obligated contractually to comply. Accordingly, adoption of the proposed
rules should impose little or no additional costs on contractors. In order to confirm this premise, the December Notice
requested contractors to ``address the specific nature and scope of [any] additional costs to which contractors
would be subjected and explain why these concerns are not already addressed.'' None of the comments identified any
specific additional costs. Finally, DOE believes that the imposition of requirements through rules will add predictability
and stability to the DOE complex and, therefore, result in potentially lower operating costs to contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Several comments addressed proposed &sect;830.1 (Scope). In general, these comments questioned what facilities
would be subject to part 830. One comment suggested that a list of the facilities covered by part 830 should be agreed
upon between Management and Operating (M&amp;O) contractors and DOE to prevent confusion and unnecessary expenditures
of limited resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 830 applies to all ``nuclear facilities.'' DOE believes that the definition in &sect;830.3 is sufficient to
determine the applicability of part 830 to any particular facility. If there is uncertainty concerning a particular
facility, then an interpretation may be requested under part 820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several comments suggested alternative wording relative to the Nuclear Explosives and Weapons Safety Programs
exclusion in proposed &sect;830.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE does not find the suggested alternatives more clear. This exclusion, as worded, applies to activities related
to the prevention of accidental or unauthorized detonation of nuclear weapon devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Many of the comments addressed one or more of the definitions in proposed &sect;830.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE is responding to the substantive comments on those definitions that are being adopted in this final rule. DOE will
respond to the comments on other definitions when they are adopted in connection with the substantive sections to
which they apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment suggested that in order to make the definition of ``contractor'' more complete, the phrase ``laboratory
or program'' be added at the end of the definition after the term ``nuclear facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 830 is limited to activities at DOE nuclear facilities. Since ``nuclear facility'' is a defined term that does
not contain all DOE laboratories or programs, the addition of ``laboratory or program'' could create ambiguity concerning
the Scope of Part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment suggested that the definition of fissionable material was not broad enough and suggested that mixtures
of nuclides, such as enriched uranium, be included in the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE disagrees with this comment because the proposed definition includes mixtures of nuclides as long as the mixture
includes one or more of the nuclides which can sustain a neutron-induced fission chain reaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A number of comments were received stating that the definition of ``graded approach'' was too vague, and additional
guidance on its application is necessary. A comment was received that relative risk should be a mandatory consideration
for a graded approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of the term ``graded approach'' was developed to describe the process and factors used to determine
which actions would be appropriate for a particular facility. DOE believes that this process should be sufficiently
broad and flexible to take into account differences among various facilities. The intent of the graded approach is
to permit DOE contractors the flexibility to implement activities and processes, as appropriate, to comply with
the nuclear safety requirements for the individual facilities. The graded approach does not exempt a facility from
a nuclear safety requirement. In applying a graded approach, however, a determination may be made that certain actions
may not be appropriate for a particular facility. With respect to consideration of risk, this could be considered
under factor six, ``any other pertinent factors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Several comments stated that the definition of ``hazard'' was too general. It was felt that the definition should
be expanded to provide a quantitative statement to establish a threshold for when a situation posed a hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this comment. The term ``hazard'' includes all situations with any potential to cause harm to people,
facilities, or the environment. Quantitative considerations are taken into account in the graded approach when
the magnitude of a hazard is assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Several comments stated that the definition of ``hazard'' should be limited only to potential radiological releases
because the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, which continued and expanded indemnification for DOE contractors from
nuclear accidents and established the civil penalty program under 234A of the AEA, relates only to nuclear safety
issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this comment because nonradiological hazards may have nuclear safety implications. For example,
nonradiological hazardous materials may contribute to the release of or contamination by radioactivity, such as
initiating accidents, or worsening the consequences of accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A number of comments were received stating that the definition of the term ``nonreactor nuclear facility'' was
too vague and that some threshold relative to source term or some potential dose to the public or workers (a quantification)
should be included in the definition. Several individuals stated that this quantification must be provided in the
definition to prevent limited resources from being expended on non-nuclear or low hazard facilities. It was also
suggested that the definition of the term ``nonreactor nuclear facility'' be modified by deleting the reference
to graded approach in the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with this comment because the proposed definition was intended to cover all situations
(other than nuclear reactors) with the potential to cause radiological harm. The reference to the graded approach
was included to take into account the differences that exist between facilities and, thus, to avoid a rigid application
of nuclear safety requirements to divergent facilities and to encourage the taking of actions appropriate for particular
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Several comments recommended various operations (i.e., research and development laboratories, environmental
restoration, sealed sources, Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Program) be exempt from the provisions of these
rules. The potential risks associated with each of these operations was cited as being significantly different than
the risks posed by other nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has determined that all facilities with which nuclear materials are associated (except incidently) should be
covered by part 830. A facility's improper use of, work with, or handling of nuclear materials could result in damage
or injury caused by nuclear materials and, thus, are included in this DOE regulatory regime. The use of the graded approach
will permit consideration of differences among different facilities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Several organizations and individuals inquired if accelerators were nuclear facilities and, thus, are covered
by the DOE nuclear safety requirements in part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accelerators are specifically excluded from the definition of a nonreactor nuclear facility, and, as such, are excluded
from the provisions of part 830. Accelerators are not excluded from the radiation protection provisions of proposed
part 835 since that part covers nuclear activities rather than nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. One comment suggested that transportation and shipping be included in the definition of a nonreactor nuclear
facility because these operations could involve radioactive materials in sufficient quantities to have a potential
impact on the health and safety of the public and workers, or damage the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE agrees that transportation and shipping could involve significant quantities of radioactive materials, and
did not intend to cover these activities in the proposed sections of part 830. Therefore, we have specifically excluded
transportation of radioactive materials from the definition of nonreactor nuclear facility in the final rule. These
activities take place primarily off-site and are governed and regulated by either the U.S. Department of Transportation
or the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules. With regard to shipments on DOE sites, DOE intends to add provisions
covering these operations in subsequent amendments to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. One comment suggested that DOE be included in the definition of the term ``person.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed definition is the same as the definition in the AEA which specifically excludes DOE. DOE believes that
the rule need not be amended to include DOE because DOE imposes equivalent requirements on its employees through DOE
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. One comment suggested that the definition of ``process'' be modified to include administrative as well as physical
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``process'' is intended to include administrative and physical systems. To make this intent more
clear in the definition, DOE has replaced the term ``system'' with ``series.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment suggested that the words ``fails to meet'' be deleted from the definition of ``quality.'' Another
comment suggested that the phrase ``degree to which'' be replaced by ``condition achieved when.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that these two suggested changes result in a definition of ``quality'' that better reflects
the Department's intent. The modifications have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. A comment suggested that the definition of reactor was too broad, and that it be limited to include only the reactor,
containment, and critical support systems. It was suggested that such things as ancillary support facilities and
shops be excluded from the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE generally disagrees with this comment. The Department feels that all of the operations connected with a reactor
should be included in the definition because experience has shown that failures in ancillary support facilities
can propagate and cause failures to safety related systems. However, specific items can be excluded from the application
of nuclear safety requirements on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process set forth in 10 CFR part 820.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. A comment suggested that the ``reactor'' definition developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with
which everyone in the industry is familiar, should be used instead of the one in the proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this comment. The NRC definition for ``nuclear reactor'' contained in 10 CFR part 50 addresses
standardized power reactors. The population of DOE reactors is more diverse, including multiple designs and sizes
of reactors all with different purposes. For these reasons, the Department developed its own definition for ``reactor.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. One comment suggested that the definition for the term ``record'' be expanded to note that it is a document which
is completed according to applicable procedures governing its development, including any review and approval requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this suggestion because the proposed additions make the definition too limiting. For completeness,
DOE has added the term ``service'' to the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. It was suggested that the definition of service was incomplete without the addition of the words ``construction,
testing, environmental qualification, equipment qualification, and `or the like''' to the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees with the comment and has modified the definition accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. One individual expressed concern over the confusion that could potentially arise from the statement in 10 CFR
830.4 that, ``contractors responsible for design, construction, operations, or decommissioning of a facility
shall be responsible for compliance with this Part.'' In the potential situation where an M&amp;O contractor performs
construction activities at an existing facility being run by another M&amp;O contractor, the individual questioned
whether one or both of the contractors would be held accountable for compliance with nuclear safety requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 830.4(a) provides that all persons must act in accordance with part 830. Enforcement through the assessment
of civil penalties will apply only where there is a nexus between a person's activity and the violation. For example,
a person who designs a facility will not be responsible for a violation related to the operation of the facility unless
the design was somehow responsible for the violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. A comment stated that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to comply with &sect;830.4(b) which
requires facilities being decommissioned to meet the requirements of this Part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While facilities in the decommissioning phase will be required to comply with the provisions of this rule, the level
to which they are applied will be based on a graded approach taking into consideration the hazards associated with
a facility being decommissioned.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Several comments addressed provisions in certain of the proposed rules which require plans or programs to implement
those rules. These comments stated that more time should be given to prepare the plans and programs and that they not
provide the basis for the imposition of civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, plans that provide the schedules and actions necessary to implement the requirements of specific sections
must be submitted to DOE within 180 days of the effective date of the rule. DOE has decided this schedule is not unreasonably
short, especially since these plans are intended to identify the specific actions and programs necessary to fully
comply with a section which has a corresponding Order that is already effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes the expressed concerns relate more to the question of when a contractor must comply fully with a rule.
DOE expects a contractor to comply with a rule when it becomes effective. DOE understands that, in many circumstances,
a contractor may not be able to take all actions for full compliance immediately. The proposal was premised on the use,
where appropriate, of plans and programs to obtain full compliance with nuclear safety requirements. These plans
and programs were envisioned as setting forth the specific actions for implementing a requirement and the schedule
for taking those actions. DOE has decided to state this premise explicitly in the final rule by adding a definition
of ``implementation plan'' and by specifically requiring implementation plans in appropriate sections. Implementation
plans will set forth when and how a contractor will take those actions necessary to attain full compliance with the
provisions of a section or the provisions of a plan or program required by the section. Implementation plans also will
identify where a contractor cannot attain full compliance with a nuclear safety requirement and what relief a contractor
intends to seek. DOE also has modified Section 830.4 to make clear that, where required, implementation plans, along
with plans and programs, will be the basis for determining compliance with relevant nuclear safety requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes the use of plans, programs, and implementation plans will encourage DOE and its contractors to work together
to identify and take those actions appropriate for each facility. DOE expects its contractors will submit plans and
programs that represent a good faith effort to achieve full compliance with nuclear safety requirements as soon as
reasonably practicable. DOE intends to work with its contractors where there are differences about how and when to
achieve compliance. However, DOE will act to ensure that plans and programs are submitted and approved pursuant to
the schedules set forth in specific sections. To that end, if agreement cannot be negotiated with a contractor, DOE
will exercise its authority to modify submitted plans that do not include those actions and schedules appropriate
for achieving full compliance in a reasonable manner. The nature of plans is discussed more thoroughly in the preamble
to the final rule on Part 820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. There were many comments related to the enforcement (Section 830.5) of part 830 using the provisions of 10 CFR part
820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The responses to these comments were included in the publication package of 10 CFR part 820. The general provisions
in this subpart are unaffected by those comments relating to the specifics of enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. One commenter suggested that 10 CFR 830.7(a) be revised to read as follows: ``A graded approach shall be utilized
to comply with the requirements.'' The individual felt that the intent of the rule is to apply a graded approach across
the board to all nuclear safety requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has not adopted this comment with respect to reactors generally because there are some areas in reactor
safety where a graded approach is not justified; therefore, grading applies only to those subparts where it is specifically
referenced. The definition of nonreactor nuclear facility indicates that grading always applies to such a facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. A number of comments were received which stated that the burden of justifying the use of the graded approach to meet
each of the nuclear safety requirements will require considerable resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of paragraph 830.7(b) is that contractors document the basis for the actions selected pursuant to the graded
approach, where it is permitted. Paragraph 830.7(b) has been modified to state this intent. Implementation of requirements
using a documented graded approach will require less resources than an approach which requires full compliance with
all requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the scope of QAP submittals, DOE agrees that they should be limited to a ``description'' of the QAP. It is
not the Department's intent that submittals of the QAP include contractor policy manuals, organization charts and
charters, and implementing procedures. The definition of ``Quality Assurance Program'' in &sect;830.3 makes this
clear when it states that the ``QAP means the overall program for a DOE nuclear facility which assigns responsibilities
and authorities, defines policies and requirements, and provides for the performance and assessment of work.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding multiple QAPs for one facility, the Department believes that there may be cases where some facilities will
require separate QAPs to address their widely different work. However, the Department also believes that it is possible
in many instances to develop and implement a site-wide QAP where multiple facilities exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. There were several comments regarding the approval of QAPs. The first dealt with the concept of automatically approving
QAPs after 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This concept is not new. The NRC has successfully implemented a similar program for the past 10 years. The intent of
the 90-day limitation (unless approved or rejected by DOE prior to that time) is to avoid situations where contractors
are left without a decision regarding their QAPs' acceptability because DOE exigencies preclude timely review.
It is the Department's expectation that DOE will review QAPs within the allotted time. If for some reason the review
cannot be accomplished in the allotted time, the program will be approved and in effect, subject to DOE's right to modify
the program at a later time. Implementation plans will be approved in the same manner as QAPs. (See response to Question
22 in previous section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Another comment suggested that annual approval of changes to QAPs was too infrequent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experience at the NRC has shown that changes to QAPs do not manifest themselves at the working level so quickly as to
require formal submittal and review more often than once per year. If an interim change to a QAP violates nuclear safety
requirements, the contractor is subject to enforcement action if the violation has safety significance since a QAP
must be consistent with the criteria set forth in &sect;830.120. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Another comment dealt with the level of approval. The comment suggested that the rule specify the precise level
of DOE approval for QAPs. Specifically, it was suggested that the Program Secretarial Officer be designated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not agree that the titles of those persons or organizations responsible for approving QAPs should
appear in the rule because of the potential administrative burden it would cause. Specific titles, such as ``Program
Secretarial Officer,'' are subject to routine changes, and these changes would necessitate routine revisions to
the rule if the titles were included in the text of the rule. The specific level of approval for QAPs should be specified
in the operating procedures of the individual program offices tasked with that responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Lastly, one comment suggested that the rule be revised to state that the contractor's approved QAP be used as the
basis against which assessments would be conducted and the contractor held accountable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, &sect;830.4(c) makes clear that the QAP and the implementation plan for &sect;830.120
will be used to determine compliance with &sect;830.120.

6. Two comments noted the apparent overlap of &sect;830.120 and DOE Order 5700.6C, ``Quality Assurance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 830.120 is intended to supersede the existing requirements in DOE 5700.6C, ``Quality Assurance,'' for nuclear
facilities. If any quality assurance program is implemented on a site-wide basis, non-nuclear facilities at that
site will continue to be covered by the DOE Order while nuclear facilities will be covered by &sect;830.120. DOE 5700.6C
is being revised to reflect these changes in scope.

Grading

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Four comments addressed the need to consider nuclear safety significance in determining the rigor with which the
requirements of the rule are applied. Several other comments expressed concern that applying the rule, without distinguishing
between the relative importance of the work to which it applies, was impracticable. In addition, there were two comments
regarding the rule's use of the term risk. Both comments proposed that the term ``hazard'' was more appropriate and
better reflected the concept of grading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that the use of the term ``risk'' was inappropriate, but rather than using the term ``hazard,''
a new sentence regarding grading was added to paragraph (b)(1).

Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

8. There were three comments relating to standards. One comment expressed the need for a uniform set of quality assurance
guidelines and standards for use by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that there is a need for a uniform set of standards for all activities, including quality assurance.
The Department strongly supports the development of standards and guidelines. Accordingly, DOE will develop and
issue quality assurance standards and guidance to support promulgation of QAPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Two comments suggested that the rule's ``generalized'' reference to the use of standards was not sufficient to
ensure acceptable work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule in paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;830.120 provides for the use of standards to develop and implement QAPs. Because
there are numerous quality assurance standards and they are continuously changing, it would be unnecessarily limiting
to mandate in the rule a particular standard or set of standards that must be used by contractors. Any number of standards
can be proposed, justified, and approved.

10. There was one comment addressing a perceived reduction in quality assurance requirements. The comment stated
that the rule ``has reduced the level of requirements for the application of material control, process control and
calibration control from the level of requirements specified in DOE Order 5700.6C.'' The comment further stated
that ``the rule fails to adequately address the following 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, requirements: Calibration of
measuring and test equipment, special process controls, control of design input and design analysis, procurement
planning and selection of suppliers, qualification of inspection and test personnel, inspection planning and in-process
inspection, test records and procedure content, identification and control of inspection or test status, identification,
retrieval and retention of records.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the Department disagrees that the rule has ``reduced the level of requirements for the application of material
control, process control, and calibration control from the level of requirement[s] specified in DOE Order 5700.6C.''
The basic requirements of DOE 5700.6C and &sect;830.120 are identical; therefore, there can be no reduction in requirements.
Secondly, regarding the rule's purported failure to address certain requirements from 10 CFR part 50, appendix B,
they are addressed in the following sections of &sect;830.120: (1) Calibration of measuring and test equipment_paragraph
(c)(2)(iv), (2) special process controls_paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (iv), (3) control of design input and design
analysis_paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (4) procurement planning and selection of suppliers_paragraph (c)(2)(iii),

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. There were three comments regarding the inclusion of planning, schedule, and cost-control as part of the quality
assurance program. All three organizations asserted that planning, scheduling, and cost-control were not directly
pertinent to nuclear safety and, therefore, should not be addressed in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inclusion of these considerations is a departure from the traditional approach to quality assurance. DOE disagrees
that they are not directly pertinent to nuclear safety. Because the quality assurance program described by the rule
is a management system involving all organizational components, including management and the line organization,
these considerations must be taken into account. Contemporary practice has shown that quality, costs, schedule,
resources, and planning are inseparable and integral parts of the quality system and cannot be separated as they have
been in the past.

12. There were two comments regarding perceived conflicts between Parts 830.120, ``Quality Assurance Requirements,''
830.330, ``Training and Certification,'' and 830.110, ``Safety Analysis Reports'' (SARs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees that there is a conflict between the requirements of &sect;&sect;830.120, 830.330, and 830.110. Section
830.120, ``Quality Assurance Requirements,'' provides generic training and qualification requirements that
pertain to all contractor personnel performing work at a DOE facility. Section 830.330, ``Training and Certification,''
elaborates on these generic requirements by providing specific training and certification requirements for specific
categories of employees, such as reactor operators, nuclear facility operators, senior reactor operators, and
nuclear facility supervisors. Section 830.110, ``Safety Analysis Reports,'' sets forth the topic areas, including
training, to be addressed in each facility's SAR. The details of training to be included in the SAR will be based on the
generic requirements of Section 830.120 and the specific requirements of Section 830.330.

 The Department agrees and has modified paragraph (c)(1)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Two comments suggested that the term ``significant'' be introduced into Criterion 3 when referring to the types
of problems that require corrective action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is the Department's position that the causes of all problems (not just those considered significant or generic)
should be identified and corrected. In doing this, the rigor with which a problem is investigated and corrective action
taken should be commensurate with the importance of the problem and the work affected (graded approach).

15. There was one comment regarding paragraph (c)(1)(iv). The comment stated that the rule ``makes no provision for
the identification, retrieval, or retention of records as required by 10 CFR part 50, appendix B.'' The comment maintained
that the rule would ``appear to be a step backward in the protection of records, yet the draft safety guide invokes DOE
1324.2A and mandates National Archives and Records Administration rules as applicable to nuclear facilities. This
contradicts the purpose of the rulemaking process which would replace Orders with rules.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As written, the rule requires that records be specified, prepared, reviewed, approved, and maintained. While this
terminology is different than that used in 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, it does encompass the concepts of record ``identification,
retrieval, [and] retention'' as stated in appendix B. Secondly, safety guides do not invoke or mandate requirements.
DOE safety guides provide DOE contractors with acceptable methods for implementing specific parts of the Department's
rules. Safety guides are not substitutes for rules, and while they must be considered by contractors, methods and
solutions different from those set out in the guides are acceptable if the requirements of the rule are met.

 Criterion 5 addresses ``Work Processes.'' The Department considers operations to be a work process. Criterion 5
goes further to require that work (like the operations process) be performed using approved instructions, procedures,
or other appropriate means. Operations procedures, the term used in &sect;830.310, describe how work is to be accomplished
during the operation of DOE facilities. Operations procedures are one type_a subset_of procedures required by Criterion
5 (maintenance procedures are another).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees. The rule establishes basic quality assurance requirements applicable to the many and
diverse types of work performed by and for the Department. Criterion 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(i)) requires that ``Items
be identified and controlled to ensure their proper use.'' The definition of ``item'' provided by the rule encompasses
environmental samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment also stated that the rule did not provide requirements for item identification and traceability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the previous paragraph, Criterion 5 requires that ``Items be identified and controlled to ensure their
proper use.'' ``Traceability'' is one way to ensure that items are ``controlled'' as required by the rule. For that
reason, the rule does not specifically address traceability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Additionally, a comment stated that Criterion 5 of the rule did not address ``special processes'' as does the NRC's
10 CFR part 50, appendix B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In developing the rule, the Department found that work, such as welding and non-destructive testing, have traditionally
been referred to by the commercial nuclear industry as ``special processes'' because of the way their acceptability
was determined (in-process). The rule, because it is not inspection-driven like 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, does not
distinguish between different types of work based on whether or not it can be ``readily inspected.'' How the acceptability
of a work process is determined does not make a work process ``special.'' Rather, the rule, in Criterion 5 (paragraph
(c)(2)(i)) focuses on the line organization's performance of work. Inspection and acceptance testing of all types
of work, both ``regular'' and ``special,'' is addressed by the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(iv), ``Inspection and Acceptance
Testing.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of Section 830.120 are not limited to the design of engineered structures. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)
of the rule requires that ``work (which includes those suggested in the comment) be performed to established technical
standards and administrative controls'' and that ``work shall be performed under controlled conditions using approved
instructions, procedures, or other appropriate means.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees. As written, paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of the section requires that all procured items (commercial
grade items are one type of procured item) meet established requirements and perform as expected. Nowhere in the section
does it require that procurement be limited only to suppliers ``that have quality assurance programs.'' To the contrary,
the section requires that procured items ``meet established requirements and perform as expected.'' The way in which
requirements are met should be specified in the contractor's QAP taking into account the relative importance of the
item or service being procured (graded approach).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24. There were three comments relating to different aspects of Criterion 8. The first comment concerned the rule's
perceived failure to provide for in-process inspection or test, particularly with regard to site characteristic
testing for remediation work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As written, the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) requires that inspection and acceptance testing of specified items
and processes (this includes testing of site characteristics) be conducted using established acceptance and performance
criteria. In-process inspection and testing is not specifically called out in the rule because it is one of many techniques
for conducting inspections and tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. The second comment dealt with test status. The comment stated that the rule provides no definition of requirements
for the identification and control of inspection or test status as required by 10 CFR part 50, appendix B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees. As written, paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of the section establishes a basic requirement that
inspections and acceptance testing be performed. In practice, one aspect of properly performing the work of inspecting
and testing is to ensure that the status of the item be known, such that the inspection or test is properly completed
and the item is not relied on to perform this intended function. It is inappropriate to include this level of detail
in a rule whose intention it is to establish basic quality assurance requirements applicable to all DOE facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The third comment dealt with the calibration of instruments and the perception that the rule only addresses the
calibration of process monitoring instrumentation and data collection equipment. The comment maintained that
the rule does not address requirements for calibration interval, accuracy, and stability in process monitoring
instrumentation or equipment used to collect environmental data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In actuality, the rule, as written, addresses both the calibration and maintenance of equipment used for inspection
and acceptance testing (paragraph (c)(2)(iv)) and the calibration and maintenance of equipment used for monitoring
and data collection (paragraph (c)(2)(i)). It is the Department's position that the phrase ``calibration and maintenance''
encompasses the ``requirements for calibration interval, accuracy, [and] stability.''

Management Assessment (Criterion 9) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. There were three comments regarding the requirements of Criterion 9. One comment noted that the requirement to
conduct periodic assessments of integrated performance at ``all'' levels of management is too restrictive and unnecessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees and has revised paragraph (c)(3)(i) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. A second comment requested clarification of Criterion 9 regarding who in management was required to perform the
assessments. The comment asserted that individual managers have the responsibility and authority ``to assess the
QA program'' within their cognizant areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE agrees. Criterion 9 recognizes this and requires that these individual inputs be gathered and combined by upper
level managers into an overall assessment of the integrated management system. This management assessment should
seek common weaknesses and areas needing improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. The third comment states that &sect;830.120 ``contradicts the requirements of &sect;830.310 which requires
that the conduct of operations program and its effectiveness on facility operations will be assessed through management
observation and audit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department sees no conflict between the requirements of &sect;830.120 paragraph (c)(3)(i) and &sect;830.310
paragraph (g) because the two are unrelated. Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of &sect;830.120 addresses ``management assessment,''
while paragraph (g) of &sect;830.310 addresses the ``independent assessment'' component of &sect;830.120 which
is in paragraph (c)(3)(ii). To make this distinction more clear, paragraph (g) of &sect;830.310 will be revised to
reflect the language from &sect;830.120.

NQA&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30. One individual observed that DOE had previously ``imposed'' ASME/NQA&hyph;1 for all of its sites and that the
Department would be better served by continuing its use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Neither DOE 5700.6C nor its predecessor, 5700.6B, ``imposed'' NQA&hyph;1. DOE 5700.6B referred to NQA&hyph;1 as
a ``preferred'' standard and 5700.6C referenced it for general information only. In practice, NQA&hyph;1 is a national
consensus standard. It interprets the requirements of the NRC's 10 CFR part 50, appendix B and provides guidance for
developing and implementing quality assurance programs at specific types of nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not prohibit the use of NQA&hyph;1 at the Department's nuclear facilities. Just as the NRC has endorsed
NQA&hyph;1 as an acceptable way (there are others) for their licensees to implement the requirements of appendix
B, DOE contractors may use NQA&hyph;1 as a way to implement the rule. In addition, DOE (like the NRC) will permit contractors
(NRC licensees) to use other industry standards as long as their applications result in acceptable product and service
quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. One comment stated that the rule did not provide ``even a minimum level of requirements for software quality as
required by existing DOE Orders and NRC NUREG&hyph;1200.'' The comment asserted that the absence of software quality
assurance requirements was a significant shortcoming in the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule in paragraph (a)(1)(i) requires that a contractor conduct its work in accordance with the criteria of paragraph
(c). Because DOE considers software to be a type of work, it follows that all the quality assurance requirements of
the rule apply to software.

Suppliers/Subcontractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
32. Two organizations commented that the intent of paragraph (a)(2) was not clear and that methods to implement its
requirements were not provided by the rule. Additionally, a general comment was submitted exploring whether or not
subcontractors and suppliers performing services for DOE are required under the provision of the rule to develop
and submit a QAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2), which required that subcontractors and suppliers comply with the ``standards of quality set forth
in the QAP,'' has been deleted. After review, the Department determined that paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of the rule adequately
addresses this issue by establishing basic requirements for procurement. It states that items and services (this
includes items and services procured from subcontractors and suppliers) must meet established requirements and
perform as expected. Subcontractors and suppliers are not required to submit to DOE their QAPs for review and approval;
rather, it is left to the contractor to determine the methods for ensuring that procured items and services meet requirements
and perform as expected. Any person, including indemnified contractors and their subcontractors and suppliers,
subject to requirements in a QAP, may be subject to enforcement actions under part 820 if those requirements are violated.

III. Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the public comments, DOE has decided to adopt 10 CFR 830.1 through 830.7, 830.100, and 830.120 with
the modifications described in the previous section and several editorial changes. A section by section description
of the final rule follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.1 mandates that the scope of part 830 is all DOE nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.2 stipulates that the activities excluded from the provisions of part 830 include activities regulated
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or NRC Agreement States, activities conducted by the Naval Nuclear Propulsion
Program, and activities conducted under the Nuclear Explosives and Weapons Safety Program. The final rule has been
modified to make clear that the exclusion applies to activities of the United States Enrichment Corporation to the
extent that those activities have been certified by the NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.3 provides the definitions of terms related to &sect;&sect;830.1 through 830.7, 830.100, and 830.120.
New definitions for ``DOE nuclear facilities'' and ``implementation plans'' have been included to remove any ambiguity
concerning the meaning of these terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.4, General Rule, indicates that no person shall prevent compliance with the provisions of the rule. In
addition, it requires that contractors responsible for managing and operating the Department's nuclear facilities
shall be responsible for implementing and complying with the provisions of part 830. Paragraph (c) has been included
to make clear that contractors must comply with any plans, programs, or implementation plans required by a section
and that, where required, they are intended to be the means by which compliance is determined. In particular, implementation
plans will be used to set forth the manner in which full compliance with specific requirements will be attained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.5 provides that part 830 shall be enforced according to the provisions of 10 CFR part 820, published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43680). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.6 requires that records be maintained such that compliance with the provisions of part 830 can be substantiated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.7 mandates the use of a graded approach when so indicated in a subpart. It also requires the documentation
of the reasons for the selection of specific actions to be taken pursuant to the graded approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.100, Scope of subpart, provides a statement of general applicability for Subpart A of part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Quality Assurance Requirements'' section, 830.120, mandates the development and implementation of a formalized
quality assurance program. To ensure full compliance, DOE will review and approve contractor-proposed quality
assurance programs and will evaluate contractor performance against the approved program including any modifications
made or directed by DOE. Because of the clarification concerning implementation plans, DOE has decided to delete
the proposed distinction between new and existing facilities. However, DOE does not expect to authorize the operation
of any new facility unless a quality assurance program is approved and full compliance with &sect;830.120 is assured.

A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's regulatory action has been determined to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866,
``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was subject to review
under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). There were no substantive changes
between the draft submitted to OIRA and today's action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft of today's action and any other documents submitted to OIRA for review have been made a part of the rulemaking
record and are available for public review in the Department's Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1000 Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585 between the hours of 9 and 4, Monday through Friday, telephone (202) 586&hyph;6020.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. DOE certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities; therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No new information collection or record keeping requirements are imposed by this final rule. Information collection
provisions of this rule were previously approved under OMB Control No. 1910&hyph;0300. Accordingly, no Office of
Management and Budget clearance is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990 (44 U.S.C. 3501

D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant
impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1959 [42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 (1976)], or the Council of Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and DOE guidelines (10
CFR part 1021), and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment
pursuant to NEPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987) requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National
Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National Government
and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government, the Executive
Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing
a policy action. This final rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional
functions of States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. The DOE certifies that today's rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, that requires modification of the fuel crossfeed low level dump system shutoff. This
amendment is prompted by an FAA determination that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent
loss of the number 2 electrical power source, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during
or shortly after a fuel dumping operation. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the fuel
dump system shutoff due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of the number 2 electrical
power source.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD), that is
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64708). That action proposed to require modification of the fuel crossfeed low level dump
system shutoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 15 months to modify the fuel crossfeed low level dump system
shutoff be extended to 24 months to coincide with regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The commenter states that a compliance
time of 24 months would allow operators some latitude to schedule the accomplishment of this modification. The FAA
concurs with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time for the modification requirement so that the modification
can be performed at a maintenance base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained
maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Extending the compliance time by 9 additional months will
not adversely affect safety since the interim procedures [via a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)] required
by AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8392 (57 FR 47570, October 19, 1992) will detect electrical malfunctions
that may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. Therefore, paragraph (a) of the final rule
has been revised to specify a compliance time of 24 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 98 McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 43 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will
take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is
$55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $5,688 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $258,774, or $6,018 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

with ones made of Inconel 718 material, and eventual replacement of all H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain
critical locations with Inconel 718 material bolts. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracked and fractured
H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations of the airframe structure. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent the failure of attachment bolts in critical locations, which could lead to severe
airframe damage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65567). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracked or fractured H&hyph;11
steel bolts, replacement of discrepant bolts with ones made of Inconel 718 material, and eventual replacement of
all H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations with bolts made of Inconel 718 material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that the applicability of the proposal be revised to exclude Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes.
These commenters state, and the manufacturer has confirmed, that these airplanes were delivered without H&hyph;11
steel bolts installed. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service
Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994, which excludes Model 747&hyph;400 series
airplanes from the effectivity listing. Since these airplanes were not delivered with H&hyph;11 bolts, they are
not subject to the addressed unsafe condition. The FAA has revised the final rule to exclude Model 747&hyph;400 series
airplanes from the applicability, and to reference this latest revision of the service bulletin as an additional
source of appropriate service information. Additionally, the FAA has revised the economic impact information,
below, to reflect the exclusion of Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 60 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 7 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take an average of 15 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed inspection actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection action of this AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $5,775, or $825 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take an average of 240 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed bolt replacement action, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required parts would cost approximately $11,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total cost impact of the proposed replacement action of this AD on U.S. operators is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $169,400, or $24,200 per airplane. (This estimate assumes that H&hyph;11 steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bolts are found at all affected locations.) Accomplishment of this replacement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates the repetitive inspection requirement; therefore the accomplishment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement will result in a reduction in costs to affected operators of $275 per airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per inspection cycle that will no longer be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54353), EPA issued a notice which announced that Micro Flo Co., P.O. Box 5948, Lakeland, FL
33807, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4196) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180, under section 408 of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, by establishing a regulation to exempt from the requirement
of a tolerance residues of the following biochemical pesticide plant floral volatile attractant compounds: cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamyl alcohol, 4-methoxy cinnamaldehyde, 3-phenyl propanol, 4-methoxy phenethyl alcohol, indole, and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene
on the following raw agricultural commodities: the following field crops_alfalfa, clover, cotton, dandelion,
peanuts (including hay), rice, sorghum (milo), soybeans, sunflower, sweet potatoes, and wheat; the following vegetable
crops_ asparagus, beans (including forage hay), beets, carrots, celery, cole crops (cabbage, broccoli, brussels
sprouts, cauliflower), collards (kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, kohlrabi), corn, fresh (field, sweet, pop,
seed), corn fodder and forage, chinese cabbage, cowpeas, cucurbitis (cucumbers, squash, pumpkin), egg plant, endive
(escarole), horseradish (radish, rutabagas, turnip roots), leafy greens (spinach, swiss chard), lettuce (head
leaf), okra, parsley, parsnip, peas, peas with pods, peppers, potatoes, sugar beets, tomatoes; the following tree
fruit, berry and nut crops_almonds, apples, apricots, berries (blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry, loganberry,
raspberry), blueberry, cherry, citrus (grapefruit, kumquat, lemon, lime, orange, tangelo, and tangerine) cranberry,
grapes, melons, (watermelon, honeydew, crenshaw, cantaloupe, casaba, persian), nectarines, pears, pecans, peaches,

, a pesticidal bait. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has classified the seven floral attractants as biochemical pesticides based on their nontoxic mode of
action and the natural occurrence of the components. The Agency notes that with the exception of 4-methoxy phenethyl
alcohol and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, the various components are used in the flavor and fragrance industry and are
considered generally recognized as safe by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No residue chemistry data were required. The Agency has taken into consideration the use pattern of the end-use product,
its formulation, and the low application rate of the subject plant floral volatile attractants from the end-use product.
The application rate of the subject attractants would be less than or equal to 20 grams of each per acre per application,
given a maximum label rate of 5 applications of 10 pounds of Corn Rootworm Bait

Based on the information cited above and the conditions of use, the Agency has determined that the establishment of
an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance in 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance
is established as set forth below.

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20.
The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for
the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27.
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested. 40 CFR 178.32.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because certain aspects of the procedures adopted by the FCC for filing and acceptance of 220&hyph;222 MHz license
applications were appealed, non-nationwide licensees were granted an extension of 120 days from the final disposition
of the appeal to construct their systems and place them in operation. The relevant appeal was settled. Upon motion
by affected licensees, the Private Radio Bureau has adopted this Order granting an extension of time through December
2, 1994, for non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensees to construct their systems and place them in operation. This
action provides affected licensees with necessary time to account for the unanticipated prompt appellate finality
that followed a previous period of uncertainty with respect to equipment purchasing, financing, system construction
and management contracts.

By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On July 30, 1992, certain aspects of the Commission's procedures for filing and acceptance of 220&hyph;222 MHz
license applications were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, we conditioned all grants of 220&hyph;222 MHz licenses upon the outcome of this appeal. We granted each
non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensee, regardless of its initial authorization date, an automatic extended
period of 120 days from the date of the appeal's final disposition by the courts, to construct and place its licensed
facilities in operation.

3. On February 15, 1994, the law firm of Keller and Heckman, on behalf of various 220 MHz licensees, requested that the
Commission extend the time to construct non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz facilities from 120 days after resolution
of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 240 days after its resolution. Keller and Heckman based this request on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The unanticipated prompt appellate finality achieved by settlement of this matter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The probable inability of 220&hyph;222 MHz equipment vendors to accommodate, within a 120-day timeframe, the
thousands of equipment orders that are likely to be placed with the advent of a settlement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The likelihood that such an extension will result in the provision of 220&hyph;222 MHz local service to the public
more quickly than through the automatic cancellation of existing licenses followed by the selection of new licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Keller and Heckman indicated that most 220&hyph;222 MHz non-nationwide licensees ``have been highly reluctant
to commit to decisions on equipment purchasing, financing, system construction and management contracts while
the air of uncertainty as to license retention created by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
case''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 continues to prevail. Keller and Heckman stated that the requested extension would allow licensees the requisite
time needed to address these matters.

authorized on or before the release date of this Order must construct their facilities and place them in operation

 This rule amends Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems, to create an exception to the requirement that a restraint
must not change its adjustment position during dynamic compliance testing. A change in adjustment positions of a
rear-facing restraint, i.e., infant restraint, is permitted subject to a requirement intended to ensure that the
design allowing such movement will not injure the infant.

The amendment will permit the production of restraints specially designed for infants with apnea or other breathing
problems. To facilitate breathing by these infants, these restraints allow infants to ride in the reclined position
under normal driving conditions. However, when the restraint is subjected to the forces of a frontal vehicle crash,
a portion of the restraint adjusts so that the infants move into an upright, rear-facing position. In this position,
the crash forces are spread over the full torso and the back of the infant's head is supported, thus reducing the chance
of injury.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the requirement in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,''
that a child restraint with adjustable (reclinable) positions must not change its adjustment position during dynamic
testing (S5.1.1(b)). The purpose of the requirement is to prevent a child's fingers or limbs from being caught between
the shifting parts of the restraint. Today's rule permits a change in adjustment positions of a rear-facing restraint
system, i.e., infant restraint, provided that the restraint meets a requirement intended to ensure such movement
will not injure the child. The amendments made by this document were proposed in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
published on May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30134). NHTSA commenced this rulemaking action in response to a petition for rulemaking
from Century Products Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions adopted in today's document are substantially similar to those NHTSA proposed in the May 1993 NPRM.
This rule permits an infant restraint to have a means for repositioning the seating surface of the restraint that allows
an infant to move from a reclined position to an upright position during a frontal crash. To protect the infant during
that change in adjustment position, the rule regulates exposed openings in the restraint structure. No opening that
is exposed and is larger than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) before the testing is permitted to become smaller during the movement
of the seating surface relative to the restraint system as a whole. This rule also requires that the printed instructions
accompanying each rear-facing child restraint system that has a means for repositioning the seating surface of the
system include a warning against impeding the ability of the restraint to change adjustment position.

Infant Restraints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An infant restraint is a child restraint system, except a car bed, that positions a child so that the child faces toward
the rear of the motor vehicle. Most infant restraints are conventional rear-facing seats which are designed for infants
only, and are intended to be installed so that the infant faces the rear of the vehicle. There are other child restraints
that are convertible into two different modes. In one mode, these restraints are rear-facing so that they can be used
by infants. In the other mode, these restraints are forward-facing so that they can be used by toddlers. (When the term
``infant restraint'' is used below, it refers both to infant seats which are exclusively for infants and to the infant
mode of convertible child restraints.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Infant restraints are designed to meet infants' particular physical needs. An infant cannot be seated in a completely
upright position since its neck muscles are not strong enough to enable the infant to hold its head upright. An infant
restraint must be designed, therefore, so that it supports the infant's spine and head in a partially inclined position.
At the same time, an infant must be positioned sufficiently upright and rear-facing so that in a crash, the forces are
spread evenly across the infant's back and shoulders, the strongest part of an infant's body. Further, an infant restraint
positions the back of the child's head against the restraint's seating surface in a crash. This helps to prevent severe
neck injuries.

Century's Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Century submitted its petition because it wishes to produce an infant restraint that, under normal driving conditions,
would allow the infant to lie on its back in a more reclined position than is possible in current infant restraints,
with the infant's head nearest the front of the vehicle and its feet nearest the rear of the vehicle. To provide proper
protection in a frontal crash, a portion of the infant seat, including the surface on which the infant is resting, would
change position by rotating upwards and toward the front of the vehicle so that the child would be rear-facing and almost
upright. As a result, the crash forces would be applied to and spread across the infant's neck and shoulders. In the
almost upright mode, the restraint would provide occupant protection similar to that provided by infant seats lacking
the capability of dynamic readjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner described three ways in which safety could be improved if infant seats were allowed to change adjustment
positions in a crash. First, the petitioner believes designing an infant seat so that it changes adjustment positions
during a frontal crash could reduce the crash forces imposed on the child. The movement due to the change in position
could help dissipate the stored kinetic energy during the initial stage of a frontal crash (i.e., when the momentum
of the child and rear-facing seat are causing them to attempt to move toward the front of the vehicle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second improvement in safety relates to what Century stated was the primary advantage of the new seat. The petitioner
believed the seat would enable a child to travel in a more reclined position than is possible with current infant seats.
The petitioner said that this would benefit premature, apnea-prone infants, and infants with other breathing problems.
Included in Century's petition was the petitioner's public service message on ``positional apnea.'' It explains
the problems that infants with positional apnea have when riding in current infant restraints:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Positional Apnea is a breathing difficulty that could occur when very small infants are positioned in an upright angle
in infant products such as car seats, car beds, strollers, carriers, swings, etc. Because of their tiny bodies and
weak necks, small infants are in danger of Positional Apnea. If the angle of the child in the infant product is too steep,
the infant's head may fall forward far enough to choke off his/her air supply. Depending on the positioning of the child
in an infant product, the risk to the child may be increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To explain its reasons for believing a change to S5.1.1(b) would help children with apnea, Century submitted articles
and statements from members of the medical community on positional apnea. These materials are fully discussed in
the NPRM. They include a July 1990 policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics on the safe transportation
of premature infants, which states that some infants, particularly premature, low-weight infants, may be subject
to oxygen desaturation when placed in an upright position in infant restraints. Century argued that the articles
indicate a need for new infant restraint designs that are specially designed, such as the infant seat the petitioner
wishes to produce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third advantage of the seat relates to improved positioning of all infants in infant restraints. Infant restraints
are tested by NHTSA for compliance with FMVSS No. 213 on a ``standard seat assembly,'' which is an essentially horizontal
vehicle seat cushion. The ``standard seat assembly'' is specified in S7.3 of the standard. If the vehicle seat cushions
actually being installed in vehicles are not horizontal, but slant downward to the rear, as they do in some newer model
cars, an infant restraint placed on that vehicle seat cushion would be tilted rearward. Thus, an infant riding in the
infant restraint would likely sit more upright than if the infant restraint were placed on a horizontal vehicle seat
cushion. A restraint's back support surface that is too upright might not be able to provide adequate support to the
infant's head and neck. Century said that its new infant restraint would compensate for the effect that a slanting
vehicle seat cushion may have on infant restraints.

The NPRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed amending S5.1.1 to permit infant restraints to have a means for enabling the seating surface of the
system to adjust during testing so that the restraint's occupant would move from a reclined position to an upright
position. Under the NPRM, the movement of the seating surface during testing, relative to the restraint as a whole,
had to be unidirectional rotation or translation. The NPRM also proposed that no opening in the restraint structure
that is exposed and is larger than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) before the testing shall become smaller during the testing as a
result of the movement of the seating surface relative to the restraint as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were expressly sought on the following issues. First, whether movement of the seating surface during dynamic
testing should be permitted for child restraints other than infant restraints. Second, whether movement during
dynamic testing must occur only unidirectionally in a rotational or translational motion. Third, whether there
should be greater leeway in how exposed openings may close. In addition, the NPRM sought comments on whether a change
in infant restraint adjustment position during a sudden deceleration should be permitted as a potential way of protecting
children from injury that might otherwise result from an air bag impacting the child restraint during a crash.

Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA received eight comments on the NPRM. Commenters were Century, Ford, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Advocates
for Highway and Auto Safety, Congressman Thomas C. Sawyer of Ohio, and three private individuals interested in child
seat safety (Messrs. Jerome Koziatek, Donald Friedman and Jonathan Sebring).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the commenters, except Mr. Sebring, generally believed motion in a restraint system will benefit safety. Mr.
Koziatek believed that changes in vehicle interiors (e.g., air bags, three-point belts, more restricted occupant
space) have made it more difficult for child restraints to protect the child occupant, and that permitting motion
will help attenuate the deceleration forces in a crash in a manner that is more beneficial than other means. (He did
not specify those other means.) Century emphasized its belief that permitting motion will enable the manufacture
of restraints that can transport children with positional apnea.

In the more medically correct position. That is, by transporting the child in a more horizontal position, those seven
percent of children born that are considered low birth weight will be at a lower risk.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters expressed qualified support. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety believed the idea of movement
in a rear-facing child restraint ``has much to recommend it.'' However, the commenter was concerned about possible
adverse side effects resulting from the change in adjustment position, such as from abrupt movement of the restraint,
and movement that can cause injury to fingers. Similarly, Ford said it ``supports the concept that allowing controlled
change of adjusted position during dynamic testing may reap safety benefits, but suggests that further evaluation
of the concept be conducted.'' Ford expressed concern about the effect of an abrupt cessation of the movement of the
child restraint, such as if the restraint were to rotate into the instrument panel. ``An abrupt stop to the rotation
of the restraint, for example, could result in significant dummy neck tension.'' The American Academy of Pediatrics
stated that it supports NHTSA's efforts to amend Standard 213 to allow for the development of rear-facing restraints
that can safely transport premature and low-weight infants in a less upright position. However, that commenter said
there should be restrictions on the amount and type of movement that is allowed, because sudden movement from a horizontal
to an upright position can be difficult for a medically fragile child. The Academy was also concerned about protecting
the fingers and hands of both the child occupant and adjacent children from injury from exposed openings.

Mr. Sebring commented on the NPRM after reviewing what he said was a video animation of Century's new restraint exhibited
at a juvenile products show. Mr. Sebring was concerned that a child in a restraint that changes adjustment position
can experience acceleration levels on its chest cavity that are not experienced with current restraints. The commenter
suggested NHTSA adopt a rule that permits motion only after analyzing data from a test dummy that measures G forces,
and specify limits on the G forces that are imposed on a dummy placed in the restraint.

Agency Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is amending S5.1.1(b) of Standard 213 to remove the restriction against an infant restraint's changing adjustment
position during testing. The agency believes safety will not be degraded by this amendment, since a provision has
been adopted to minimize possible safety risks resulting from a restraint's changing adjustment positions in a crash.
That provision relates to the closing of exposed openings. The agency will examine infant restraint accident data
and consider appropriate action if changing the position of an infant restraint's seating surface has any adverse
effect on safety. At present, NHTSA does not know of any information indicating the possibility of a negative safety
impact. In fact, NHTSA believes there are several potential positive impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those positive impacts were discussed in the NPRM as reasons why the agency was reexamining the prohibition against
change of adjustment position during testing. Since the 1970's, when the prohibition was adopted, more has been learned
about the proper positioning of apnea-prone children in car seats. Century documented the need for infant restraints
that position apnea-prone infants in a more horizontal position. The agency concludes S5.1.1(b) should be amended
so that it does not impede the development of new child seat designs for apnea-prone infants. NHTSA recognizes that
the market for infant restraints that change adjustment positions may extend beyond the parents of apnea-prone children,
and that this may result in a greater number of infants being exposed to the effects of the new type of infant restraint
with its changing adjustment position. However, the agency is unable to estimate the extent of the possible appeal
to the greater population of parents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates requested information about ``the number of premature and low-birth weight infants who are at risk because
they are being transported in currently marketed child restraints.'' According to the Vital and Health Statistics
Report of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 6.9 percent of the 3,910,000 births in 1988 were of low birth
weight (``low birth weight'' is defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces)). That is a total
of 267,790 babies. In 1989, the low birth rate increased to 7 percent, resulting in 282,868 low-birth weight babies
out of 4,040,972 babies.

Another factor that changed since the 1970's is the change in vehicle seat designs that have occurred in recent years.
As explained above and in the NPRM, vehicle seat designs have changed such that infants typically are positioned more
upright in infant restraints placed in current model vehicles than in vehicles of the late 1970's and early 1980's.
A restraint that enables the child to ride in a more reclined position than a conventional infant restraint could enhance
the transportation of infants generally, and could benefit apnea-prone children in particular.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also considered the interaction of infant restraints with air bags in deciding to issue this rule. Ford
stated that it is possible that an infant restraint could be developed that would reduce the risk of interaction with
an air bag, if the restraint could keep the infant in a supine position below the level of air bag inflation, prior to
movement to a more vertical position. However, Ford also noted it is possible that an air bag would likely begin to inflate
before or shortly after a movable rear-facing infant restraint would begin to move into a more vertical position.
``Movement of the infant seat to a vertical position would likely be somewhat limited by the inflating air bag.*&blank;*&blank;*''
The American Academy of Pediatrics expressed its desire to see an infant restraint that can be safely used with an air
bag. ``If the opportunity to develop a child restraint that utilizes movement proves to improve this serious incompatibility
problem, we certainly would be in favor of such a device.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While at present there is no infant restraint that can be safely used with an air bag, vehicle and child restraint manufacturers
have undertaken research to develop compatible restraint systems. Ford's comment illustrates that an amendment
to permit motion in infant restraints could provide some of the needed flexibility to vehicle and infant seat manufacturers
to improve present vehicle and infant seat designs to achieve compatibility. While Ford did not seem to believe motion
in an infant seat such as that provided for by this rule would in itself achieve compatibility, NHTSA hopes that air
bag-compatible infant restraints will be developed in the near future. Century has demonstrated the practicability
of a design that can meet both the need of an infant to be upright in a crash and the need to be supine while under normal
driving circumstances. NHTSA believes today's amendment might act as a catalyst for the development of infant seat
designs that use motion to manage crash forces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Mr. Sebring's concerns that a child in an infant restraint that changes adjustment positions during
a test can experience acceleration levels on its chest cavity that are not experienced with current restraints, no
information was submitted to support this assertion. Further, given that there is no information showing there will
be potential safety problems with restraints that change adjustment position, NHTSA does not agree that this rulemaking
should be delayed pending research on a test dummy that measures G forces experienced by occupants of these restraints.

Forward-Facing Restraints
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted the prohibition against changing adjustment positions during testing to be removed for
all types of child restraints. Century, Ford, and Mr. Koziatek suggested removing the prohibition for forward-facing
toddler restraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided not to permit change in adjustment position for other types of restraints. Today's amendment permits
such change for rear-facing child seats only. In the case of convertible seats with an infant mode, change would be
permitted in the infant mode only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's reasons for adopting the amendment, discussed in the preceding section, are relevant to infant restraints,
but not other child restraints. This amendment does not eliminate the prohibition for forward-facing child seats
because there is insufficient reason for doing so. In addition to preventing a child's fingers or limbs from being
caught between the shifting parts of the restraint, the prohibition serves to prevent a child seated in a forward-facing
child restraint from submarining (i.e., sliding too far forward and downward, legs first) during the crash. The prohibition
has been an effective and simple approach to accomplishing those purposes. There is no information that weighs in
favor of removing the prohibition for forward-facing restraints, such as information indicating that a change in
adjustment position could protect forward-facing children from injury from an inflating air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Friedman suggested removing the prohibition for car beds. He also suggested S5.1.1 of Standard 213 be amended
to permit ``permanent deformation'' of the interior surface of a restraint as a means of providing crash protection
for the occupant. Mr. Friedman's suggestions are outside the scope of the rulemaking, and have not been adopted by
this rule.

during testing must be unidirectional rotation or translation. Several commenters addressed this issue. Century
requested that the rule permit the child seat to reverse its direction during the dynamic test of Standard 213. According
to the petitioner:

Ford said NHTSA should ``evaluate the risks involved in abrupt cessation of the movement of the child restraint.''
(NHTSA assumes the reference to ``abrupt cessation'' relates to what Ford believed would result from the proposed
requirement that the movement must be unidirectional rotation or translation.) In contrast, Mr. Sebring believed
the motion must be only unidirectional rotation or translation. The commenter believed ``there are obvious bending
moments produced in the occupant's neck as a result of whiplash action which occurs when the restraint returns post-impact
to its original horizontal position.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to adopt the unidirectional requirement. The agency agrees with
Century that it would make sense for the infant restraint to return to its original horizontal position after a crash.
If the restraint did not return to the original position, an apnea-prone infant restrained in the seat would remain
in the upright position, which is the position the child should not be in for any prolonged period of time. Also, having
the restraint return to the supine position may be beneficial in a multiple impact crash if the restraint rotated upright
in the second or subsequent impact. The movement from a supine to a nearly upright position could help dissipate the
stored kinetic energy during the crash because part of the energy of the crash may be consumed by the motion of the restraint
(in changing adjustment position). Part of the energy of the crash may also be consumed by frictional forces of the
restraint's moving parts, e.g., springs and other mechanisms, that may be used to engage the movement of the child
seating surface.

Mr. Sebring's comment in support of a unidirectional requirement accorded with NHTSA's tentative determination
in the NPRM that a unidirectional requirement could minimize possible stresses on the neck of the infant. However,
NHTSA has concluded there is insufficient information on this issue justifying a unidirectional requirement, particularly
in view of the potential benefits (discussed in the preceding paragraph) of permitting an infant restraint to return
to the original horizontal position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Sebring believed that the return of the restraint to the original horizontal position will result in ``obvious
bending moments'' in the occupant's neck ``as a result of whiplash action.'' Information supporting this assertion
is unavailable. To evaluate the claims of Mr. Sebring, NHTSA requested that Century provide a copy of the videotape
that Century presented at the juvenile products show that Mr. Sebring attended. (NHTSA has placed the video Century
provided in NHTSA Docket Number 74&hyph;09; Notice 30.) Contrary to the commenter's description about what he allegedly
saw happening to a dummy restrained in Century's restraint, the video did not show any dummy occupying the displayed
child restraint. NHTSA was unable to clarify Mr. Sebring's comment. The agency repeatedly attempted to contact Mr.
Sebring for information clarifying the references to the videotape and to the ``obvious bending moments'' it appeared
he saw, but NHTSA could not reach Mr. Sebring at his given telephone number, and there was no listing for him in the given
area code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, the agency's evaluation of the film provided by Century did not reveal movement in the child restraint
that would cause ``obvious bending moments'' in the neck of a child occupant. Nevertheless, while there is no information
at this time indicating a safety need to adopt a unidirectional requirement for the motion of the restraint, NHTSA
will monitor accident data to evaluate whether neck injuries are occurring in infant seats that change adjustment
position in a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Academy of Pediatrics suggested that there should be some restrictions on the amount and type of movement
allowed.

It is important that moveable parts should not be able to move too easily and should move only upon impact. Sudden movement
from a horizontal to an upright position can be difficult for a medically fragile child and should only occur when absolutely
necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is not specifying limits on the ease with which an infant restraint can change adjustment position. The agency
believes such limits are unnecessary because as a practical matter, a restraint that too easily changes adjustment
position from the supine to the upright position negates the benefits the restraint is designed to provide to apnea-prone
infants. NHTSA believes that manufacturers who wish to market restraints for apnea-prone infants will not design
a restraint that ends up transporting the infants in a position that is too upright for their breathing condition.
Also, NHTSA believes that manufacturers have a commercial incentive to design a suitable threshold force into the
restraint to trigger the release mechanism, since a restraint that too easily changes adjustment positions could
appear unsafe, uncomfortable and thus unattractive to consumers. In any event, NHTSA will also evaluate the performance
of these restraints and monitor accident data on this issue, to see whether a safety need emerges to limit how easily
an infant restraint can change adjustment position.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters addressed the proposal to prohibit openings that are exposed and are at least 1/4 inch in diameter
before the testing from becoming smaller during testing due to the movement of the seating surface relative to the
restraint system as a whole. Most of these commenters supported the proposal. Century requested that openings greater
than 1/4 inch in diameter should be permitted to become smaller if the opening is no smaller than 11/2 inches at the conclusion
of testing. The commenter did not provide information on why that value would be more appropriate than the proposed
value. Since a child or adult seated next to a rotating infant seat can be injured if a hand were caught in an opening whose
diameter were reduced to 11/2 inches, Century's request is denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On a related matter, the agency wishes to clarify a statement in the NPRM. NHTSA indicated a belief in the NPRM that changes
in child seat designs (from exposed tubular steel frames to molded plastic ones) might have obviated the safety need
for a prohibition against a change in adjustment position. Two commenters did not agree with that statement. The American
Academy of Pediatrics said it was not convinced that the risk of injury to a child's fingers has been removed because
of the type of material from which restraints are presently made. Mr. Sebring said a return to tubular steel frames
could occur in the future, especially since future designs could be patterned after the ``ISO&hyph;FIX,'' a child
restraint system that the European community is developing with standardized features for installation in vehicles.
Mr. Sebring believes features of the ISO&hyph;FIX design could necessitate a return to tubular steel frames, if the
design were eventually used in this country. (He did not specify the features to which he referred.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify the agency's statement, the agency believed that the type of child restraint design made possible through
the use of plastic molded frames might have obviated the need for the requirement in question. However, NHTSA has reconsidered
this issue. The agency concludes that a requirement protecting against injury to fingers and hands due to shifting
child restraint parts is needed to ensure present and future child seat designs do not have dangerous parts that can
trap and injure hands and fingers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety suggested that NHTSA require that the printed instructions accompanying a
rear-facing restraint designed for children with apnea or other breathing problems include information on how these
children should be positioned while being transported in a motor vehicle. That suggestion is beyond the scope of the
NPRM and has not been adopted. Advocates also suggested that NHTSA require that the printed instructions include
information telling the consumer not to impede the ability of the restraint to change adjustment position. The agency
concludes that requiring this information for infant restraints that are designed to change adjustment position
is within the scope of the rulemaking. The information relates to the real-world operation of the restraint in a crash.
This rulemaking, which permits the manufacture of a new type of infant restraint system, rests on NHTSA's conclusion
that the new system can afford adequate crash protection provided that the restraint changes adjustment position
in a crash. If the movement of the restraint's seating surface were to be impeded by the consumer in some manner, the
primary means of crash protection provided by the restraint would be negated. It is crucial that the consumer not impede
the movement of the restraint, and be instructed on the matter. Therefore, such instructions will be required.

This rule is effective 30 days after its publication date. The shorter than usual effective date is based on the effect
of the amendment to relieve design restrictions and facilitate the manufacture of a new type of infant seat. Because
the rule relieves a restriction, there is good cause for making it effective in 30 days.

This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered
the impacts of this rulemaking action and has determined that this action is not ``significant'' within the meaning
of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has further determined that the
effects of this rulemaking are so minimal that preparation of a full preliminary regulatory evaluation is not warranted.
The agency believes that manufacturers will be minimally affected by this rulemaking because it simply permits new
designs in infant restraints and does not require any design change or impose additional costs on manufacturers.
Manufacturers that do not want to manufacture an infant restraint that can change adjustment positions will not be
affected.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency knows of fourteen
manufacturers of child restraints, seven of which NHTSA considers to be small businesses (including Kolcraft, which
with an estimated 500 employees, is on the borderline of being a small business). These businesses do not comprise
a substantial number of small entities that are affected by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the number of small businesses, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities.
The rule will affect manufacturers only if they choose to manufacture an infant restraint that can change adjustment
positions in Standard 213's dynamic test. The amendment may benefit manufacturers by allowing them to manufacture
and sell a new product. However, based on manufacturers' responses to the NPRM, it does not appear that manufacturers
other than Century will manufacture and sell such a product. The amendment may provide benefits to apnea-prone children
by allowing manufacturers to produce an infant restraint that can position these children in a manner more appropriate
for their condition. However, the agency does not have information to estimate those possible benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions procure infant restraints for programs such as loaner programs.
NHTSA does not believe the costs of infant restraints will be increased by this rule. Thus, these entities will not
be significantly affected by this rule.

This rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not
adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal
standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to
vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial
review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does
not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may
file suit in court.

 NMFS issues this notification to announce that the summer flounder commercial quota available to the State of Delaware
has been harvested. Vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for the summer flounder fishery may no longer land summer
flounder in the State of Delaware for the remainder of calendar year 1994, unless additional quota becomes available
through a transfer. Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery require publication of this notification
to advise the State of Delaware that its quota has been harvested and to advise vessel and dealer Federal permit holders
that no commercial quota is available for landing summer flounder in the State.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification
of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the
annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state is described in &sect;625.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year is set equal to 16,005,560 pounds (7,257,441
kg) (March 7, 1994, 59 FR 10586). The percent allocated to vessels landing summer flounder in Delaware is 0.01779 percent
or 2,847 pounds (1,290.9 kg).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 625.20(d) provides that any overages of the commercial quota landed in any state will be deducted from that
state's annual quota for the following year. In calendar year 1993, a total of 6,403 pounds (2,903 kg) was landed in
Delaware. The amount allocated for Delaware landings in 1993 was 2,197 pounds (996 kg), creating an overage of 4,206
pounds (1,907 kg) that must be deducted from the amount allocated for landings in Delaware during 1994.

Section 625.21(c) requires the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to monitor state commercial
quotas and to determine when a state commercial quota is harvested. The Regional Director is further required to publish
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 advising a state and notifying Federal vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a specific date, the
state's commercial quota has been harvested and no commercial quota is available for landing summer flounder in that
state. Because the amount that must be deducted from the Delaware allocation exceeds the amount allocated in 1994,
the Regional Director has determined that the 1994 summer flounder quota allocation for vessels landing in Delaware
has been harvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at &sect;625.4(a)(3) provide that Federal permit holders agree as a condition of the permit not to
land summer flounder in any state that the Regional Director has determined no longer has commercial quota available.
Therefore, effective 0001 hours March 30, 1994, further landings in Delaware by Federally permitted vessels are
prohibited for the remainder of the 1994 calendar year, unless additional quota becomes available through a transfer
and is announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Federally permitted dealers are also advised that, effective the date above, they may not purchase summer flounder
from Federally permitted vessels that land in Delaware for the remainder of the calendar year, or until additional
quota becomes available.
