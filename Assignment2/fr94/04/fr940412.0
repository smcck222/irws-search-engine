SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes requirements for red variety onions grown in South Texas under Marketing Order 959. In
recent years, shipments of poor quality red onions have appeared in the marketplace and have adversely affected grower
prices. This rule will tend to improve grower prices by providing more desirable quality red onions for consumers.
This rule also extends the termination date of the order's regulatory period from May 20 to June 15 of each year. More
late season onions are being grown in a portion of the production area, increasing the need for marketing order quality
requirements over a longer time period. Regulating onions from the production area through June 15 will help make
more desirable onions available to markets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Marketing Order No. 959 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 CFR Part 959), as amended, regulating the handling of onions grown in South Texas, hereinafter referred to as the
``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 38 handlers of South Texas onions who are subject to regulation under the marketing order and 97 producers
in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers, have been defined by the Small
Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural
producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of South Texas onions may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its November 9, 1993, meeting, the South Texas Onion Committee (committee) recommended, under the authority of
&sect;959.52(c) of the order, that red varieties of onions be regulated and also that the termination date of the regulatory
period for all varieties of regulated onions be extended from May 20 to June 15 of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Red varieties of onions have been exempt from regulation since the inception of Marketing Order No. 959. The quantities
of such onions produced have usually represented a small portion of the total annual production in the marketing order's
regulated area. However, red variety acreage has increased significantly in recent seasons. Moreover, the committee
reports that poor quality red onions grown in the production area have appeared in the marketplace from time to time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact on the industry is two-fold. Poor quality red onions diminish consumer confidence in the better quality
red onions, leading to fewer sales and lower returns to growers. In addition, a less favorable consumer opinion of
red variety onions often leads to lower sales for all onions grown in the production area, including yellow and white
varieties which now enjoy an excellent reputation with receivers and consumers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Red onions, like yellow onions and white onions, are varieties of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allium cepa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and are therefore covered by the same U.S. standards referenced in &sect;959.322(h). Because of this, the regulatory
requirements set forth in &sect;959.322 applicable to yellow and white varieties of onions are appropriate for red
varieties also. The committee believes that by regulating red onions in the same fashion as yellow and white onions,
consumers can be assured of buying better quality red onions. Thus, increased consumer confidence should result
in improved returns to growers. In addition to grade and size requirements, the committee also recommended that red
varieties be subject to the same pack, container, inspection, assessment, and safeguard requirements as yellow
and white varieties. In this way, red, yellow, and white onions will be regulated to the same extent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second recommendation concerns the length of the regulatory period for shipments of onions from the regulated
area. Previously, order regulations were in effect from March 1 through May 20 each year. District 2 (Laredo-Winter
Garden) is in the northern part of the production area and has a shipping season that extends from May to well into June.
This district is comprised of the Counties of Zapata, Webb, Jim Hogg, DeWitt, Wilson, Atascosa, Karnes, Val Verde,
Frio, Kinney, Uvalde, Medina, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit and LaSalle. In the 1980's, District 2 production was declining
and industry members asked to be relieved from the marketing order requirements after May 20 each season, instead
of the June 15 date in effect at that time. By May 20, shipments from District No. 1 in the southern part of the production
area usually are finished. Thus, effective for the 1989 and subsequent seasons, the termination date for the regulatory
period was advanced for the entire production area from June 15 to May 20 (54 FR 8519, March 1, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, committee records indicate an increase in onion shipments from District 2 during the past three years. The
committee members from District 2 who attended the November meeting stated that shipments during the May 20 through
June 15 period should once again be regulated so that funds could be assessed to fund the committee's production research
and market development efforts as well as assure the consumer a quality pack of onions from their district. Shipments
from this district typically account for 10 to 12 percent of the production area total, and the committee believes
that grade, size, container, and other order requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of South Texas onions
that receivers and consumers have become accustomed to. Extension of the regulatory period will not affect District
1 handlers as shipments from that district normally are completed by mid-May. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, handlers may not package or load onions on Sunday during the period March 1 through May 20 of each season.
The committee recommended not changing this requirement. After May 20, District 2 handlers compete with unregulated
shipments from other areas such as California. Permitting District 2 handlers to package and ship whenever they can
find buyers will help to reduce the competitive advantage of handlers shipping from outside the regulated area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of this final rule was published in the March 9, 1994, issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11008). Interested persons were invited to file written comments with respect to the proposal until March 24,
1994. Ten comments were received. One was from Mr. Greg Nelson, of the Cargil Produce Company, Uvalde, Texas, which
is located in District 2. Mr. Nelson opposed the extension of the regulatory period. He stated that non-regulated
areas such as California, the Vidalia area of Georgia, New Mexico, Arizona, and the Trans-Pecos area of Texas ship
large quantities of new crop onions. These onions compete with regulated onions from District 2 (Laredo-Winter Garden).
Mr. Nelson stated that the other shipping areas, being unregulated, have a significant competitive advantage over
District 2 growers and handlers because those onions do not have to meet grade requirements and the handlers do not
have to pay inspection costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six other comments also opposed the proposed extension of the regulation period. These comments were received from
Mr. Kenneth Spence, Mr. Robert Willoughby, and Mr. Lee Toombs, all of Batesville; and from Mr. C.W. Cargil, Mr. Steve
Cargil, and Mr. Steve Rambie, from Uvalde, Texas. All stated that regulating District 2 onions after May 20 would cause
a hardship on District 2 growers by giving non-regulated producing areas a competitive advantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the November 9, 1993, meeting during which this change in regulatory period was recommended, 11 members were present;
the full committee is composed of 17 members. The committee unanimously recommended this action, including two members
from District 2. For District 1, one position was not represented by either a member or alternate; for District 2, two
members out of seven were in attendance. None of the opponents were in attendance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although District 2 producers and handlers usually face competition from non-regulated areas during much of their
shipping season, it is important that handling requirements apply to shipments from that district to protect the
good quality image enjoyed by South Texas onions in the marketplace and promoted by the committee's market development
program. In the absence of quality and inspection requirements, low quality onions from District 2 could be shipped.
Such shipments could negatively effect the South Texas industry's market development efforts and quality image.
Also, in the interest of equity and uniform regulation application, it is desirable that handlers from District 2
pay assessments in support of these activities. Assessments paid have helped to provide an on-going production research
program that has benefitted the entire industry with the development of new onion varieties and new cultural techniques,
as well as an effective market development program that helps increase sales. Therefore, these comments are denied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three remaining comments were from the South Texas Onion committee, Mr. John R. Bearden, and Mr. B. L. Lackey. These
comments stated that if the rule is not adopted by April 1, the anticipated beginning of the red onion harvesting and
shipping season, poor quality red onions will be dumped on the market, thereby diminishing consumer confidence and
depressing the market for South Texas onions. After evaluating the comments, the Department has decided to implement
the committee's recommendation as proposed, and make the final rule effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality or maturity requirements are in effect for onions
under a domestic marketing order, imported onions must meet the same or comparable requirements, subject to concurrence
by the United States Trade Representative. Because this rule establishes grade, size, quality and maturity requirements
on red onions and changes the regulatory period under the South Texas onion marketing order, corresponding changes
are needed in the onion import regulation. Such changes have been addressed in a separate onion import rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0074. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the proposal submitted by the committee, comments
received, and other information, it is hereby found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this
section until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because (1) the shipping season for onions has already begun and for maximum effectiveness this rule should apply
to as many shipments as possible; (2) the proposed rule was discussed at an open public meeting, and all interested
persons had an opportunity to voice concerns; and (3) there are no special preparations required of the handler that
cannot be completed by the effective date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 10, 1992, the Commission sent to Congress new rules on special fundraising projects and other uses of candidate
names by unauthorized committees. The rules prohibit the use of a candidate's name in the title of any fundraising
project or other communication by any committee that has not been authorized by the named candidate. 11 CFR 102.14(a).
The rules became effective on November 4, 1992. 57 FR 47258 (Oct. 15, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules construe 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(4), a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act [``FECA'' or ``the Act'']
that prohibits the use of a candidate's name in the name of an unauthorized political committee. Prior to the 1992 revision,
the Commission had construed this prohibition as applying only to the name under which a committee registers with
the Commission [the ``registered name''].

On February 5, 1993, the Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking from Citizens Against David Duke [``CADD''],
a proposed project of the American Ideas Foundation. The petition requested that the Commission reconsider and repeal
the new rules, with particular emphasis on those titles that indicate opposition to, rather than support for, a named
candidate.

In response to these comments, the Commission published an NPRM proposing that the rule be amended so as to permit the
use of candidate names in titles that clearly indicate opposition to the named candidate. 58 FR 65559 (Dec. 15, 1993).
The Commission received four comments in response to this Notice, three of which reflected in whole or in part comments
submitted earlier in the course of the rulemaking.

842 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Commission's
authority to interpret the prohibition at 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(4) on the use of a candidate's name in the name of an unauthorized
committee as applying only to the name under which the committee registered with the Commission, since ``[an] agency's
construction, if reasonable, must ordinarily be honored.''

at 439&hyph;40. However, the court recognized that an interpretation imposing a more extensive ban on the use of candidate
names by unauthorized committees, such as prohibiting their use in the titles of any fundraising projects sponsored
by an unauthorized committee, ``could also be accommodated within the provision's literal language.''

Some commenters on both the 1992 and the current NPRM noted that this rulemaking implicates protected first amendment
rights, and that any infringement on these rights is subject to strict scrutiny by reviewing courts. However, it is
well established that first amendment rights are not absolute when balanced against the government's interest in
protecting the integrity of the electoral process. ``Even a `significant interference' with protected rights [&blank;]
may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid
unnecessary abridgment'' of those rights.

The

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision grew out of the 1980 presidential election. Since that time, the Commission has become increasingly concerned
over the possibility for confusion or abuse under the interpretation upheld in that case, that is, limiting the FECA's
``name'' prohibition to a committee's registered name. Aware of these constitutional concerns, the 1992 NPRM sought
comments on two modifications to the rules then in effect that fell short of an overall ban.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the first proposal, the political committee sponsoring the project would have been required to include in the
required disclaimer the name of the committee paying for the project, as well as a statement whether the project had
been authorized by the candidate whose name appeared in the title, or by any other candidate. As part of this proposal,
the Commission also sought comments on whether disclaimer size and/or location requirements should be imposed in
this situation. Second, a committee would not have been allowed to accept checks received in response to a special
project solicitation, unless the checks were made payable to the registered name of the committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Commission also sought comments on a proposed total bar on the use of a candidate's name in the project
title of an unauthorized committee's special fundraising project; and several commenters endorsed this approach.
After considering all comments received in response to that Notice, the Commission decided that the total ban was
justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains substantial evidence that potential contributors often confuse an unauthorized
committee's registered name with the names of its fundraising projects, and wrongly believe that their contributions
will be used in support of the candidate(s) named in the project titles. Although one commenter on the present rulemaking
stated that the Commission had overstated the potential for fraud and abuse in this area, no comment provided information
to refute this earlier determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is narrowly designed to further the legitimate governmental interest in minimizing the possibility of
fraud and abuse in this situation. Committees are not barred from establishing specially designated projects: They
are free to choose whatever project title they desire, as long as it does not include the name of a federal candidate.
Also, committees may freely discuss any number of candidates, by name, in the body of a communication. The newly-revised
rule further enhances unauthorized committees' constitutional rights by exempting from the ban those titles that
clearly indicate opposition to the named candidate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear from the rulemaking record that the situation today differs significantly from that of the early 1980's,
when the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Common Cause
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case was litigated. Prior to the adoption of the 1992 rules, the use of candidate names in the titles of projects or other
unauthorized communications had increasingly become a device for unauthorized committees to raise funds or disseminate
information. Under the former interpretation, a candidate who objected to the use of his or her name in this manner,
who shared in none of the funds received in response to the solicitation, and/or who disagreed with the views expressed
in the communication, was largely powerless to stop it. For example, in 1984 a United States Senator requested, and
received, permission to obtain from Commission records the names and addresses of those who had responded to unauthorized
solicitations made in his name, to inform these contributors that he had not authorized the solicitation. However,
he could not suggest that contributors send donations instead to his campaign committee. See Advisory Opinion 1984&hyph;2.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An examination of the record in the 1992 rulemaking, which contains information that was not available when that NPRM
was put out for comment, further supports the Commission's conclusion that this balance has now shifted so as to justify
a broader interpretation. For example, a comment from an authorized committee of a major party presidential candidate
stated that an unauthorized project using that candidate's name raised over $10,000,000 during the 1988 presidential
election cycle, despite the candidate's disavowal of and efforts to stop these activities. The same unauthorized
committee was raising money by means of a comparable project, using that same candidate's name, in the 1992 election
cycle. This comment added that two other unauthorized projects by that same committee raised over $4,000,000 and
nearly $400,000 in the name of two other presidential candidates in the 1988 election cycle. None of the named candidates
received any of the money that was collected in their names. One of these candidates, a United States Senator, also
submitted comments asking that the pertinent rules be strengthened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a television documentary, a videotape of which was placed in the rulemaking record, detailed how an unauthorized
Political Action Committee had, over several election cycles, established numerous projects whose titles included
the names of federal candidates. The named candidates had no connection with the projects, had not authorized the
use of their names in this manner, and received no money from the $9 million raised in response to these appeals. Program
investigators found that elderly people are particularly vulnerable to being misled in this manner, since they may
not notice or fail to fully comprehend the disclaimers included with the solicitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such cases point up the potential for confusion or abuse when an unauthorized committee uses a candidate's name in
the title of a special fundraising project, or other designation under which the committee operates. A person who
receives such a communication may confuse the project name with the committee's registered name, and thus may not
understand that the communication is made on behalf of the unauthorized committee rather than the candidate whose
name appears in the project's title. Potential donors may think they are giving money to the candidate named in the
project's title, when this is not the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments that opposed any modifications to the former standard argued that current disclaimer requirements
at section 441d(a)(3) were sufficient to minimize the potential for confusion in this area. Others suggested stronger,
or larger, disclaimers, in place of the overall ban. One suggested that the disclaimer be in as large and as bold a typeface
as the largest, boldest use of the candidate's name anywhere in the communication. The Commission believes that such
an approach could be more burdensome than the current ban, while still not solving the potential for fraud and abuse
in this area. The requirement that checks be made only to the sponsoring committee's registered name would similarly
not ensure that the contributor did not erroneously believe the money would be used to support the candidate(s) named
in the project's title. It also would be difficult, if not practically impossible, to monitor and enforce, since nothing
on the public record reflects who the payee is on a contributor's check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the ban applies only to project titles, and not to the body of the accompanying communication.
Unauthorized committees remain free to discuss candidates throughout the communication; and to use candidates'
names as frequently, and highlight them as prominently (in terms of size, typeface, location, and so forth) as they
choose. In other words, while a committee could not establish a fundraising project called ``Citizens for Doe,''
if Doe is a federal candidate, it could use a subheading such as ``Help Us Elect Doe to Federal Office,'' and urge Doe's
election, by name, in large, highlighted type, throughout the communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, by amending the regulation to exclude from the ban names that indicate opposition to the named candidate, the
Commission has acceded to the petitioner's main concern, amending the rules to permit the American Ideas Foundation
to use the names of federal candidates in titles that clearly indicate opposition to such candidates. As stated in
its summary of the petition (petition, p. 1), ``There is no danger of confusion or abuse inherent in the use of a candidate's
name by a committee or project which opposes the candidate.'' The Commission recognizes that the potential for fraud
and abuse is significantly reduced in the case of such titles, and has accordingly revised its rules to permit them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition also asked that the rule exclude from the ban the use of candidate names in titles by those committees ``that
are authorized to use the candidate's name, which are engaged in activities which will not actively mislead the public
or injure the candidate, or which otherwise clearly indicate that they are unauthorized.'' However, if a candidate
authorizes the use of his or her name in a fundraising project, the committee becomes an authorized committee, and
this rule would not apply. The phrase ``engaged in activities which will not actively mislead the public or injure
the candidate'' is vague and would result in the need to determine on a case-by-case basis whether covered communications
met this test. The Commission has already determined that a stronger disclaimer requirement would not be sufficient
in and of itself to meet this concern. Given the wide range of options that committees continue to have regarding use
of candidate names, imposing further requirements could well prove more burdensome than the present approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed that exempted titles would have to ``clearly and unambiguously [show] opposition to the named candidate
by using words such as `defeat' or `oppose.''' The requirement that such specific ``triggering words'' be included
in the title has been deleted from the final rule, since the Commission recognizes that certain titles, such as ``Citizens
Fed Up with Doe,'' may clearly and unambiguously indicate opposition to a candidate even though no individual word
in the title has that import.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter argued that legislative action is necessary to effectuate this change, noting that the Commission
has in the past included this issue in the legislative recommendations it submits to Congress each year. However,
it is well established that courts will not rely on an agency's legislative recommendation to undermine the agency's
construction of a statute as authorizing it to act. The Supreme Court has stated that holding an agency's legislative
recommendation against it is disfavored, because ``[p]ublic policy requires that agencies feel free to ask [Congress
for] legislation,'' and this freedom to act would be chilled if such requests could later be held against them.

The Commission notes that David Duke is not currently a candidate for federal office, so the use of his name in a project
title is not prohibited by these rules. Should he again become a federal candidate, such use of his name would be governed
by these revised rules.

This final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for
this certification is that any small entities affected are already required to comply with the Act's requirements
in this area. Also, the rule broadens the Commission's interpretation of these requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is finalizing the updates of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 7, 1994 and February 8, 1994. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward
boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore
area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), as amended by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS Air Regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS
sources for which the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (San Luis Obispo County APCD), the Santa
Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa Barbara APCD), the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(South Coast AQMD), and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated
COAs. The intended effect of approving the requirements contained in ``San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control
District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (March 11, 1994), ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994 at 59 FR 994 and February 8, 1994 at 59 FR 5745, EPA proposed to approve the following requirements
into the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: ``San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District Requirements
applicable to OCS Sources'', ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to
OCS Sources'', ``South Coast Air Quality Management District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'', and ``Ventura
County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources''. These requirements represent
the third update of part 55 and are being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules from local air pollution
control agencies. EPA has evaluated the above requirements to ensure that they are rationally related to the attainment
or maintenance of Federal or state ambient air quality standards or part C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed
expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1.
EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious. 40 CFR 55.12(e). In addition,
EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 30-day public comment period was provided at 59 FR 994 and 59 FR 5745 and no comments were received.

EPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this document, EPA takes final action to incorporate the proposed changes into 40 CFR part 55. One minor change was
made to the proposal set forth in the January 7, 1994 and February 8, 1994 notices of proposed rulemaking. This change
includes the addition of a document date for the requirements to be incorporated into part 55. EPA is approving the
submittal as modified under section 328(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7627. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA
establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries
that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable
onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore.

Administrative Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12291 (Regulatory Impact Analysis)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.
This exemption continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities
include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was stated in the final OCS regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the
rule averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in the
final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.

 The State of Texas has applied for final authorization of a revision to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Texas' application
and decided that its hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for
final authorization. Unless adverse written comments are received during the review and comment period provided
for public participation in this process, EPA intends to approve Texas' hazardous waste program revision, subject
to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Texas' application
for the program revision is available for public review and comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or ``the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows
States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated
under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive interim authorization for the HSWA requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR 260&hyph;266, 268, 124, and 270.

Texas received final authorization to implement its hazardous waste management program on December 12, 1984, effective
December 26, 1984 (see 49 FR 48300). This authorization was clarified in a notice published in the FR on March 26, 1985
(see 50 FR 11858). Texas received final authorization for revisions to its program in notices published in the FR on
January 31, 1986, effective October 4, 1985 (see 51 FR 3952), on December 18, 1986, effective February 17, 1987 (see
51 FR 45320), on March 1, 1990, effective March 15, 1990 (see 55 FR 7318), on May 24, 1990, effective July 23, 1990 (see
55 FR 21383), on August 22, 1991, effective October 21, 1991 (see 56 FR 41626), and on October 5, 1992, effective December
4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45719). On December 8, 1992, the Texas Water Commission (TWC) submitted a final complete program
revision application for additional program approvals. (In 1991, Texas Senate Bill 2 created the Texas Natural Resources
Conservation Commission (TNRCC) which combined the functions of the former Texas Water Commission and the former
Texas Air Control Board. The transfer of functions to the TNRCC from the two agencies became effective on September
1, 1993. Under Chapter 361 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, the TNRCC has sole responsibility for the administration
of laws and regulations concerning hazardous waste). Today, Texas is seeking approval of its program revision in
accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reviewed Texas' application, and made an immediate final decision that Texas' hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant
final authorization for the additional program modifications to Texas. The public may submit written comments on
EPA's final decision until May 27, 1994. Copies of Texas' application for program revision are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Texas' program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless
an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the
comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate
final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas' program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated
in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR Parts 124, 260&hyph;262, 264, 265, and 270 that were published
in the FR through June 30, 1991. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart below.
This chart also lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.
(As a result of the Texas reorganization presented above, TNRCC rules, once codified at Title 31 Texas Administrative
Code, are now codified at Title 30 Texas Administrative Code).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Texas' application for a program revision meets the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, Texas is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
for carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations
of the HSWA. Texas also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under Section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under Sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.

EPA uses 40 CFR 272 for codification of the decision to authorize Texas' program and for incorporation by reference
of those provisions of Texas' statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under Section 3008, 3013, and 7003 of
RCRA. Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of 40 CFR 272, Subpart E, until a later date.

Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Texas' program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers
of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends the gas, hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline safety regulations to require that certain
new and replacement pipelines be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection
devices (smart pigs). This action was taken in response to a mandate in the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of
1988. The intended effect of these amended regulations is to improve the safety of gas, hazardous liquid and carbon
dioxide pipelines by permitting their inspection by ``smart pigs'' using the latest technology for detecting and
recording abnormalities in the pipe wall.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54745) proposing that new and replacement
gas transmission lines and new and replacement hazardous liquid pipelines and carbon dioxide pipelines be designed
and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. However, the rules would
not apply to specific installations for which such design and construction would be impracticable. In addition,
the NPRM proposed a procedure for operators seeking an administrative ruling on any rule in parts 192, 193 and 195 in
which the administrator is authorized to make a finding or approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM was issued in response to Congressional mandates in sections 108(b) and 207(b) of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization
Act of 1988 (hereinafter ``Reauthorization Act'') (Pub. L. 100&hyph;561; Oct. 31, 1988). Section 108(b) of the Reauthorization
Act amended section 3 of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA) by adding subsection (g), ``Instrumented
Internal Inspection Devices'' (49 app. U.S.C. 1672). This new subsection requires the Secretary of Transportation
to establish regulations requiring that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) The design and construction of new [gas] transmission facilities, and (2) when replacement of existing transmission
facilities or equipment is required, the replacement of such existing facilities, be carried out, to the extent practicable,
in a manner so as to accommodate the passage through such transmission facilities of instrumented internal inspection
devices (commonly referred to as ``smart pigs'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 207(b) of the Reauthorization Act amended section 203 of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979
(HLPSA) (49 app. U.S.C. 2002) to require that DOT establish similar regulations with respect to pipeline facilities
subject to the HLPSA.

Future Rulemaking Involving Smart Pigs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (hereinafter ``PLSA of 1992'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;508; Oct. 24, 1992) in sections 103 and 203 amended the NGPSA and the HLPSA, respectively, by requiring
the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations that require the periodic inspection of gas transmission facilities
and hazardous liquid pipelines in high-density population areas, and hazardous liquid pipelines in environmentally
sensitive areas or crossing navigable waterways. In response to these mandates, RSPA will issue an NPRM proposing
to prescribe the circumstances, if any, under which such inspections would be conducted with smart pigs. In those
circumstances under which an inspection by a smart pig would not be required, RSPA is mandated to require the use of
an inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method that is at least as effective as the use of smart pigs in providing for the safety of the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to require all future new and replacement gas transmission lines subject to 49 CFR part 192
and hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines subject to 49 CFR part 195 to be designed and constructed to accommodate
the passage of smart pigs, except where impracticable. For the purposes of this rulemaking, RSPA proposed that it
would be impracticable to require the accommodation of smart pigs under the following categories of piping: Manifolds,
station piping (such as compressor stations, pump stations, metering stations or regulator stations), cross-overs,
and fittings providing branch line junctures (such as tees and other lateral connections). Additionally, the NPRM
proposed to allow pipeline operators to petition (minimum 90 days in advance) the Administrator, in a particular
case, for a finding that design or construction to accommodate a smart pig would be impracticable.

Advisory Committees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards
Committee (THLPSSC) have been established by statute to evaluate pipeline safety regulations. The TPSSC and the
THLPSSC met in joint session in Washington, DC on August 3, 1993, and considered the NPRM. Both committees accepted
the NPRM as feasible, reasonable, and practicable with the incorporation of several changes. RSPA's disposition
of the advisory committees' recommendations are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RSPA received public comments on the proposed rule change from 48 pipeline operators, seven pipeline-related associations,
three state/Federal agencies, and one consulting engineer. The following discussion explains how RSPA considered
the advisory committees' positions and the public comments on the proposed regulations in developing the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Low Stress Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twenty-three commenters indicated that the rule should except pipelines in which the internal operating pressure
results in low stress in the pipe wall. Many commenters argued that since gas transmission lines are not subject to
certain pipeline safety regulations (&sect;&sect;192.609, 192.711 &amp; 192.713) if they operate at or below 40
percent of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), that this rule should similarly not apply to these same transmission
lines. The TPSSC also recommended that piping operating at a stress level of 40 percent of SMYS or less be excepted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
While RSPA understands this position, it does not agree that it justifies exception of gas transmission lines based
solely on their low hoop stress at maximum operating pressure. Pipelines operating at lower stress levels are as susceptible
to corrosion and other types of damage, identifiable by smart pigs, as pipelines operating at higher stress. In addition,
the Reauthorization Act mandate to require certain new and replacement pipelines to be designed and constructed
to accommodate the passage of smart pigs limits RSPA's discretion only to situations that make such design and construction
impracticable. RSPA finds that an exception from the requirements adopted in this rule for pipelines operating at
or below 40% SMYS is not appropriate, because the pipe wall stress does not, within the terms of the Reauthorization
Act, affect the practicability of designing and constructing a line to accommodate passage of smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Short Lengths 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Eighteen commenters recommended that the rule except new or replacement pipelines based on their short lengths.
Some commenters recommended excepting replacement pipelines depending on whether the adjoining portions of the
pipeline are piggable. One of these commenters reasoned that unless the adjoining portion of pipeline can accommodate
the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices, there can be no added benefit from making a replacement
section piggable because the pipeline overall will still contain restrictions prohibiting inspection by smart
pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters recommended exception of minimum lengths that ranged from 2000 feet to 5 miles. A gas transmission
line operator recommended that the minimum excepted length should be the distance between compressor stations (40
to 60 miles), to exclude the necessity to replace non-full opening valves on short replacement sections. Four commenters
suggested that the minimum excepted length should be determined by RSPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disparity of the commenters' recommendations illustrates that there is no generally accepted rationale for
determining the minimum length, if any, of pipe that should be excepted. Moreover, RSPA does not agree that the rule
should except replacement pipelines based on either the length of the replaced section of pipeline or on whether the
adjoining portion of pipeline can accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plain objective of the statutory mandate is to make both short and long pipelines that are not now piggable from
end to end, piggable in time through replacements. Therefore, the final rule does not include these exceptions. However,
operators wishing to except short length pipelines may want to petition the Administrator under the procedures set
out in the new &sect;190.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Non-Steel Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Five commenters recommended that the rule apply only to steel pipelines. One commenter argued that current internal
inspection devices cannot monitor non-ferrous pipelines for stress corrosion. The commenter contends that no benefit
derives from the running of smart pigs on these lines, and therefore it would be unreasonable to require operators
to make them piggable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter contended that, although some polyethylene gas pipelines are by DOT definition transmission
lines, there are no smart pigs (except camera pigs) that are designed for use in plastic pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that the rule should except non-steel pipelines. It is true that smart pigs cannot presently monitor
non-steel pipelines for as many defects or anomalies as are detectable in steel pipelines. However, smart pigs can
currently detect some physical defects in non-steel pipelines; i.e. dents, change in internal diameter, ovality,
misalignment of joints, and change in position of the pipe. Moreover, by making new and replacement plastic pipelines
piggable, they will be able to accommodate new smart pig technology as it is developed. Nonetheless, all the exceptions
in this rule applicable to steel pipelines are also applicable to non-steel pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Small Diameter Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twenty-four commenters recommended that the rule except the smaller diameter pipelines. Some reasoned that commercially
available smart pig technology is limited to the larger pipe sizes. Consequently, for those sizes of pipe for which
there are no commercially available smart pigs, designing and constructing pipelines to pass smart pigs would be
impracticable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that the rule should include a blanket exception for all small diameter pipelines. In recent years
we have seen the increasing miniaturization of electro-mechanical components in equipment used in smart pigs and
we expect the trend to continue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RSPA understands that where no commercially available technology exists to inspect a particular pipe size by smart
pigs, the pipeline operator would lack sufficient technical information to establish the design and construction
criteria, e.g. minimum internal pipe diameter and minimum pipe bend radius, essential for passage of smart pigs.
Therefore, the final rule has been written to apply only to pipeline diameters for which there is a commercially available
smart pig at the time the new or replacement pipeline is designed. At the time of preparation of this document, RSPA
finds that 4 inches is the minimum nominal pipe size for which smart pigs are commercially available.

Gas Transmission Lines Operated in Conjunction With Distribution Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twelve commenters recommended that the rule except lines classified as transmission lines because their hoop stress
is 20 percent or more of SMYS, that operate in conjunction with gas distribution systems. They reasoned that, typically,
these lines have components and configurations that impede passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters reasoned that many of these transmission lines are the sole gas supply to large gas distribution systems.
So, inspection of these lines by instrumented internal inspection devices could, if problems develop while running
the inspection device, disrupt customer service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that the rule should provide an exception for gas transmission lines that are operated in conjunction
with distribution systems (except as discussed under the heading ``Gas transmission lines in crowded underground
locations''). First, although such lines may have configurations or components that impede inspection by smart
pigs, the commenters did not provide information to substantiate the contention that these conditions are impracticable
to avoid on new or replacement lines. RSPA believes it is practicable to design and construct new and replacement transmission
lines operated in conjunction with distribution systems to accommodate passage of smart pigs. Second, potential
service disruption (from stuck smart pigs) on single feed transmission lines will not be a factor on lines that are
properly designed, constructed and maintained to accommodate smart pigs. Also, to further reduce the possibility
of the smart pig becoming stuck, prior runs can be scheduled, with cleaning and caliper pigs, during periods of minimal
load requirements. Third, the use of smart pigs to monitor the integrity of single feed transmission lines can detect
problems before they can affect the reliability of the gas supply to the customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Gas Transmission Lines in Crowded Underground Locations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twelve commenters recommended that RSPA except gas transmission lines located in certain urban areas. Most of them
pointed out that utility locations underneath city streets in downtown urban areas are typically overcrowded. Physical
constraints from other utilities and the structural boundary of available space make the design and construction
of replacement pipelines to accommodate smart pigs impracticable. For example, many underground utility locations
lack sufficient clearance between existing utilities to allow the replacement of existing short radius elbows with
longer radius elbows (which consume more space) to permit passage of smart pigs. Nonetheless, a commenter from a state
with few large cities suggested that internal inspection devices should only be required for pipelines located in
Class 3 or 4 locations and in environmentally sensitive areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While gas transmission lines operated in conjunction with distribution systems are generally covered under this
rule, RSPA agrees that the rule should provide an exception whenever gas transmission lines operated in conjunction
with distribution systems are located in certain congested urban areas. RSPA believes it is impracticable to design
and construct these particular transmission lines, considering the arguments presented above, to accommodate
passage of smart pigs when there exist physical constraints, not associated with the pipe itself, which are beyond
an operator's control. Furthermore, RSPA understands that underground utility areas in Class 4 locations are typically
overcrowded and unable to accommodate the pipeline configurations needed for the accommodation of smart pigs. So,
in the final rule, &sect;192.150(b)(6) excepts gas transmission lines that are: Operated in conjunction with a gas
distribution system and installed in Class 4 locations. However, gas transmission lines, not operated in conjunction
with a gas distribution system are not excepted because these lines generally pose greater risks, typically transporting
gas at higher pressures.

Gas, Oil and Carbon Dioxide Storage Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twelve commenters recommended that the rule except gas transmission lines which are part of injection/withdrawal
systems at gas storage facilities. Commenters said these gas storage facilities have small diameter piping configured
in a grid-like pattern that would not permit the passage of smart pigs. The TPSSC likewise recommended that storage
facilities be excepted. Similarly, one commenter urged an exception of delivery/withdrawal piping associated
with hazardous liquid storage in breakout tanks, due to the short lengths, short radius bends and other tank farm piping
configurations which are unable to accommodate the passage of smart pigs. The THLPSSC also recommended that tank
farm piping be excepted from compliance with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA agrees that because of piping configuration constraints associated with the storage facilities for gas, hazardous
liquids and carbon dioxide it is generally impracticable for design and construction to accommodate passage of smart
pigs. Therefore, &sect;192.150(b)(3) of the rule excepts piping associated with gas storage facilities, other
than a continuous run of transmission line between a compression station and storage facilities, and &sect;195.120(b)(2)
excepts piping associated with liquid storage facilities. Nonetheless, RSPA will be studying underground storage
issues and, based on that work, may initiate rulemaking to address new safety measures that may be necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Emergencies and Unforeseen Construction Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NPRM proposed to exclude from the rule piping that the Administrator finds, upon petition by an operator, to be
impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of smart pigs. Eighteen commenters stated that
many construction situations are under tight contractual or other time constraints that do not allow sufficient
time to obtain a finding by the Administrator. For example, an operator may have to make immediate adjustments in the
field because of the discovery of obstructions or other unforeseen problems. Thus, some commenters reasoned that
while the Administrator would have at least 90 days to decide whether to grant a petition, most pipeline construction
projects would not allow delays of a few days. A few commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators should be permitted to accept the ``burden of proof'' when encountering an impracticability during construction
and so inform RSPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the TPSSC recommended that the test for impracticability be left up to the operator instead of petitioning
the Administrator for a finding. The Committee suggested the wording ``and any other piping that the operator determines
and documents would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal
inspection device'' be substituted for ``the Administrator finds'' in the exception of &sect;192.150(b) from the
NPRM. Also, the TPSSC recommended that ``emergency repairs'' be added to the list of exceptions contained in &sect;192.150(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA acknowledges that emergencies, construction time constraints, and unforeseen pipeline construction problems
would not allow operators the time to petition for a finding of impracticability and wait for RSPA's response. Therefore,
RSPA has added &sect;&sect;192.150(c) and 195.120(c) which permit an operator discovering an emergency, construction
time constraint or other unforeseeable construction problem to make a provisional determination of impracticability.
In such instances the operator must document the circumstances resulting in its impracticability determination.
Within 30 days after discovering an emergency or a construction problem, the operator must petition under the new
&sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval'' for a finding by the Administrator that design and construction
to accommodate passage of internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, the operator
must modify the line section to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices, within 1 year after the
date of the notice of denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Petitions for Finding or Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NPRM proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval'' be added to part 190 of this Chapter. Except as discussed above,
commenters did not oppose the establishment of a procedure to allow an operator to petition the Administrator for
an administrative ruling on any rule under parts 192, 193, and 195 in which the Administrator is authorized to make
a finding or approval. Heretofore, a similar procedure in part 193 (&sect;193.2015) applied only to petitions relating
to LNG facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rule, the &sect;190.9 has been revised to require operators of intrastate pipelines located in states, participating
under section 5 of the NGPSA or section 205 of the HLPSA to direct their petitions to the state pipeline safety agency.
The participating state agency will then make a recommendation to the Administrator as to the disposition of the petition.

Restraining Elements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Nine commenters objected to the proposed requirement to add restraining devices to all fittings providing branch
line connections. Restraining elements are added when the outlet to the branch line could impede the passage of the
smart pig. Many commenters argued that the addition of restraining elements to these fittings may inhibit cleaning
of the branch lines by spheres or cleaning pigs. Other commenters pointed out that the use of restraining elements
in the main line is unnecessary whenever the branch line has a significantly smaller diameter than the main line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA agrees that the rule should not require restraining elements where they are unnecessary or make impracticable
other functions that are an essential and routine part of pipeline operations and maintenance. So, the rule does not
include a requirement for installing restraining elements, but leaves their installation to the discretion of the
operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Offshore Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Eleven commenters recommended that the rule except offshore pipelines. Several commenters based their recommendations
on the fact that offshore pipeline networks are tied-in by ``hot-tapped'' or tee connections and these tie-ins are
without restraining elements. This type of construction permits cleaning pigs or spheres, required for removal
of materials (such as liquids from gas lines and wax from oil lines) that impede normal flow, to pass into laterals of
ever increasing diameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The system design is contingent on the passage of these cleaning devices through the various laterals for final tie-in
to the liquid trunk (main) lines and to the gas transmission lines. Then, these larger diameter lines transport the
cleaning pigs to onshore facilities, for eventual retrieval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator of offshore gas systems said that because of the many subsea tie-ins to pipelines of larger diameter, smart
pigs will require some type of elaborate receiving device or physically disconnecting/lifting the pipeline; either
of which would be very expensive. Other commenters advised that smart pigs cannot be launched or received subsea.
An offshore operator said that new offshore platforms typically connect new platforms to an existing subsea network.
Connections to an existing subsea pipeline are ``hot-tapped'' or are extensions to existing laterals. This operator
summed up his recommendations by saying that it is impractical to design for the passage of smart pigs through these
connections and it is certainly impractical to install subsea traps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also stated that because of space limitations on the offshore platforms, the pipelines (risers) which
have been routed up onto the platforms have been designed and constructed with short radius bends and other fittings
that are only adequate for the launching of cleaning pigs or spheres. These commenters argue that the construction
of the risers with long-sweeping bends on the sea floor and on the platform, and the installation of the longer launchers
and receivers required to accommodate smart pigs, would be impracticable. For many of the same reasons, both the TPSSC
and the THLPSSC recommended that offshore pipelines be excepted from the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA acknowledges that many subsea pipelines have been designed and constructed without restraining bars on branch
line connections, because they would prohibit the passage of cleaning pigs and spheres. This design allows cleaning
pigs and spheres to pass through the network of subsea laterals and ultimately into larger transmission or trunk (main)
lines that transport gas or liquids to shore facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also apparent to RSPA, that designers of offshore platforms seldom anticipated the space required to accommodate
facilities necessary for the operation of smart pigs. Moreover, RSPA accepts that smart pigs cannot be launched or
received subsea. However, RSPA does not agree with the commenters or the two advisory committees that all gas and liquid
offshore pipelines should be fully excepted from this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For pipelines subject to part 195, the current &sect;195.120 requires that each component of a main line system, other
than manifolds, that change direction within the pipeline system must have a radius of turn that readily allows the
passage of pipeline scrapers, spheres, and internal inspection equipment. This requirement for main line components
to readily allow the passage of smart pigs through changes of direction has been in effect since 1970, when offshore
liquid lines became subject to part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 192 has applied to offshore gas lines since 1971. In accordance with the requirements of section 108(b) of the
Reauthorization Act, RSPA sees the need for certain new and replacement offshore gas transmission lines and risers
from these lines to be designed and constructed to allow passage of smart pigs.

Accordingly, in &sect;&sect;192.150(b)(7) and 195.120(b)(6), while the rule has not excepted all offshore lines
and related facilities, it has excepted offshore lines which are not gas transmission lines or liquid main lines 10
inches or greater in nominal diameter that transport these commodities to onshore facilities. RSPA limited the accommodation
of smart pigs to these larger gas transmission and liquid main lines because we find, for the reasons expressed by the
commenters, that the unique design and construction of the excepted offshore pipeline systems makes them generally
impracticable for the passage of smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the rulemaking mandated by the PLSA of 1992 discussed under the heading_Future Rulemaking Involving Smart Pigs_is
issued, RSPA may prescribe the circumstances for inspection with smart pigs. Such circumstances, if included in
any final rule, may require the need for offshore platforms that contain risers, to also accommodate launchers and
(where appropriate) receivers for the passage of smart pigs.

Above Ground Pipelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Three commenters recommended that RSPA except above ground pipelines because operators can inspect these pipelines
visually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA finds that regardless of whether an operator can visually inspect a line above ground is irrelevant to the practicability
of design and construction of pipelines to accommodate passage of smart pigs. Furthermore, smart pigs are capable
of detecting internal defects that cannot be discovered by a visual inspection of the outside surface of a pipeline.
Moreover, above ground pipelines are required to be externally coated and coating materials usually preclude visual
inspection of the outside surface. So, this recommendation was not adopted.

Clarification of the Term ``Replacement''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Thirteen commenters recommended that the terms ``replacement transmission line'' and ``replacement pipeline''
be clarified to indicate the portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an existing line that must be modified to accommodate smart pigs when replacements are made for other reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A gas pipeline operator recommended that the meaning of the term ``replacement transmission line'' be limited to
the pipe and components such as valves, bends, and fittings which are added to or replaced in an existing transmission
line. Another gas pipeline operator expressed support for regulations stating that replacement pipeline facilities
could not be constructed which would further restrict the passage of a smart pig. RSPA cannot accept the first commenter's
recommendations because if ``replacement'' is limited to a replaced valve, a joint of pipe, or other component, then
pipelines with restrictive components, such as elbows and tight radius field bends (which when properly maintained
never need replacement) would never be piggable. Also RSPA cannot accept the second commenter's position because
it appears to mean that the operator need only to make the replacement no more restrictive than it was prior to it being
replaced. The clear intent of the congressional mandate is to improve an existing pipeline's piggability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pipeline operator and a pipeline related association, recommended that the word ``pipeline'' be replaced with
``line section'' defined in &sect;195.2. A gas pipeline association urged that ``replacement transmission line''
be changed to ``replacement transmission section'' to clearly indicate that only the portion of line replaced must
accommodate the passage of smart pigs. Another pipeline related association interpreted ``replacement'' to mean
either: (1) Replacement of the entire line, or (2) replacement of the line segment between two logical points (e.g.
compressor stations). A gas pipeline operator also believed the term ``segment'' is appropriate because it is frequently
used in part 192 and it recognizes that pipelines are segmented for different regulatory purposes. A gas transmission
operator felt that the definition of ``replacement line'' should exempt the replacement of partial segments of existing
gas pipelines within a valve section that are replaced because of class change or regular maintenance work because
of construction restraints. A gas distribution operator stated that if the proposal was intended to apply to the replaced
or relocated section only, then that limitation should be in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Congressional mandate requires the gradual elimination of restrictions in existing gas transmission lines
and existing hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide lines in a manner that will eventually make the lines piggable. Operators
are only required to remove the restrictions when replacements are made on the pipeline. On those occasions, the economic
burden of the upgrading is reduced because crews and equipment will be on the site and that portion of the pipeline will
need to be out of service. Six of the commenters appear to have considered the favorable economics when they recommended
that the upgrading for piggability cover the ``line segment'' or ``line section''. While ``line segment'' is frequently
used in the gas regulations it is not defined, although it's used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similarly to ``line section'' (one commenter suggested it was the distance between two logical points e.g. compressor
stations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in consideration of the comments ``line section'' is used in place of the term ``replacement transmission
line'' in part 192, and ``line section'' is used in place of the term ``replacement pipeline'' in part 195, as those
terms are used in the NPRM. ``Line section,'' as added to part 192 is similar to ``line section'' as it is defined in &sect;195.2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part 195, ``line section'' is currently defined in &sect;195.2 to mean a continuous run of pipe between adjacent
pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and terminal or breakout tanks, between a pressure pump station
and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves. Now, in part 192 ``line section'' is defined in &sect;192.3 to
mean a continuous run of transmission line between adjacent compressor stations, between a compressor station and
storage facilities, between a compressor station and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;&sect;192.150(a) and 195.120(a) have been revised to clarify that when a replacement is made
of line pipe, line valve, line fitting, or other line component in an existing pipeline, covered by this rule, the complete
line section must be made to accommodate smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, RSPA has modified the final rule in response to the comment from the gas transmission operator that felt replacements
of certain partial segments within an existing valve section that are replaced because of MAOP class change or regular
maintenance work requirements, should be excepted because of construction constraints. Although, the construction
restraints were not specified, RSPA has addressed construction type problems with the procedure set out in &sect;&sect;192.150(c)
and 195.120(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Launchers and Receivers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Several commenters agreed with statements in the NPRM that installation of pig traps should not be required by this
rulemaking, but should be left to the discretion of pipeline operators. Also, a commenter agreed with the statement
in the NPRM that operators should determine where pig traps are to be permanently located based on individual operating
circumstances. A gas pipeline operator said that in a practical sense, it would be more cost effective to add launchers
and receivers at the time of construction rather than after the transmission line is in service (which could again
require the line to be taken out of service). The National Transportation Safety Board urged RSPA to revise its proposal
so that facilities for entering and removing smart pigs are required on all pipelines capable of being traversed by
such equipment. However, RSPA believes that revising the NPRM for this purpose would delay the regulatory effect
of this rulemaking and the requirement may be included in a future rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, as in the NPRM, RSPA has not included requirements for launchers or receivers. However, when the
rulemaking mandated by the PLSA of 1992 is issued, RSPA may prescribe the circumstances for inspection with smart
pigs. Such circumstances, if included in any final rule, may require facilities for launching or receiving smart
pigs. In the meantime, RSPA urges pipeline operators to consider the economic advantages of voluntarily installing
facilities, at the time of construction or replacement of pipelines, for launching and receiving smart pigs.

Exemption of Gathering Lines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Several commenters urged clarification of the exception for gas gathering lines in the proposed &sect;192.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the comments, RSPA agrees that clarification is needed. Therefore, the exception, of the new &sect;192.150,
has been retained and the current exception, as provided in &sect;192.1, has been referenced in the revised &sect;192.9.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in &sect;&sect;192.150(b)(7) and 195.120(b)(6), RSPA has excepted offshore pipelines other than gas
transmission or liquid main lines, 10 inches or larger, that transport gas or liquids to onshore facilities. Liquid
gathering lines, which are defined in &sect;195.2, are included in this exception.

Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Nineteen commenters discussed the economic impact and the majority found fault with RSPA's assessment that the rule

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would add minimally to the average expense of pipeline design and construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of information presented by the commenters, RSPA has excepted various categories of pipelines from the
final rule. These exceptions are: Piping associated with storage facilities, other than gas transmission lines;
piping sizes for which a smart pig is not commercially available; gas transmission lines, operated in conjunction
with a distribution system, which are installed in Class 4 locations; and offshore pipelines other than certain gas
transmission and liquid main lines. Additionally, operators are permitted to make a provisional determination
of impracticability in instances of emergencies, construction time constraints or other unforeseeable construction
problems that require immediate action. Other less urgent problems can be handled through the newly established
procedure in &sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, these exceptions together with others carried forward from the NPRM substantially reduce the cost
of compliance with the rule. RSPA finds that the compliance costs will be minimal. A Regulatory Evaluation has been
prepared and is available in the Docket.

Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore,
is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the regulatory
policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA believes that the rule will add minimally to the average expense of pipeline design and construction. The information
RSPA has collected for the study under section 304 of the Reauthorization Act shows that about 90 percent of hazardous
liquid pipelines and 60 percent of gas transmission lines have been constructed to accommodate the passage of smart
pigs. This information confirms RSPA's field experience that most operators are now constructing new and replacement
gas transmission lines and hazardous liquid pipelines to accommodate smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA lacks detailed information about carbon dioxide pipelines which recently became subject to part 195. However,
there are only about 10 such pipeline systems and we understand that they are not expected to grow in mileage or to require
a significant amount of replacement in the near term. Thus, those pipelines should not be greatly affected by the revision
of &sect;195.120.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the Federal Government
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), RSPA has determined that this final rule
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are very few small entities that operate pipelines affected by this rulemaking. To the extent that any small
entity is affected, the regulatory evaluation accompanying this rule shows that the costs are minimal. Based on these
facts, I certify that under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this final regulation does not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each new pipeline and each line section of a pipeline
where the line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component is replaced; must be designed and constructed to accommodate
the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

(7) Other piping that the Administrator under &sect;190.9 of this chapter, finds in a particular case would be impracticable
to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints and other unforeseen construction problems
need not construct a new or replacement segment of a pipeline to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator
determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within
30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under &sect;190.9 of
this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection
devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial,
the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board is conducting research during fiscal year 1994
on whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas and their effect on persons
with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. Depending on the results of this research, the Access Board may
conduct additional research during fiscal year 1995 to refine the scoping provisions and technical specifications
for detectable warnings at these locations. Because of the issues that have been raised about the use of detectable
warnings at curb ramps and curbless entranceways to retail stores and other places of public accommodation, the Access
Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation are suspending temporarily until July 26,
1996 the requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools in
the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) so that the agencies can consider the results
of the research and determine whether any changes in the requirements are warranted.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 9, 1993, the Access Board published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing that it planned to conduct research during fiscal year 1994 on whether detectable warnings are needed
at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas and their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians.

 58 FR 37058. On the same day, the Access Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation (hereinafter
referred to as ``the agencies'') published a joint notice of the proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to suspend temporarily the requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting
pools in the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) pending the research. 58 FR 37052.
In issuing the NPRM, the agencies noted that blind persons and their organizations had taken differing positions
regarding whether detectable warnings are needed at these locations; that persons with mobility impairments had
expressed concern that installing detectable warnings on the entire length of curb ramps would adversely affect
their ability to safely negotiate the sloped surfaces; and that a national association of retail stores had asserted
that installing detectable warnings on curb ramps and curbless entranceways to the stores would pose a tripping hazard
for their customers. The agencies stated in the NPRM that because of these potential safety issues they believed that
it would be in the public interest to suspend temporarily the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at the locations
noted above until the research provides additional information to address the issues.

Detectable warnings are a pattern of closely spaced, small truncated domes that are built in or applied to a walking
surface to alert persons who are blind or who have low vision of hazards on a circulation path. 36 CFR Part 1191, Appendix
A, Section 4.29.2. Research has shown that the truncated dome pattern is highly detectable both by cane and under foot.
The truncated dome pattern has been used as a detectable warning along transit platform edges for over five years by
the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in California and by the Metro-Dade Transit Agency in Florida. The truncated
dome pattern has also been used in Great Britain, Japan, and other countries as a detectable warning.

Over 150 comments were received on the July 9, 1993 NPRM. Another 110 comments concerning detectable warnings were
received in response to a NPRM published by the Access Board in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 21, 1992 which proposed to reserve detectable warnings provisions for curb ramps installed in the public
right-of-way by State and local governments. 58 FR 60612. The comments received in response to both the July 9, 1993
NPRM and the December 21, 1992 NPRM have been considered in this rulemaking. The comments came from blind persons and
their organizations (132 comments); State and local government agencies (54 comments); manufacturers of detectable
warnings (14 comments); professional and trade associations (11 comments); businesses (4 comments); organizations
representing persons with mobility impairments (4 comments); mobility specialists (13 comments); and other individuals
(17 comments) and entities (14 comments). About 25 persons submitted comments in response to both NPRM's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments centered around three issues: whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and other locations;
their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians; and their durability, maintainability,
and cost. The comments are further discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Federation of the Blind (NFB), ten NFB chapters, and 31 blind individuals submitted comments supporting
the proposed suspension of the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas,
and reflecting pools. NFB further recommended that detectable warnings be eliminated eventually from ADAAG, including
at transit platform edges. NFB asserted that blind persons are responsible for using effective travel methods (i.e.,
cane or guide dog) and that public policy should be based on an ``individual responsibility'' standard. NFB pointed
out that blind persons move about safely every day without detectable warnings; and stated that fears of blind persons
falling or being injured are based on emotional responses and not factual information. NFB claimed that there are
sufficient cues already available in the environment to alert blind persons of hazards on a circulation path and that
if only some hazards are marked by detectable warnings, the inconsistency is likely to defeat their intended purpose
and could create a threat rather than an aid to safe mobility for blind persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council of the Blind (ACB), 18 ACB chapters, the Council of Citizens with Low Vision International and
two of its chapters, the Guide Dog Users of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, the National Alliance of Blind Students,
the American Foundation for the Blind, the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually
Impaired, 15 other State and local organizations representing persons who are blind or who have vision impairments,
49 blind individuals, and eight mobility specialists submitted comments opposing the suspension. These commenters
recounted incidents of blind persons approaching curb ramps and stepping into the street without stopping; walking
into reflecting pools; and falling from transit platforms. News articles were submitted reporting the deaths of
three blind persons who fell from subway platforms in Boston and New York and from a commuter rail platform in Maryland
during 1993.

 Another news article reported an incident of a blind person who was severely injured from falling in front of an oncoming
train in Baltimore in December 1992.

Cues Blind Travelers Use to Detect Streets, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Washington, DC: American Council of the Blind (1993). Eight cities were included in the research project. In each
city, ten blind persons who use canes to travel approached ten unfamiliar intersections with curb ramps without detectable
warnings. They were asked to stop when they believed their next step would be into the street and to report the cues which
they used to determine where to stop. Of the 80 blind persons who participated in the research project, 75% were considered
good-to-excellent travellers by self-report and through assessment by orientation and mobility specialists;
and two-thirds reported travelling independently a minimum of five times a week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 800 street approaches, the participants walked down the center of the curb ramps in 557 instances and stopped
before the street in 360 cases (65%). Of the 22 cues reportedly used to detect the street, the two most frequently mentioned
cues were the downslope of the ramp and the presence of traffic on the street perpendicular to the participant's line
of travel. Other cues frequently mentioned were the upslope or texture change at the street, the end of the building
line or shoreline, and the presence of traffic on the street parallel to the participant's line of travel. The participants

In the 197 instances (35%) where the participants walked down the curb ramp and did not stop before the street: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There was traffic on the street perpendicular to the participant's line of travel in 116 cases (59%). The traffic
was moving in 75 cases and idling in 41 cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The participants took two or more steps into the street in 151 cases (76%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the participants reported the presence of the traffic on the street perpendicular to their line of travel
and the upslope or texture change at the street as frequently used cues to detect the street, the research data indicate
that these cues are not sufficient to consistently and dependably identify the street.

The research project also analyzed participant variables such as frequency of travel, travel proficiency, cane

The research data also suggest that there is a strong relationship between the rate of change in slope between the walkway

The ten most difficult streets to detect (i.e., where most participants stepped into the street without stopping)
had a ramp with a slope of 4
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; or less and at least one of the following characteristics: a curb ramp parallel to the participant's line of travel;
a very quiet street or busy street with surges of traffic and gaps in traffic cues; no building line or a building line
that was different from others on the route; and little or no texture change or upslope at the street or a change which
was considered gradual. At one blended curb, all ten participants stepped into the street without stopping and five
of them crossed the entire street without detecting it despite an abrupt end to the shore line, a surface texture change,
and a slight lip where the street pavement overlapped the sidewalk.

[F]uture research could more precisely measure the curb ramps included in this project, and analyze performance
with relationship to these more accurate measurements. It may be possible that ramps which have 1:12 slopes facilitate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high detection rates, while ramps of lesser slopes (e.g., 1:15) may be clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with low detection rates. If ramps of 1:12 facilitate high street detection rates, then it is possible
that the [ADAAG] requirement for detectable warnings on curb ramps could be limited, e.g., to ramps having slopes
less than 1:12. The requirement that detectable warnings extend over the entire surface of curb ramps is not supported
by empirical evidence that such an extensive tactile cue is necessary to alert blind travellers to the end of a curb
ramp and the beginning of a street. It is possible that a lesser amount of warning (24
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; or 36
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;) may be sufficient. If so, the optimal placement of the warning still remains to be determined. Suggested
locations are (1) on the lower end of the ramp, immediately adjoining the street; (2) on the upper end of the ramp; and
(3) around the sides and at the top of the ramp. Dimensions and location of detectable warnings need further empirical
research.

Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association (EPVA) initially supported the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings
and explained that it had changed its position after reviewing the data from the earlier Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
and Metro-Dade Transit Agency studies. The BART study conducted tests on level platform surfaces with 24 persons
with mobility impairments, including four manual wheelchair users. Five participants (21%) responded that the
detectable warnings would be helpful; eight (33%) responded that they were ``not affected''; seven (29%) responded
that they would be ``insignificantly affected''; four (17%) responded that they would be ``moderately impaired'';
and none responded that they would be ``seriously impaired.'' Three of the manual wheelchair users responded that
they would be ``insignificantly affected'' and the other one responded that he or she would be ``moderately impaired.''
Peck, A.F. and Bentzen, B.L., Tactile Warnings to Promote Safety in the Vicinity of Transit Platform Edges, Cambridge,
MA: Transportation Systems Center (1987). The Metro-Dade Transit Agency conducted tests with seven wheelchair
users on level platform surfaces. Five of the participants responded that they were ``not affected'' or ``insignificantly
affected.'' The other two had difficulty with the detectable warnings but their specific responses are not reported
in the study. Mitchell, M., Pathfinder Tactile Tile Demonstration Test Project, Miami, FL: Metro-Dade Transit Agency
(1988). Carsonite International, the manufacturer of the detectable warning materials used in the BART and Metro-Dade
Transit Agency systems, submitted a letter from BART stating that in over five years experience with detectable warnings
on its rail system, no problems have been observed with wheelchair users entering or exiting the trains.

The International Mass Retail Association, the National Grocers Association, the Food Marketing Association,
the Building Owners and Managers Association International, a regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial real estate association, 37 State and local government agencies, and four businesses expressed concern
that detectable warnings would pose a tripping hazard to other pedestrians and supported the suspension. Commenters
who opposed the suspension stated that concerns about the safety of others are speculative and unsubstantiated.
Several manufacturers commented that there have been no reported incidents of trips or falls attributable to their

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. A bank and a retail store chain stated that they had installed detectable warnings on curb ramps at their
sites and had received complaints from wheelchair users and elderly customers. Only one commenter, a local school
district, reported that an adult and some students had tripped while running over a curb ramp with detectable warnings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Transit Administration and Project ACTION of the National Easter Seal Society have recently sponsored
a research project on detectable warnings which among other things tested detectable warnings on curb ramps for safety
and negotiability by persons with mobility impairments. Bentzen, B.L., Nolin, T.L., Easton, R.D., and Desmarais,
L., Detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Warning Surfaces: Detectability by Individuals with Visual Impairments, and Safety and Negotiability for Individuals
with Physical Impairments, Cambridge, MA: Transportation Systems Center (1993). The study tested a variety of detectable
warning materials with 40 persons having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a wide range of physical disabilities. The participants included 15 persons who use mobility aids with wheels (power
and manual wheelchairs, and three- and four-wheeled scooters); 18 persons who use mobility aids with tips (canes,
crutches and walkers); and seven persons who do not use any mobility aid. The participants travelled up and down ramps
that were six feet long and four feet wide with a 1:12 slope, the maximum slope permitted by ADAAG for new construction.
Detectable warnings were installed on the entire six foot length of the ramps. For comparison, participants also
travelled up and down a brushed concrete ramp of the same dimensions. Subjective and objective measurements were
collected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 40 participants, the objective data showed that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;14 participants (35%) exhibited no difficulty negotiating the ramp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;19 participants (47.5%) exhibited few difficulties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;7 participants (17.5%) exhibited numerous difficulties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latter group included four persons who used manual wheelchairs; two persons who used walkers with wheels (rollators);
and one person who wore leg braces and used a quad cane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physical therapist who observed the participants reported that persons using no mobility aids performed consistently
well on all the ramps with detectable warnings and that even those with protheses or braces showed good negotiability.
Persons using power wheelchairs, and three- and four-wheeled scooters demonstrated few, if any difficulties, on
any of the ramps with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detectable warnings. However, four of the five manual wheelchair users exhibited numerous difficulties negotiating
the ramps with detectable warnings, including exerting additional effort to go up the ramps, and the small, narrow
front wheels getting caught in the groves between the domes. Participants using canes, crutches, or walkers were
observed to have the most difficulties on the ramps with detectable warnings. Mobility aids with small tips (canes
or walkers) appeared to get caught between the domes or lay on an angle between the grove and the dome, causing the participant
to feel less stable. Participants who used crutches with larger tips appeared more safe and generally negotiated
the ramps with detectable warnings better than those who used canes or walkers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research project report recommended that ``given even the moderately increased level of difficulty and decrease
in safety which detectable warnings on slopes pose for persons with physical disabilities, it is desirable to limit
the width of detectable warnings to no more than that required to provide an effective warning for persons with visual
impairments.'' The report suggested that a standard width of 24, 30 or 36 inches be established for detectable warning
surfaces and indicated that such widths would provide an effective stopping distance for 90 to 95% of blind persons
and persons with low vision.

Durability, Maintainability, and Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters who supported suspending the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous
vehicular areas, and reflecting pools also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concern about the durability and maintainability of detectable warning materials, especially under
certain climatic conditions (e.g., snow and ice, and the need for snow and ice removal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that a member of the ANSI A117 Committee recently visited the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system
and observed a 50 to 60% ``failure rate'' with the corners of the detectable warning titles ``turning up and creating
tripping hazards.'' The commenter also cited a magazine article on the use of detectable warnings in Japan as evidence
that they are prone to breakage and deterioration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of various detectable warning materials responded with information about their products. Carsonite
International, the manufacturer of the detectable warning materials used in the BART system, stated that in its ten
years of experience, it is rare that the product or the adhesive fails. Where loosening or delamination has occurred,
it was due to a failure to properly prepare the substrate. Carsonite International also submitted a letter from BART
stating that annual costs for maintaining the detectable warnings at its 34 stations are $10,800 for materials and
8,160 hours of labor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another detectable warning manufacturer stated that its product has been in use for the past two winters in the Boston
area and that there have been no notable difficulties with snow and ice removal. The commenter also mentioned sites
in Ontario, Canada where detectable warnings have been installed and have performed well under tough winter conditions.
Other commenters who opposed the suspension noted that there were snow and ice removal techniques that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be used with detectable warnings without adversely affecting the efficiency of the overall snow removal operation
such as hot-air blowers, stiff brooms, and de-icing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters who supported the suspension objected to the cost of detectable warnings but did not provide any specific
data. There are currently a variety of detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning products on the market, including ceramic, hard composite, and resilient tiles; cast pavers; pre-cast concrete
and concrete stamping systems; stamped metal; rubber mats; and resilient coatings. The costs of these products range
from three to twenty dollars per square foot. One commenter mentioned that a university had installed detectable
warnings on 25 to 30 new curb ramps on its campus at an added cost of $5,000 for the entire project.

Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) submitted comments on the July 9, 1993 NPRM stating that
based on a comparison of trackbed falling accidents for the WMATA and BART systems, it believed that the granite edges
on its platforms are superior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
truncated domes. Based on this analysis, WMATA requested that the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings be
changed from truncated domes to granite edges. The truncated dome pattern was adopted in ADAAG because research has
shown that it is highly detectable both by cane and underfoot. WMATA did not submit any information showing that its
granite edge is equally detectable both by cane and underfoot. As WMATA noted in its comments, the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of trackbed falling accidents involving blind persons and persons with low vision are relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small in comparison to the millions of passenger miles traveled annually on our nation's rail systems to do any statistically
meaningful analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WMATA also recommended that research be conducted on the safety of the truncated dome pattern for other passengers
and that the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings in key stations and in newly constructed and altered rail
stations be suspended indefinitely. The truncated dome pattern has been used as a detectable warning on the platform
edges of all rail stations in the BART and Metro-Dade Transit Agency systems for over five years and no safety problems
have been reported by persons with mobility impairments or other passengers. The Access Board is conducting additional
research because questions have been raised whether experience from the rail station environment is transferable
to sloped curb ramps and curbless entranceways to retail stores. Additional research on the use of the truncated dome
pattern in rail stations is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
(SEPTA) referenced a NPRM published by the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Transportation on November 17, 1992 (57 FR 54210) which proposed to extend the deadline for retrofitting key rail
stations with detectable warnings until January 26, 1995. MTA and SEPTA stated that they did not believe that the proposed
extension provided sufficient time for them to complete testing products and to purchase and install the detectable
warnings. MTA and SEPTA requested that the deadline for retrofitting key rail stations with detectable warnings
be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delayed until the Access Board's research on use of detectable warnings on curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas
is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Transportation published a final rule on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63092) extending the deadline
for retrofitting key rail stations with detectable warnings until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 26, 1994. In the final rule, the Department of Transportation stated that ``[t]he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop-offs at the edges of rail station platforms create a clear, documented, and unacceptable hazard to persons with
visual impairments'' and that detectable warnings as specified in ADAAG will mitigate this hazard. The Department
of Transportation noted that many rail systems have been working with detectable warning manufacturers to address
concerns about durability and maintainability and that the extension provided for in the final rule was adequate
to permit an aggressive effort by rail systems to address concerns about installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Public Transit Association (APTA) submitted a comment stating that, if as a result of the additional
research conducted by the Access Board on the use of detectable warnings at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas,
the technical specifications for detectable warnings should be changed, rail systems could be placed in a position
of installing material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could be found to be unsafe in other applications, and having to replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material later. If the research shows that detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas,
it is possible that some refinements may be made to the scoping provisions and technical specification for detectable
warnings (e.g., the location and width of detectable warnings for curb ramps; the types of hazardous vehicular areas
where detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warnings will be required). However, substantial change to the basic pattern of raised truncated domes is not anticipated.
The Department of Transportation has indicated in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule extending the deadline for retrofitting key rail stations with detectable warnings that if the technical
specifications for detectable warnings change in the future, the grandfathering provision in its regulations (49
CFR 37.9) could apply in appropriate situations to avoid making rail systems reinstall detectable warnings meeting
the revised specifications.

Final Common Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking raises some difficult issues. It involves making decisions about the safety needs of blind persons
and persons with low vision and considering their needs in light of the concerns expressed by persons with mobility
impairments and other commenters. The task is all the more complicated by the fact that blind persons and their organizations
have taken differing positions on the matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully reviewing the comments received on the July 9, 1993 and December 21, 1992 NPRM's and the reports of
the two recent research projects discussed above, the agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that it is in the public interest to suspend temporarily the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at
curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional research is conducted on the need for detectable warnings at these locations and their effect on persons
with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The July 9, 1993 NPRM proposed that the suspension remain in effect until January 26, 1995. This date was first proposed
by the Access Board in November 1992. At the time, the Access Board envisioned that the additional research would be
completed in fiscal year 1994 and that the agencies would have an opportunity to review the results of the research
and, if necessary, initiate further rulemaking on detectable warnings before January 26, 1995. In subsequent planning
for the research project, the Access Board has divided the project into two phases. The first phase, which is scheduled
for completion in fiscal year 1994, will focus on whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous
vehicular areas and their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. Depending on the results
of the first phase, an optional second phase may be conducted during fiscal year 1995 to refine the scoping provisions
and technical specifications for detectable warnings at these locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the second phase of the research project is conducted, the agencies will conduct further rulemaking to amend the
scoping provisions and technical specifications based upon the recommendations of the research project. Allowing
nine months for the rulemaking process from the end of fiscal year 1995, the joint final rule provides for the suspension
to remain in effect until July 26, 1996. Of course, depending on the results of the first phase of the research project,
the agencies could decide to conduct further rulemaking earlier. The July 26, 1996 date is the outside period by which
the agencies expect to complete all rulemaking on this matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that the agencies provide guidance in this rulemaking on whether entities may be required
to retrofit existing curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflecting pools with detectable warnings at a future date under the program accessibility requirements for State
and local governments (28 CFR 35.150) and the readily achievable barrier removal requirements for public accommodations
(28 CFR 36.304). At this time, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premature to provide such guidance. The agencies will further address these questions after the research project
is completed and further rulemaking on the matter is conducted.

Regulatory Analyses and Notices

The agencies have independently determined that this final rule is not a significant

regulatory action and that a regulatory assessment is not required under Executive Order 12866. It is a significant
rule under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures since it amends the agency's ADA
regulations, which are a significant rule. The Department of Transportation expects the economic impacts to be minimal
and has not prepared a full regulatory evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies hereby independently certify that this proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to provide for the issuance of temporary flight
restrictions on certain operations when accurate altitude information is not available. The rule is warranted because
barometric pressure higher than 31.00 inches of mercury (inHg) (1049.8 millibars) exceeds the capability of standard
aircraft pressure altimeters and prevents the display of accurate altitude information. The rule provides restrictions
on certain flight operations during periods of abnormal atmospheric pressure conditions and is necessary to promote
flight safety during certain operations for which accurate altitude information is critical.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For several days in January 1989, weather observers in various locations in the State of Alaska recorded record-breaking
barometric pressure higher than 31.00 inHg (1049.8 millibars). These extremely high barometric pressures exceeded
the capability of standard aircraft pressure altimeters and prevented the display of accurate altitude information
on aircraft pressure altimeters. This condition occasionally extends to northern portions of the contiguous United
States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft altimeters indicate altitude based on a reading of the air pressure surrounding the aircraft. These altimeters
incorporate an adjustment for environmental barometric pressure that permits pilots manually to set the correct
pressure reading in the instrument. If the pressure setting is incorrect, the altitude readout also will be incorrect.
Because barometric readings of 31.00 inHg, or higher, seldom occur, standard altimeters do not permit barometric
pressures to be set above that level and are not calibrated to indicate accurate aircraft altitude when the surface
pressure exceeds 31.00 inHg. As a result, many altimeters cannot be set to display accurate altitude readouts to pilots
in conditions such as those that were experienced during the high pressure conditions in Alaska.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
It is possible to estimate the error in altitude for pressures above 31.00 inHg by adding 100 feet in aircraft altitude
for each .10 inHg. However, significant recurring training would be required to ensure all pilots correctly apply
the appropriate correction during the appropriate phase of flight. If two pilots flying aircraft in the same vicinity
are not applying the same correction, a highly dangerous situation is created when they are at the same altitude although
they believe they are at different altitudes relative to each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accurate altitude information is essential for normal flight operations and critical to certain phases of flight.
Without an accurate altitude reading, a pilot cannot safely execute an instrument approach in instrument weather
conditions unless certain restrictions are followed.

Proposed Rulemaking and Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 12, 1992, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) inviting all persons to submit written
comments on the proposed amendment to &sect;91.92 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (57 FR 8830). The FAA
received comments to the NPRM from the Air Traffic Control Association, the Air Transport Association (ATA), the
Airline Pilots Association, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), and the Canadian Airline Pilots Association (CALPA).
All five commenters responded favorably to the amendment; however, the ATA, KLM, and CALPA had additional comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA requested, for purposes of clarification, that the final rule state that the restrictions are to be applied in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
region when the barometric pressure exceeds 31.00 inHg. The FAA disagrees that the suggested additional language
is needed. The application of this rule is not intended to be limited to any geographical area, and discussion of regions
may lead to confusion concerning the rule's applicability. The final rule clearly states the rule is applicable to
any route of flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) suggested that a note addressing the Outer Marker (OM) crossing altitude as published
on the applicable instrument approach procedure be added either to the rule or as part of the NOTAM implementing the
rule. It argued that very low temperatures require an increase of the published (standard atmosphere) crossing altitude,
while extremely high barometric pressures would call for a decrease in the crossing altitude and that, in most cases,
both effects would cancel out each other. KLM stated, however, that if flight crewmembers only increased the crossing
altitude for temperature, as is the normal procedure, an incorrect crossing altitude would be computed that would
not provide an accurate check for intercepting the instrument landing system (ILS) glidepath.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with KLM that extremely cold temperatures and high barometric pressures, which usually accompany
one another, normally cancel out the effects of each other in altitude computations. The FAA does not believe, however,
that a note concerning this phenomenon is appropriate for the FAR. An appropriate note might be included in the Airman's
Information Manual (AIM). CALPA also commented that the NPRM contained no reference to corrections for extremely
cold air temperatures. It stated that Canadian airline procedure compensates for lower than normal ambient temperatures.
CALPA suggested adding to the final rule instrument approach procedures that contain tabulations allowing the pilot
to make corrections when very cold temperatures are experienced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is aware of the Canadian procedures on altimetry and recently completed a study entitled ``Extreme Cold Weather
Altimetry.'' At this time, however, the FAA has not developed any procedures as a result of the study. The FAA will amend
the rule should procedures formulated from this study dictate an amendment.

Temporary Restrictions on Flight Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the above discussion, the FAA finds that the occurrence of abnormally high barometric pressure conditions
creates an operational situation that requires immediate action to maintain safety of flight in the affected areas.
It is necessary for the FAA to issue temporary restrictions on certain instrument flight rules (IFR) approaches and
visual flight rules (VFR) operations while extreme weather conditions exist.

The specific restrictions authorized by this rule will be issued in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) by each affected FAA
region when any information indicates the barometric pressure will exceed 31.00 inHg. Paragraph 7&hyph;531 of the
FAA Airman's Information Manual contains the procedures that will be put into effect by NOTAM when the pressure is
above 31.00 inHg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These restrictions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. All aircraft: Set the altimeter to 31.00 inHg for en route operations below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). Maintain
this setting until the aircraft is beyond the affected area or until reaching the final approach segment. At the beginning
of the final approach segment, set the altimeter to the current barometric pressure, if possible. If not possible,
leave the altimeter set at 31.00 inHg throughout the approach. Altimeters on departing aircraft or on aircraft on
missed approach will be set to 31.00 inHg before the aircraft reaches any mandatory/crossing altitude, or 1,500 feet
above ground level (AGL), whichever is lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. During preflight, altimeters shall be checked, to the extent possible, for normal operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the aircraft is being operated into or out of airports with the capability of measuring the current barometric
pressure and the aircraft is equipped with an altimeter that has the capability to be set to the current barometric
pressure, no additional restrictions apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For aircraft operating under VFR, there are no additional restrictions; however, extra diligence is essential
in flight planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Airports without the capability for accurate measurement of barometric pressures above 31.00 inHg will report
the barometric pressure as ``in excess of 31.00 inHg.'' Flight operations to and from those airports are restricted
to VFR weather conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. For aircraft operating under IFR and equipped with an altimeter that does not have the capacity to be set at the current
barometric pressure, the following restrictions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. To determine the suitability of takeoff airports, destination airports, and alternate airports, increase ceiling
requirements by 100 feet and visibility requirements by 1/4 mile for each .10 inHg of pressure, or any portion thereof,
over 31.00 inHg. These adjusted values are to be applied in accordance with the requirements of the applicable operating
regulations and operations specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. On approach, 31.00 inHg will remain set on the altimeter. Decision height or minimum descent altitude shall be deemed
to have been reached when the published minimum altitude is displayed on the altimeter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. These restrictions do not apply to authorized Category II and Category III ILS operations, nor do they apply to certificate
holders using approved QFE (absolute altitude) altimetry systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Regional Flight Standards Division manager of the affected area is authorized to approve temporary waivers
to permit emergency resupply or emergency medical services operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOTAM issuing the temporary restrictions will incorporate a reference to the rule.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore,
no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with Department of Transportation policies
and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the anticipated costs and benefits, which are summarized below. For more detailed
economic information, see the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule involves additional costs to aviators through delays in flying to airports experiencing extremely high
barometric pressure. The cost of the rule varies by the number of hours of delay, by the level of activity at the restricted
airports, and by the type of aircraft delayed. Data from the National Weather Service (NWS) was used to estimate the
amount of time airports will experience extreme high pressure. The discounted 10 year cost of this rule due to delays
resulting from the restrictions is estimated to be $3.0 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits of the rule are avoidance of midair collisions during periods of extremely high barometric pressure. These
meteorological conditions increase the risk of midair collision resulting from the inconsistency of altitude measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the FAA searched and did not find any midair collisions occurring under high barometric pressure, the combination
of low visibility conditions, such as at night or in fog, and lack of consistent altitude measurement increases the
risk for all aircraft in the airspace system under high barometric conditions. The rule will reduce that risk during
such weather conditions by establishing uniform procedures to reduce confusion and to prevent inadequately equipped
aircraft from flying into these conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pilots always risk a midair collision in busy airspace, and high barometric pressure heightens that risk. In Alaska,
the FAA recorded 28 near midair collisions from 1987 through 1989. Although the FAA cannot precisely quantify the
increase in risk, it is apparent that the risk of midair collisions increases substantially when pilots do not know
their precise altitude as under high barometric pressure. Additionally, the FAA estimates that the number of aircraft
flying in such conditions will increase by 30 percent over the next 10 years. The combination of increased risk due
to high barometric pressure and a nearly one-third increase in aircraft operating under these conditions makes a
midair collision much more likely. Without restrictions under high barometric conditions, there is a potential
for at least one midair collision. The discounted value of avoiding just one midair collision over the next 10 years
is $5.0 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates the discounted 10-year cost of the rule to be $3.0 million. This cost is the highest possible cost
assuming that all landings during extremely high barometric pressure are restricted. Aircraft with more sophisticated
avionics will be able to land even with restrictions in effect. Also, aircraft could land under VFR conditions. The
benefit of avoiding just one midair collision over the next ten years has a discounted value of $5.0 million, greater
than the estimated cost of the rule during that period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All foreign and domestic aircraft would be equally affected by this rule. Hence, this rule will have no effect on the
sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States. The rule also does not affect the sale of United
States products of services in foreign countries.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that government regulations do not needlessly and disproportionately
burden small businesses. The RFA requires FAA to review each rule that may have a ``significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA criteria set ``a substantial number'' as not less than 11 and at least one-third of the small entities subject
to the rule. Among air carriers, a small entity is defined as one that owns, but does not necessarily operate, 9 or fewer
aircraft. The criteria set ``a significant economic impact'' as follows: $101,988 for scheduled air carriers with
60 or more seats; $57,011 for scheduled air carriers with fewer than 60 seats; and $4,011 for unscheduled operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that in certain cases the cost of delays to small entities might exceed the threshold. However, the number
of small entities that this rule might affect is difficult to estimate. At any rate, only those small entities in Alaska
are likely to be affected by the rule since almost all extremely high pressure occurrences take place in Alaska. Of
the 77 part 135 commuters with 9 or fewer aircraft in the United States, 15 (or 19 percent) are located in Alaska. In the
case of unscheduled part 135 operators (air taxis) with 9 or fewer aircraft, only 6 percent of the 2,634 such operators
in the United States operate in Alaska. In each instance, the proportion of small entities exposed to costs under the
rule is considerably less than one-third.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the FAA determines that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

The regulation herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not significant under Executive
Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The regulations
is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory
evaluation, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the
docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under
