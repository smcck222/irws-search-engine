<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document gives notice of proposed amendments to the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) to: Eliminate
refunds of assessments; assess watermelon imports and add one or more importer members to the National Watermelon
Promotion Board (Board); exempt from assessments producers with less than 10 acres of watermelons rather than 5 acres
and importers of less than 150,000 pounds; cover all 50 States by the Plan; and revise the criteria for determining
the eligibility of producers to serve on the Board. In addition, conforming changes would be made to the rules and regulations
issued under the Plan and the rules of practice for petitions, and the rules of practice for referenda on the Plan would
be revised to provide for referenda to be conducted by mail ballot. These actions are necessary to implement amendments
to the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR Part 1210], hereinafter referred
as the Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993, [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916] hereinafter referred as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. There are approximately
140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes proposed to the Plan, rules and regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and procedures for conduct
of referenda are as a result of amendments to the Act. The overall economic impact of these proposed changes is not expected
to be significant. Including all 50 States and the District of Columbia under the Plan would have little impact. The
producer exemption from assessments would be increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. This change would benefit small producers
because it will increase the exemption level, and small producers would not have to pay the assessment. Neither the
eligibility criteria for determining if a person is a handler or a producer nor the change to voting by mail ballot would
have any economic impact. The elimination of refunds may have some impact on a small amount of producers and handlers
who are currently entitled to refunds. There would also be a new burden on importers caused by the assessment of imports,
but importers are currently benefiting from the activities which promote watermelons without paying assessments.
The research and promotion program is expected to benefit producers, handlers, and importers subject to the plan
by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements
contained in the Plan have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0093. There would be a new reporting burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the
OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093. Therefore, this action adds no additional reporting burden.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers
of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer
and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary
to verify their reporting.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced
watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993, 7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993
totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent. Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great
as the volume of imports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule invites comments on changes to the Plan, the rules and regulations issued thereunder, the rules
of practice for petitions, and the procedures for the conduct of referenda. The changes are proposed in accordance
with amendments to the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916] as made in the Watermelon
Research and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers, and
the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum.
Watermelon imports enter the country primarily during the winter season. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled
343.5 million pounds. The assessment rate for imports would be the combined total assessment rate paid by producers
and handlers of domestic watermelons. The current assessment rate for producers is 2 cents per hundredweight and
for handlers is 2 cents per hundredweight. The combined assessment rate for importers, therefore, would be 4 cents
per hundredweight. Assessments would be paid at the time the watermelons enter the country. The collection of assessments
on imported watermelons would be expected to generate an additional $137,400 per year in revenue to the Board. In order
to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.200, 1210.201, 1210.202, and 1210.204 of the referendum
procedures; &sect;&sect;1210.305, 1210.320, 1210.321, 1210.328, 1210.341, 1210.350, 1210.351, 1210.352, 1210.363,
and 1210.364 of the Plan; &sect;&sect;1210.402 and 1210.405 of the nomination procedures; and &sect;&sect;1210.515,
1210.518, 1210.519, 1210.521, 1210.530, 1210.531, and 1210.532 of the rules and regulations. In addition, a new
&sect;1210.314 would be added to the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the collection of assessments on imported watermelons, the Secretary proposes that the United States
Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury be designated as the collecting agency for assessments levied on
such imports. Other commodity research and promotion programs utilize the Customs Service as a means of collecting
assessments on imported products, and the Customs Service is agreeable to collecting these watermelon assessments.
An agreement between the USDA and the Customs Service would be entered into to implement this action. In order to make
this change, this rule would amend section 1210.518 of the Rules and Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importer representation on the Board would be proportionate to the percentage of assessments paid by importers
to the Board, except that at least one representative of importers would serve on the Board if importers are subject
to the Plan. This representation would enable importers to participate in developing the Board's programs, plans,
and projects, and express their views and concerns on how Board funds are used if imports are assessed under the Plan.
Importers would nominate individuals to serve as importer members on the Board, and as required for other members
of the Board, two nominees would be submitted to the Secretary for each vacancy. The Act requires the number of importers
members to be proportionate to the assessments paid by importers. However, it is necessary to calculate the number
of initial importer members on the volume of imports because imports are not currently being assessed. There are currently
14 producers and 14 handlers on the Board. This is the equivalent of one domestic industry member for every 67.7 million
pounds of domestic production. Based on the average annual volume of imports during the last 3-year period (323.1
hundredweight), four importers would be added to the current Board. In order to make this change, this rule would amend
&sect;&sect;1210.202, 1210.203, 1210.320, 1210.321, and 1210.401. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for the elimination of refunds of assessments if the producers, handlers, and importers vote to eliminate
refunds. The refund provision has been in effect since the beginning of the program. Refunds have been increasing
every year from 9 percent in 1990 to almost 29 percent in 1993. If the refund provision is eliminated, it would provide
the Board with an estimated additional $250,000 per year for research and promotion activities. In order to make this
change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.343 and 1210.520. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the refund provision remains in the Plan, and importers are subject to the Plan, then importers would be entitled
to a refund of all assessments paid on watermelons imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act increases the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons.
Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year would be entitled to apply for a refund which would be
the producer equivalent of the import assessments. The 150,000-pound exemption level for importers is the level
determined to be equivalent to 10 acres of watermelons for domestic producers. In addition, the Act provides that
the Board has the authority to establish rules for producers to certify whether they are exempt from the assessments.
In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.201, 1210.341, 1210.342, 1210.518, and 1210.521.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
This amendment would expand the Plan to cover producers, handlers, and importers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the District
of Columbia. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.201 and 1210.305 and would add
a new &sect;1210.315.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1647(f) of the Act permits changes in the assessment rate through notice and comment rulemaking. No change
to the Plan would be necessary to implement this amendment to the Act because &sect;1210.341 of the Plan states that
assessment rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1647(f) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases
watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own
production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production
and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision
facilitates the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific
group. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.202, 1210.321, 1210.363, 1210.368,
and 1210.402. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also provides that all future referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension Service county offices. This
procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act would now allow referenda to be conducted by
mail ballot which would reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate a more timely tabulation
of the results. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.203, 1210.204, and 1210.363.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Act changes the criteria for determining the outcome of referenda. The Act previously provided that
the Plan should not be effective unless approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers and handlers voting in
the referendum, or producers and handlers of not less than two-thirds of the watermelons produced and handled during
the representative period by producers and handlers voting in the referendum, and by not less than a majority of the
producers and a majority of the handlers voting in the referendum. The Act now specifies that the determination of
the results of a referendum should be on the basis of a simple majority of the producers, handlers, and, if covered by
the Plan, importers voting in the referendum. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, &sect;1210.252 would be revised to correct a wording error made during the promulgation of the Plan
and &sect;1210.322 would be revised to delete obsolete language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;1210.325 would be changed to reflect a change in the number of Board members that constitute a majority.
This revision would reflect the addition of importer members to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1210.505 would be amended to reflect the fact that the Department issues user fee bills to the Board monthly
rather than quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, miscellaneous conforming changes would be made to &sect;&sect;1210.201, 1210.251, 1210.302, 1210.328,
1210.340, and 1210.362. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are encouraged to comment on the proposed amendments included in this rule. All written comments
received by the date specified herein will be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After all comments have been reviewed and any necessary changes made to these proposed amendments to the Plan, the
proposals will be published together with a referendum order. The referendum order will set the dates for eligible
producers, handlers, and importers to vote on whether or not they favor (1) eliminating the provisions for assessment
refunds and (2) implementing assessments on imported watermelons and adding importer members to the Board.

handled in the United States and all watermelons imported into the United States for consumption as human food. No
more than one assessment on a producer, handler, or importer shall be made on any lot of watermelons. The handler shall
be assessed an equal amount on a per unit basis as the producer. If a person performs both producing and handling functions
on any same lot of watermelons, both assessments shall be paid by such person. In the case of an importer, the assessment
shall be equal to the combined rate for domestic producers and handlers and shall be paid by the importer at the time
of entry of the watermelons into the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is publishing for public comment a notice of receipt of a petition for rulemaking,
dated January 8, 1994, which was filed with the Commission by Steve Gannis. The petition was docketed by the NRC on February
8, 1994, and has been assigned Docket No. PRM&hyph;20&hyph;23. The petitioner requests that the NRC amend its regulations
to limit the annual dose of ionizing radiation that is received by the general public from 100 millirems annually to
under 1 millirem annually. The petitioner also requests that if the NRC does not establish a limit of 1 millirem annually,
it establish a substantially lower limit than the current 100 millirems annually.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has established standards for protection against ionizing radiation resulting from activities conducted
under licensees and has issued these standards in the regulations codified in 10 CFR part 20. These regulations are
intended to control the receipt, possession, use, transfer, and disposal of licensed material by its licensees.
Licensed material is any source, byproduct, or special nuclear material received, possessed, used, transferred,
or disposed of under a general or specific license issued by the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner believes that it is vital to the public interest and public health that a lower radiation dose limit
be established because the higher dose limit is a possible source of an unacceptable number of additional cancers.
The petitioner indicates that the NRC stated in its ``Below Regulatory Concern'' policy statement (issued July 3,
1990; 55 FR 27522, and withdrawn August 24, 1993; 58 FR 44610) that if the public is exposed to 100 millirems of radiation
annually over a lifetime, 1 person out of every 285 people would get fatal cancer. The petitioner states that this number
does not include the nonfatal cancers that would be caused. Furthermore, the petitioner states that the 100 millirems
is in addition to the approximately 90 millirems of radiation the average person receives annually from natural background
radiation sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the Federal Government standards on how much cancer can be caused among the public by cancer-causing
pollutants and contaminants generally permit, at most, approximately 1 cancer per million people. The petitioner
therefore requests that a lower radiation dose limit be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner requests that the NRC issue a regulation that would limit to under 1 millirem the annual
dose of ionizing radiation received by any member of the public. The petitioner's requested limit would include the
exposure received from the combined sources of radiation exposure resulting from activities regulated by the NRC.
The petitioner also requests that in the event the NRC does not establish an exposure limit of under 1 millirem, the
NRC establish a substantially lower limit than the current 100-millirem limit.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to May 4, 1994, the comment period on the notice of proposed rulemaking
that would require specific indication, warning, and direction statements in the labeling of over-the-counter
(OTC) antacid drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient (February 2, 1994, 59 FR 5060).
FDA is taking this action in response to a request to extend the comment period for an additional 30 days to allow more
time to comment on this proposal. The comment period for these issues closed on April 4, 1994. This proposal is part
of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 2, 1994 (59 FR 5060), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the final monograph for OTC antacid
drug products to require specific indication, warning, and direction statements in the labeling of products containing
sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient (hereinafter referred to as the February 1994, proposal). The new labeling
would be required only for oral dosage forms intended to be dissolved in liquid prior to administration, such as powders
and effervescent granules or tablets. As proposed, no such oral dosage forms containing sodium bicarbonate as an
active ingredient would be allowed to make a claim for ``relief of overindulgence in food and drink.'' The proposed
warnings would alert consumers to avoid antacid drug products containing sodium bicarbonate when the stomach is
overly full from eating and drinking. The proposed directions would inform consumers that sodium bicarbonate should
be completely dissolved before drinking and that the recommended dose should not be exceeded. FDA issued the February
1994, proposal after receiving reports of gastric (stomach) rupture following ingestion of sodium bicarbonate
to relieve gastrointestinal distress. Interested persons were given until April 4, 1994, to submit comments on the
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 28, 1994, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), a trade association representing
the manufacturers and distributors of OTC medicines, requested that the comment period be extended for at least 30
days. NDMA stated that the extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to develop comprehensive comments to
submit to the agency. NDMA explained that most companies that distribute OTC drug products containing sodium bicarbonate
as an active ingredient were not anticipating changes in the antacid final monograph and the February 1994, proposal
provided the first opportunity for many affected parties to become aware of the agency's concerns and intentions
for amending the monograph. NDMA stated that interested parties have had insufficient time to acquire the reference
materials cited by FDA, to retrieve relevant product experience reports, and to research thoroughly the issues raised
in FDA's February 1994, proposal. NDMA also mentioned that the time period for the comments includes several days
on which many company employees will not be working because of religious holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has carefully considered the request and believes that this additional time for comment is in the public interest.
Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to May 4, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before May 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding OTC antacid drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient. Three copies
of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with
the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

OSM is announcing receipt of a request from the Hopi Tribe regarding its AMLR plan (hereinafter, the ``Hopi Tribe plan'')
under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The Tribe has requested the concurrence of the
Secretary of the Department of the Interior with its certification of completion of coal reclamation under the Hopi
Tribe plan. If the Secretary concurs with the certification, the Hopi Tribe intends to request AMLR funds for construction
of public facilities in areas of the Hopi Reservation impacted by coal development, mining, or processing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background on Title IV of SMCRA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title IV of SMCRA established an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and waters adversely
affected by past mining. The program is funded by a reclamation fee levied on the production of coal. Lands and waters
eligible for reclamation under title IV are those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or inadequately
reclaimed prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State, Federal,
Tribal, or other laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV provides for State or Tribal submittal to OSM of an AMLR plan. The Secretary of the Interior adopted regulations
in 30 CFR parts 870 through 888 that implement Title IV of SMCRA. Under these regulations, the Secretary reviewed the
plans submitted by States and Tribes and solicited and considered comments of State and Federal agencies and the public.
Based upon the comments received, the Secretary determined whether a State or Tribe had the ability and necessary
legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV. After making such a determination, the Secretary decided whether
to approve the State or Tribe program and granted the State or Tribe exclusive authority to administer its approved
plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ordinarily, under section 405 of SMCRA, a State or Tribe must have an approved surface mining regulatory program prior
to submittal of an AMLR plan to OSM. However, on July 11, 1987, the President signed a supplemental appropriations
bill (Pub. L. 100&hyph;71) that authorized the Crow, Navajo, and Hopi Tribes to adopt AMLR programs without approval
of Tribal surface mining regulatory programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon approval of a State's or Tribe's plan by the Secretary, the State or Tribe may submit to OSM, on an annual basis,
an application for funds to be expended by that State or Tribe on specific projects that are necessary to implement
the approved plan. Such annual requests are reviewed and approved by OSM in accordance with the requirements of 30
CFR Part 886.

II. Background on the Hopi Tribe Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 28, 1988, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Hopi Tribe plan. General background information on the
Hopi Tribe plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the Hopi Tribe
plan can be found in the June 28, 1988, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 24262). Approval of the Hopi Tribe plan is codified at 30 CFR 756.15.

III. Discussion of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated February 2, 1994, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Hopi Tribe notified the Secretary
of the Interior that the Tribe had satisfied the requirements of SMCRA in regard to abandoned coal mine reclamation
and was, therefore, requesting the Secretary's concurrence with certification of completion of all known coal-related
problems (administrative record No. HO&hyph;002&hyph;FOR).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Public Comment Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 411 of SMCRA, OSM is seeking public comments and information concerning any known or suspected
unreclaimed lands and water resources on Hopi lands that may have been adversely affected by coal mining practices
prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State, Federal Tribal,
or other laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the Secretary concur with the certification, the Tribe intends to request, in accordance with 30 CFR part 886,
AMLR funding for the construction of public facilities as provided under sections 411 (e) and (f) of SMCRA.If no past
coal mining problems eligible for funding under section 404 of SMCRA are identified through this process, the Secretary
intends to concur with the Tribe's certification. If, after the Secretary's concurrence, a coal problem occurs or
is identified, the Tribe would have to seek immediate funding for reclaiming the coal-related problem.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Written Comments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the Hopi Tribe's request for certification of completion of
coal reclamation, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after
the time indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
dates
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 4 p.m., m.d.t. on April 29, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

3. Public Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the Tribe's request may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

V. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State or Tribal AMLR plans and revisions thereof
since each such plan is drafted and promulgated by a specific State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions on proposed State
or Tribal AMLR plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State or Tribe are based on a determination of whether the
submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the applicable Federal regulations
at 30 CFR parts 884 and 888.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State or Tribal AMLR
plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The Tribal submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon Federal regulations for which an economic analysis
was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA or
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the Tribe. In making the determination as to whether this rule

the corresponding Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Postal Service has exempted certain systems of records that it maintains from specific provisions of the Privacy
Act. At the time it adopted the exemptions contained in its Privacy Act regulations (39 CFR 266.9), the Postal Service
stated its reasons for each exemption in the preamble of the notice of proposed rulemaking (40 FR 37227, dated August
26, 1975). This proposed rule does not change the current application of exemptions, but merely incorporates into
&sect;266.9 the reasons for applying each exemption to a particular system.

(a) Subsections 552a(j) and (k) of Title 5, U.S.C., empower the Postmaster General to exempt systems of records meeting
certain criteria from various other subsections of section 552a. With respect to systems of records so exempted,
nothing in this part shall require compliance with provisions hereof implementing any subsections of section 552a
from which those systems have been exempted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a summary of the Act's provisions for which exemption is claimed pursuant
to, and to the extent permitted by, subsection 552a (j) and (k) of Title 5, U.S.C., for some systems of records. Paragraphs
(b) (2) through (6) of this section identify the exempted systems of records, the exemptions applied to each, and the
reasons for the exemptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Explanation of Act's provisions for which an exemption is claimed in the systems discussed below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Subsection (c)(3) requires an agency to make available to the individual named in the records an accounting of
each disclosure of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Subsection (c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency to which a record has been disclosed
of any correction or notation of dispute it has made to the record in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Subsection (d), paragraphs (1)&hyph;(4) require an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records
about the individual, to request amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such
records, and to provide a statement of disagreement about a disputed record to be filed and disclosed with the disputed
record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Subsection (e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as
is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Subsection (e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from
the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights,
benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Subsection (e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information of the authority
under which the information is sought, the purposes for which the information will be used, the routine uses that may
be made of the information, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and the effects of not providing the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Subsection (e)(4), paragraphs (G) and (H) require an agency to publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of its procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request whether the system of records contains
information about the individual, how to gain access to any record about the individual contained in the system, and
how to contest its content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Subsection (e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness,
and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in making any determination about
the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Subsection (e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record
on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter
of public record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Subsection (f) requires an agency to establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request
if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the individual, obtain access to the
record, and request amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Subsection (g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the access and amendment provisions
of subsections (d)(1) and (d)(3), and with other provisions of the Act, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such
a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.

a system of records to accomplish an agency function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Inspection Requirements_Investigative File System, USPS 080.010 and Inspection Requirements_Mail Cover
Program, USPS 080.020. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4), (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(1)&hyph;3,
(e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5) and (8), (f), (g), and (m). The reasons for exemption follow:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1)&hyph;(d)(4) could (A) alert subjects
that they are targets of an investigation or mail cover; (B) alert subjects of the nature and scope of the investigation,
and of evidence obtained; (C) enable the subject of an investigation to avoid detection or apprehension; (D) subject
confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel to harassment or intimidation if their identities
were released to the target of an investigation; (E) constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of
third parties who are involved in a certain investigation; (F) intimidate potential witnesses and cause them to be
reluctant to offer information; (G) lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction or alteration
of evidence yet to be discovered, the fabrication of testimony, or the compromising of classified material; and (H)
seriously impede or compromise law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations which may involve law
enforcement aspects as a result of the above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Application of subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) is impractical because the relevance, necessity, or correctness
of specific information may be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses.
As to relevance (subsection (e)(1)), effective law enforcement requires the keeping of information not relevant
to a specific Postal Service investigation. Such information may be kept to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement
and to establish patterns of activity which may relate to the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service and/or
other agencies. As to accuracy (subsection (e)(5)), the correctness of records sometimes can be established only
in a court of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would require collection of information directly from the subject
of a potential or ongoing investigation. The subject would be put on alert that he or she is a target of an investigation
or mail cover, enabling avoidance of detection or apprehension, thereby seriously compromising law enforcement,
mail cover, or background investigations involving law enforcement aspects. Moreover, in certain circumstances
the subject of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators, and information must
be collected from other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The requirements of subsection (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the individual
access and amendment provisions of subsection d. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures since access may be appropriate in some cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject
of the investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply because exemption from the provisions of subsection (d) renders
the provisions on suits to enforce (d) inapplicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Personnel Records_Preemployment Investigation Records, USPS 120.110 and Personnel Records_Postmaster Selection
Program Records, USPS 120.130. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a, (d)(1)&hyph;(4) and (e)(1)
to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity
of a source who furnished information to the Government in confidence as a part of an investigation conducted solely
for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment. The
reasons for exemption follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the course of its investigation and evaluation of an applicant for a position, the Postal Service contacts individuals
who, without an assurance of anonymity, would refuse to provide information concerning the subject of the investigation.
If a record subject were given access pursuant to (d)(1)&hyph;(d)(4), the promised confidentiality would be breached
and the confidential source would be identified. The result would be restriction of the free flow of information vital
to a determination of an individual's qualifications and suitability for appointment to or continued occupancy
of his position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In collecting information for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance
what information may be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability of an individual for appointment.
Information that seems irrelevant, when linked with other information, can sometimes provide a composite picture
of an individual which assists in determining whether that individual should be appointed to or retained in a position.
For this reason, exemption from subsection (e)(1) is claimed.

(4) USPS 120.120, Personnel Records_Personnel Research and Test Validation Records; and USPS 120.152, Personnel
Records_Career Development and Training Records. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1)&hyph;(4),
(e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. The
reasons for exemption follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) These systems contain questions and answers to standard testing materials, the disclosure of which would compromise
the fairness of the future use of these materials. It is not feasible to develop entirely new examinations after each
administration as would be necessary if questions or answers were available for inspection and copying. Consequently,
exemption from subsection (d) is claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) do not apply to these systems for which exemption from
subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures since access to system records that do not compromise the objectivity or fairness
of the testing examination process may be appropriate in some cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) USPS 120.151, Personnel Records_Recruiting, Examining, and Appointment Records. This system is exempt from
5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject
to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who has furnished information
to the Government in confidence as part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability,
eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment and (k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity
or fairness of the testing or examination process. The reasons for exemption follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), application
of the provisions at (d)(1)&hyph;(4) would reveal to the applicant whose suitability is being investigated the identity
of individuals who supplied information under a promise of anonymity. As a result, the Postal Service's promise of
confidentiality would be breached, its ability to obtain information in the future would be diminished, and the information
source could be subjected to harassment by the applicant. To the extent that information in this system is subject
to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), the requirements of the exemption at (d)(1)&hyph;(4) and the reasons
for exemption information relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination
process are the same as those given in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.

(ii) The reasons for exempting this system of records from subsection (e)(1) are the same as those given in paragraph
(b)(4)(ii) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) do not apply to this system for which exemption from
subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures since access to system records that do not compromise the objectivity or fairness
of the testing or examination process or reveal the identity of a confidential source may be appropriate in some cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) USPS 030.010, Equal Employment Opportunity_EEO Discrimination Complaint Investigations. This system is exempt
from 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject
to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) as material compiled for law enforcement purposes and (k)(5) as relating
to the identity of a source who has furnished information to the Government in confidence as a part of an investigation
conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for
employment. The reasons for exemption follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), application
of the requirements of the exemption at (d) (1)&hyph;(4) would cause disruption of enforcement of the laws relating
to equal employment opportunity (EEO). To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), application of the provisions at (d)(1)&hyph;(4) would reveal to the EEO complainant the
identity of individuals who supplied information under a promise of anonymity. It is essential to the integrity of
the EEO complaint system that information collected in the investigative process not be prematurely disclosed and
that witnesses be free from restraint, interference, coercion, or reprisal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) do not apply to this system for which exemption from
subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures since access to system records that do not compromise the investigative process or
reveal the identify of confidential sources may be appropriate in some cases.

 This proposal announces that E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Barley Mill Plaza, P.O. Box 80038, Wilmington,
DE 19880-0038, has submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 1F3961 and 1F3962 to EPA proposing that 40 CFR part 180 be amended
under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, by establishing tolerances for the herbicides
thifensulfuron methyl (methyl-3-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]carbonyl]amino] sulfonyl]-2-thiophene
carboxylate) and tribenuron methyl (methyl-2-[[[[N-(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) methylamino]carbonyl]
amino]sulfonyl] benzoate), each on the raw agricultural commodities (RAC) oat grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm)
and oat straw at 0.1 ppm.

The Dietary Risk Evaluation System (DRES) chronic analysis for thifensulfuron methyl used a Reference Dose (RfD)
of 0.013 mg/kg body weight/day, based on a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 1.25 mg/kg bwt/day and an uncertainty
factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 2-year feeding study in rats which demonstrated as an effect lower body weight
gains in males. Serum sodium in males and females was sporadically lower throughout the study. This RfD has been approved
by both the HED (2/25/88) and Agency RfD (3/23/88) committees. Food uses evaluated in this analysis for thifensulfuron
methyl were the published tolerances (barley, soybeans, and wheat) found in 40 CFR 180.439 and the Tolerance Index
System (TIS), plus a pending tolerance on corn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This chronic exposure analysis was performed for thifensulfuron methyl using tolerance level residues and 100 percent
crop treated information to estimate the Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population
and 22 population subgroups. The TMRC for the general population from all published tolerances is 1.1 X 10

The DRES chronic analysis for tribenuron methyl used a RfD of 0.008 mg/kg bwt/day, based on a NOEL of 0.79 mg/kg bwt/day

Food uses evaluated in this analysis for tribenuron methyl were the published tolerances (barley and wheat) found
in 40 CFR 180.451 and TIS. Currently there are no other pending tolerances for tribenuron methyl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The chronic exposure analysis performed for tribenuron methyl used tolerance level residues and 100-percent crop

DRES considers the dietary risks from thifensulfuron methyl and tribenuron methyl on oats to be of minimal concern.
Also, considering that the proposed uses are given at tolerance level and 100% crop treated values were used there
is likely an overestimation of exposures. Exposure from residues for thifensulfuron methyl through oats represents
less then 1% of the RfD for the U.S. population. Similarly, exposure from residues for tribenuron methyl through oats
represents less then 1% of the RfD for the U.S. population. Based on these values, EPA concludes that the chronic dietary
risk for residues of thifensulfuron methyl and tribenuron methyl through the proposed use on oat grain is minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 409 tolerances for thifensulfuron methyl and tribenuron methyl on oat processed commodities are not needed
because residues are not expected to concentrate on processing.

There are no pending regulatory actions against the registration of these pesticides. These pesticides are useful
for the purpose for which these tolerances are sought. Adequate analytical methodology is available for enforcement
purposes. The method is not yet published in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II), but can be obtained
in the interim period as follows: By mail from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field
Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington,

Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR 180
would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the revocation of all tolerances and food additive and feed additive regulations (``tolerances'')
established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348)
for residues of the herbicides tributylphosphorotrithioite, 2-chloroallyldiethyldithiocarbamate, norea,
barban, sodium trichloroacetate, dinitramine, dipropetryn and bifenox; the plant regulators 1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene
and cycloheximide; the insecticides

-(dimethylsulfamoyl) phenyl phosphorothioate (including its oxygen analog), crotoxyphos, pirimiphos-ethyl,
chlorfenvinphos, phenothiazine, and flucythrinate; and the fungicide hexachlorophene in or on raw agricultural
commodities (RACs), processed foods, and feeds. EPA is initiating this action because all registered uses of these
pesticide chemicals in or on RACs and processed foods have been canceled. The registrations for these pesticide chemicals
were canceled because the registrant failed to pay the required maintenance fee, or the registrant voluntarily canceled
all registered uses of the pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because there are no current food use registrations for any of these 17 pesticide chemicals, EPA proposes to revoke
the tolerances and food additive and feed additive regulations for these pesticide chemicals. A tolerance, food
additive, or feed additive regulation is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered
for a particular food use. The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these regulations.
Since there are no food use registrations of these products, and hence no legal use in the United States, and since these
pesticides are either not persistent, or sufficient time has elapsed since the prior use for residues to dissipate,
residues should not appear in any domestically produced commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tolerances and food and feed additive regulations listed in 40 CFR parts 180, 185, and 186 being proposed for revocation
are as follows: &sect;180.186 (tributylphosphorotrithioite), &sect;180.203 (1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene),

of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation revoking the RAC tolerances
and processed food and feed additive regulations. Further, EPA is soliciting comments from anyone adversely affected
by revocation of these tolerances and food and feed additive regulations. EPA requests that any person adversely
affected by these revocations submit information providing the following specific information: 1. Are there any
existing stocks of the chemical? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If so, how much? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. When will the stocks be depleted? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. How long would the commodities treated with these chemicals be in the channels of trade?

 Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300328]. All written comments filed
in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response Section, at the Virginia

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires the Agency initially to determine whether a proposed regulatory action being proposed
or issued is a ``significant'' rule and therefore subject to the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e. Regulatory
Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations,
or small governmental jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all domestic registrations for use of these 17 pesticide chemicals have been canceled, it is anticipated that
no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances and food and feed additive
regulations are revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DFARS 225.7303&hyph;2(a) is amended to revise the language on offset administrative costs. The revision originated
based on a Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) procedural change. DSAA will issue a corresponding revision
to the Security Assistance Management Manual. In addition to the revision of offset administrative costs, the language
currently in 225.7303&hyph;2(a) (1) and (2) has been combined to make it more clear and all subparagraphs under 225.7303&hyph;2(a)
have been renumbered accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because it eliminates a procedural requirement for contractor recovery of offset administrative costs, under
foreign military sale contracts. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed.
Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning
the affected DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be
submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 225.7303&hyph;2 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
225.7303&hyph;2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Cost of doing business with a foreign government or an international organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as described in 225.7303&hyph;1 do not exist, recognize
the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a foreign government or international organization, even
though such costs might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense contracts. Examples of such
costs include, but are no limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR part 31), e.g._
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR subpart 3.4;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales to foreign governments. Paragraph 126.8 of
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR part 121) may require Government approval for these
costs to be allowable. If Government approval is required for promotion or demonstration costs to be allowable, the
approval must be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, manuals, or other related data; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Technical field services provided in a foreign country related to accident investigations, weapon system problems,
operations/tactics enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Offset administrative costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A U.S. defense contractor may recover costs incurred to administer specific requirements of its offset agreement
with a foreign government or international organization if the foreign military sale Letter of Offer and Acceptance
is financed wholly with customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset requirement or to bear any of the
associated costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Some examples of offset administrative costs are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) In-house and/or purchased: organizational, administrative and technical support, including offset staffing;
quality assurance, manufacturing, purchasing support; data acquisition; proposal, transaction and report preparation;
broker/trading services; legal support; and similar support activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Off-shore operations for technical representative and consultant activities, office operations, customer
and industry interface, capability surveys;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Marketing assistance and related technical assistance, transfer of technical information and relating training;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Employee travel and subsistence costs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Taxes and duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance
understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing,
and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirements
(as distinguished from contracts for FMS).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a proposed regulation under the Clean Water Act to limit the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters
of the United States and into publicly owned treatment works by existing and new facilities that formulate, package
or repackage products containing pesticide active ingredients. This regulation proposes effluent limitations
guidelines based on ``best practicable control technology (BPT)'', ``best conventional pollutant control technology
(BCT)'', ``best available technology (BAT)'', new source performance standards (NSPS), and pretreatment standards
for new and existing indirect dischargers (PSNS and PSES, respectively). The existing effluent limitations guidelines
based on the achievement of BPT are not being changed by this proposed regulation. EPA is also proposing to establish
a new subcategory which applies to refilling establishments whose principal business is retail sale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is being proposed under the authorities of sections 301, 304, 306, 307, and 501 of the Clean Water Act
(the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95&hyph;217, and the Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;4),
also referred to as ``the Act.''

A. Clean Water Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 established a comprehensive program to ``restore and
maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters,'' (section 101(a)). To implement
the Act, EPA is to issue effluent limitations guidelines, pretreatment standards and new source performance standards
for industrial dischargers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These guidelines and standards are summarized briefly below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) (Section 304(b)(1) of the Act)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BPT effluent limitations guidelines are generally based on the average of the best existing performance by plants
of various sizes, ages, and unit processes within the category or subcategory for control of pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing BPT effluent limitations guidelines, EPA considers the total cost of achieving effluent reductions
in relation to the effluent reduction benefits, the age of equipment and facilities involved, the processes employed,
process changes required, engineering aspects of the control technologies, non-water quality environmental impacts
(including energy requirements) and other factors as the EPA Administrator deems appropriate (Section 304(b)(1)(B)
of the Act). The Agency considers the category or subcategory-wide cost of applying the technology in relation to
the effluent reduction benefits. Where existing performance is uniformly inadequate, BPT may be transferred from
a different subcategory or category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT) (Sections 304(b)(2)(B) and 307(a)(2) of the Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, BAT effluent limitations represent the best existing economically achievable performance of plants
in the industrial subcategory or category. The Act establishes BAT as the principal national means of controlling
the direct discharge of priority pollutants and nonconventional pollutants to navigable waters. The factors considered
in assessing BAT include the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, potential process changes,
and non-water quality environmental impacts (including energy requirements) (Section 304(b)(2)(B)). The Agency
retains considerable discretion in assigning the weight to be accorded these factors. As with BPT, where existing
performance is uniformly inadequate, BAT may be transferred from a different subcategory or category. BAT may include
process changes or internal controls, even when these technologies are not common industry practice.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1977 Amendments added Section 301(b)(2)(E) to the Act establishing BCT for discharges of conventional pollutants
from existing industrial point sources. Section 304(a)(4) designated the following as conventional pollutants:
Biochemical oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), fecal coliform, pH, and any additional
pollutants defined by the Administrator as conventional. The Administrator designated oil and grease as an additional
conventional pollutant on July 30, 1979 (44 FR 44501). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCT is not an additional limitation, but replaces BAT for the control of conventional pollutants. In addition to other
factors specified in Section 304(b)(4)(B), the Act requires that BCT limitations be established in light of a two
part ``cost-reasonableness'' test.

660 F.2d 954 (4th Cir. 1981). EPA's current methodology for the general development of BCT limitations was issued
in 1986 (51 FR 24974; July 9, 1986).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) (Section 306 of the Act)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSPS are based on the best available demonstrated treatment technology. New plants have the opportunity to install
the best and most efficient production processes and wastewater treatment technologies. As a result, NSPS should
represent the most stringent numerical values attainable through the application of the best available control
technology for all pollutants (i.e., conventional, nonconventional, and priority pollutants). In establishing
NSPS, EPA is directed to take into consideration the cost of achieving the effluent reduction and any non-water quality
environmental impacts and energy requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) (Section 307(b) of the Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PSES are designed to prevent the discharge of pollutants that pass through, interfere with, or are otherwise incompatible
with the operation of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The Act requires pretreatment standards for pollutants
that pass through POTWs or interfere with POTWs' treatment processes or sludge disposal methods. The legislative
history of the 1977 Act indicates that pretreatment standards are to be technology-based and analogous to the BAT
effluent limitations guidelines for removal of toxic pollutants. For the purpose of determining whether to promulgate
national category-wide pretreatment standards, EPA generally determines that there is pass-through of a pollutant
and thus a need for categorical standards if the nation-wide average percent removal of a pollutant removed by well-operated
POTWs achieving secondary treatment is less than the percent removed by the BAT model treatment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Pretreatment Regulations, which set forth the framework for the implementation of categorical pretreatment
standards, are found at 40 CFR part 403. (Those regulations contain a definition of pass-through that addresses localized
rather than national instances of pass-through and does not use the percent removal comparison test described above.
See 52 FR 1586, January 14, 1987.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS) (Section 307(b) of the Act)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like PSES, PSNS are designed to prevent the discharges of pollutants that pass through, interfere with, or are otherwise
incompatible with the operation of POTWs. PSNS are to be issued at the same time as NSPS. New indirect dischargers,
like the new direct dischargers, have the opportunity to incorporate into their plants the best available demonstrated
technologies. The Agency considers the same factors in promulgating PSNS as it considers in promulgating NSPS.

B. Section 304(m) Requirements and Litigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 304(m) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(m)), added by the Water Quality Act of 1987, requires EPA to establish
schedules for (i) reviewing and revising existing effluent limitations guidelines and standards (``effluent guidelines''),
and (ii) promulgating new effluent guidelines. On January 2, 1990, EPA published an Effluent Guidelines Plan (55
FR 80), in which schedules were established for developing new and revised effluent guidelines for several industry
categories. One of the industries for which the Agency established a schedule was the Pesticide Chemicals category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC) and Public Citizen, Inc., challenged the Effluent Guidelines Plan
in a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civ. No. 89&hyph;2980). The plaintiffs charged that EPA's plan did not meet the requirements of sec. 304(m). A Consent
Decree in this litigation was entered by the Court on January 31, 1992. The terms of the Consent Decree are reflected
in the Effluent Guidelines Plan published on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41000). This plan requires, among other things,
that EPA propose effluent guidelines for the formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategories of the Pesticide
Chemicals category by January, 1994 and take final action on these effluent guidelines by August, 1995. EPA filed
a motion with the court in November, 1993 requesting an extension of time until March 31, 1994, for the EPA Administrator
to sign the proposed regulation.

C. Pollution Prevention Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA) (42 U.S.C. 13101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, November 5, 1990) makes pollution prevention the national policy of the United States. The
PPA identifies an environmental management hierarchy in which pollution ``should be prevented or reduced whenever
feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner, whenever feasible;
pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible;
and disposal or release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Sec. 6602;
42 U.S.C. 13103). In short, preventing pollution before it is created is preferable to trying to manage, treat or dispose
of it after it is created. According to the PPA, source reduction reduces the generation and release of hazardous substances,
pollutants, wastes, contaminants or residuals at the source, usually within a process. The term source reduction
``include equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign
of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory
control. The term `source reduction' does not include any practice which alters the physical, chemical, or biological
characteristics or the volume of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a process or activity
which itself is not integral to or necessary for the production of a product or the providing of a service.'' In effect,
source reduction means reducing the amount of a pollutant that enters a waste stream or that is otherwise released
into the environment prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PPA directs the Agency to, among other things, ``review regulations of the Agency prior and subsequent to their
proposal to determine their effect on source reduction'' (Sec. 6604; 42 U.S.C. 13103). This directive led the Agency
to implement a pilot project called the Source Reduction Review Project that would facilitate the integration of
source reduction in the Agency's regulations, including the technology based effluent guidelines and standards.
(See Section IV. B. for a more complete discussion of the Source Reduction Review Project.)

D. Prior Regulation and Litigation for the Pesticide Chemicals Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA promulgated BPT regulations for the Pesticide Chemicals Category on April 25, 1978 (43 FR 17778; 40 CFR part 455),
and September 29, 1978 (43 FR 44846; 40 CFR part 455, subpart A). The BPT effluent limitations guidelines established
a zero discharge limitation for the pesticide formulating and packaging subcategory (subpart C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several industry members challenged the BPT regulation on April 26, 1978 and the U.S. Court of Appeals remanded them
on two minor issues [

614 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1980)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 30, 1982, EPA proposed additional regulations to control the discharge of wastewater pollutants from
pesticide chemical operations to navigable waters and to POTWs (47 FR 53994). The proposed regulations included
effluent limitations guidelines based upon BPT, BAT, BCT, NSPS, PSES, and PSNS. The proposed effluent limitation
guidelines and standards covered the organic pesticide chemicals manufacturing segment, the metallo-organic
chemicals manufacturing segment and the formulating and packaging segment of the pesticide chemical industry.
In addition, the Agency proposed guidelines for test procedures to analyze the nonconventional pesticide pollutants
covered by these regulations on February 10, 1983 (48 FR 8250). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the new information collected by EPA in response to the comments on the November 30, 1982 proposal, on June
13, 1984, EPA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) of new information (49 FR 24492). In this NOA, the Agency indicated
it was considering changing its approach to developing regulation for this industry. EPA requested comments on the
data. EPA published a second NOA of new information on January 24, 1985, which primarily made available for public
review technical and economic data which had previously been claimed confidential by industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued a final rule on October 4, 1985, that limited the discharge of pollutants into navigable wastewaters and
into POTWs (50 FR 40672). The regulation included effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the BAT, NSPS,
PSES, and PSNS levels of control for new and existing facilities that were engaged in the manufacture and/or formulation
and packaging of pesticides. The regulation also established analytical methods for 61 pesticide active ingredients
for which the Agency had not previously promulgated approved test procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several parties filed petitions in the Court of Appeals challenging various aspects of the pesticide regulation
[
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(86&hyph;8024)]. After a review of the database supporting the regulation the Agency found flaws in the basis for
these effluent limitations guidelines and standards. Subsequently, the Agency and the parties filed a joint motion
for a voluntary remand of the regulation in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court dismissed the case on July
25, 1986, in response to the Joint Motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of the parties' motion to modify the dismissal, on August 29, 1986, the Court modified its order
to clarify the terms of the dismissal. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that: (1) The effluent limitation
guidelines and standards for the pesticide chemicals industry be remanded to EPA for reconsideration and further
rulemaking; and (2) EPA publish a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice removing the remanded pesticide regulation from the Code of Federal Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA formally withdrew the regulations on December 15, 1986 (51 FR 44911). Although the Agency found no errors in the
analytical methods promulgated October 4, 1985, it withdrew these methods to allow for further testing and possible
revision. The BPT limitations that were published on April 25, 1978, and September 29, 1978, were not affected by the
withdrawal notice and remain in effect. Those existing BPT limitations regulations are not proposed to be changed
in today's notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1993, (58 FR 50637) EPA published additional effluent limitations guidelines and standards under
subpart A of part 455, which covers manufacturers of organic pesticide active ingredients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has already issued final effluent guidelines limitations and standards for the manufacturing of pesticide active
ingredients covered by subcategories A and B and BPT effluent limitations guidelines for subcategory C (as previously
mentioned). Subpart D contains the analytical methods promulgated as part of the September 28, 1993, rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In today's notice, EPA is proposing to expand water pollution control requirements for the pesticide formulating

previously established in regulations which are based on zero discharge. EPA is also proposing to establish PSES
and PSNS for this subcategory. All formulating packaging and repackaging waste streams would be covered by the regulations
except for certain waste streams from a subgroup of facilities that process products containing sanitizer chemicals,
as defined in the regulations.

The BPT regulation promulgated in 1978 under subpart C of part 455 prohibits the discharge of process wastewater pollutants
generated from formulating and packaging pesticide products. This regulation is not being changed. BPT regulations
for subpart E, a new subcategory, are proposed. The new subcategory applies to repackaging agricultural pesticides
when performed by refilling establishments whose principal business is retail sale. The proposed BPT for this subcategory
would require that there be zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Industry Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The industry as a whole is referred to as the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry. The subcategories
are referred to as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PFPR or subcategory C for the pesticides chemicals formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategory,
(including sanitizer pesticides formulating, packaging and repackaging); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Refilling establishments, or subcategory E for the repackaging at refilling establishments whose principal
business is retail sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry is made up of an estimated 5,200 facilities per EPA's
data base generated through the annual reports submitted by pesticide producing establishments. These facilities
are located throughout the country, with greater concentrations of refilling establishments located in the midwestern
and southeastern states to serve the agricultural market. Approximately 3,240 of these facilities are represented
by the data base for this rulemaking, which was developed primarily based on 272 pesticide active ingredients covered
by the manufacturing rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pesticide formulating is the mixing of pesticide active ingredient with inert ingredients without a chemical reaction
that changes the active ingredient. Pesticide formulations take all forms: Water-based liquid; organic solvent-based
liquid; dry products in granular, powder, solid forms; pressurized gases; and aerosols. The formulations can be
in a concentrated form requiring dilution before application or can be ready to apply. The packaging of the formulated
pesticide product is dependent on the type of formulation. Liquids generally are packaged into jugs, cans, or drums;
dry formulations generally are packaged into bags, boxes, drums, or jugs. Pressurized gases are packaged into cylinders.
Aerosols are packaged into aerosol cans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) [cite] requires that all products making a claim
of killing, mitigating or repelling pests be registered with EPA and bear a label directing the safe use of the product.
In addition, production of all pesticide products must be reported annually to EPA. Thus, EPA has extensive data on
the contents of pesticide products, their annual production, who formulates, packages or repackages these products
and the uses for which these products are registered. EPA's Office of Water made extensive use of this data in its analysis
of the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on 1988 FIFRA establishment registration data, EPA identified 3,241 pesticide formulating, packaging, and
repackaging facilities in the United States for the 272 active ingredients. Subsequently, EPA surveyed a stratified
random sample of these 3,240 facilities. Based on this survey, facilities were identified, an estimated 1,305 as
pesticide producing establishments involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging pesticide products and
the remaining 1,134 facilities as refilling establishments whose principal business is retail sales that only repackage
pesticide products. Based on these survey results, EPA estimates that for all of the PAIs covered by this rule, that
in 1988 there were 2,000 facilities involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging pesticide products and 1,810
refilling establishments, using 1991 regulation data, these numbers increased to 3,200 and 2,800 facilities respectively.
In addition, there were 48 pesticide manufacturing facilities that also formulated and packaged pesticide products.
EPA estimates that there could be as many as 13 additional manufacturing facilities that also formulate, package
and repackage pesticide products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, the formulating, packaging and repackaging industry produces products in different forms.
EPA has observed formulating, packaging or repackaging done a number of different ways ranging from very sophisticated
and automated formulation and packaging lines to completely manual lines. In general, for liquid products the process
involves mixing the active ingredient with liquid inert ingredients in a tank and then transferring the product to
containers. For dry products, the active ingredient may be sprayed in liquid form onto a dry substrate or it may be mixed
in dry form. Dry products may undergo processes for mixing, grinding, sifting and finally packaging. Formulating
aerosol products is the same as other liquid products, but the packaging is more complex and involves filling the container,
capping it, drawing a vacuum on the container, adding propellant under pressure, and sealing the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some other types of pesticide products manufactured include collars to repel and kill fleas and ticks, pesticides
that are micro-encapsulated, and pesticides that are formed into solid shapes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide industry is changing and efforts are being made to improve products to meet demands of consumers for
less toxic and safer pesticides. For example, water-based solutions are gradually replacing organic solvents in
liquid pesticide formulating. Developments in packaging also are underway. For example, the growing use of water
soluble packages can reduce worker exposure to pesticides and minimize problems with disposal of packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1,130 refilling establishments represent a new population of facilities that was identified in the Agency's
Survey of Pesticide Producing Establishments. The survey sought to identify all facilities that reported formulating,
packaging or repackaging pesticide products in their annual report of 1988. (This survey is described more fully
in section V.A.2.) Somewhat unexpectedly, EPA discovered a significant population of facilities that reported
repackaging only. These facilities are retail dealers of agricultural chemicals and farm supplies. These facilities
repackage pesticide chemicals, usually herbicides, into refillable containers which are used to transport the
pesticide to the site where it is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of refillable containers became widespread during the 1980's to reduce the numbers of empty pesticide containers
needing to be disposed of by farmers. In general, registrants distribute large undivided quantities of pesticides
to dealerships (refilling establishments) where the products are stored in large bulk tanks. The dealer then repackages
the pesticide from the bulk storage tanks to portable minibulk containers that generally have capacities around
100 gallons. The increased use of refillable containers led to an increased amount of herbicide stored in bulk quantities
and the need to have a secondary containment system built around the bulk storage tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the results of the survey conducted to support this rulemaking, and focussing on the 272 PAIs, EPA estimates
that 1,130 refilling establishments existed in the U.S. in 1988. This number is significantly lower than the population
estimates for these types of facilities based on all PAIs and registration data, it is also lower than the estimates
for the number of these facilities presently in existence, made by EPA in its proposed containers and containment
standards rule (40 CFR part 165, 59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994) and by estimates of members of this industry. EPA believes
this discrepancy between the 1988 and current numbers of facilities is due to the fact that repackaging into refillable
containers was still a growing market, particularly in 1988. In addition, some industry representatives indicated
that because it was so early in the creation of this market, many of the refilling establishments were unaware that
their new service of repackaging pesticide products required them to be registered establishments and to report
their annual production to the Agency. Thus, it is possible that many refilling establishments were not included
in the population from which our sample was drawn.

B. Source Reduction Review Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6604 of the PPA directs the Administrator to set up an office for the purpose, among other things, of reviewing
for the EPA Administrator the impact that Agency regulations would have on source reduction. See PPA section 6604,
42 U.S.C. 13103; S. Rep. No. 526, 101st Congress, 2nd session at 2 (1990). This office is to ``consider'' the effect
of Agency programs on source reduction efforts and to ``review'' EPA's regulations prior and subsequent to their
proposal to determine their effect on source reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Source Reduction Review Project (SRRP) is a pilot program of the U.S. EPA to demonstrate the value and feasibility
of taking a source reduction approach in designing environmental regulations. The project's goal is to ensure that
source reduction measures and cross-media implications of rules are fully considered during development of regulations.
To the extent practicable and consistent with existing law, and considering cost-effectiveness as appropriate,
the Agency will emphasize source reduction as the basis of its rules. Where source reduction cannot be implemented,
the Agency will consider recycling, then treatment and if necessary disposal technologies and practices as the basis
of its rules. Even in cases where EPA cannot base its rule on source reduction practices, the Agency may encourage the
regulated community to consider using innovative source reduction measures to comply with rules by providing information
and economic incentives. To investigate opportunities for source reduction, EPA will consider source reduction
in every phase of rule development: data collection, site visits, bench-scale technology testing, economic and
technical analysis, multi-media impacts and agency and public reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PFPR effluent guidelines regulation was one of approximately 25 rules chosen for this pilot effort. Since initial
data collection for this rule preceded the PPA, the Agency did not directly ask questions about source reduction in
the industry survey. In every phase since the survey, however, the Agency has considered and evaluated opportunities
for source reduction. In addition, the Agency has tried to coordinate this rule with efforts of the Office of Solid
Waste in developing a hazardous waste listing for carbamates, a family of pesticide active ingredients.

As will be described in greater detail in Section VII of today's notice, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Water Use and Wastewater Characteristics,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 wastewater is generated by pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in relatively small volumes
and on an intermittent basis. Furthermore, the source of virtually all wastewater is from cleaning something that
has been in contact with the pesticide product. These characteristics afford considerable opportunities for pollution
prevention and water conservation. As described in section VII of this preamble, EPA has studied and observed a number
of pollution-preventing and/or wastewater conserving practices at a wide range of pesticide formulating, packaging
or repackaging facilities. Because of the pollution prevention opportunities demonstrated by this industry, the
Agency has included this rule in the SRRP. Some of the research on wastewater treatment described in the next section
focuses on wastewater treatment that also allows for product recovery. This research was funded through the inclusion
of this rule in the SRRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SRRP designation for the PFPR effluent guidelines has prompted EPA to look more closely at what some of the likely
outcomes would be of applying the identified candidate BAT technologies. For example, the Agency has looked beyond
the usual estimation of the cost expected to be incurred by the industry to comply with this rule and the pollutants
expected to be removed from the wastewater stream. EPA also has estimated the savings that might be realized due to
the water conservation and product recovery practices that are part of the best available technology (See section
XIV, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Economic Considerations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). EPA is also attempting to track the destinations of all wastes from the formulating, packaging or repackaging industry.
Particular focus is, of course, placed on the wastewater, because it is the waste source for which there is the most
data. EPA has attempted to anticipate the ultimate destination of wastewater pollutants to consider whether the
proposed regulatory approach, and the expected action taken by the industry in response to the regulatory approach,
will truly result in net environmental benefit or will merely result in transfer of pollutants to another medium.
This will be discussed in more detail in Section XVI, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-Water Quality Considerations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that both of the SRRP-related studies (evaluating the savings and the pollutant destinations) will
help to expand EPA's knowledge of sources of waste and opportunities for real pollution prevention and savings. This
effort also points out data gaps that EPA may be able to fill during future data collection efforts. Such information
could improve EPA's ability to carry out its mission to identify and control the more significant environmental problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that source reduction and application of the Pollution Prevention Act's environmental management
hierarchy is achieved in today's proposed rulemaking through the proposal's recognition of the following:

EPA recognizes that source reduction in the context of pesticide use generally has other important components. These
include improving efficiency in pesticide production and formulating processes, improving application efficiencies,
encouraging integrated pest management and low input sustainable agricultural practices, and encouraging the
use of safer pesticides when pesticides are necessary. Currently, the Agency is pursuing efforts in these other areas,
such as the pesticide containers and containment standards proposed rule, which is intended to reduce the numbers
of pesticide containers needing disposal by setting standards and guidelines for the use of refillable containers.

The technical data gathering efforts for this rulemaking involved several activities which are summarized in this
section and in the technical Development Document for today's proposed rule. In general, EPA's data gathering efforts
were conducted by six principal means: (1) Reviewing existing information from past rulemaking records and other
Agency files pertaining to the pesticide chemicals formulating and packaging industry; (2) obtaining new information
through a questionnaire sent to a stratified random sample of the industry; (3) conducting numerous site visits to
observe pollution prevent practices; (4) implementing a wastewater sampling and analysis program; (5) implementing
bench-scale treatability studies; and (6) transferring data from the pesticide manufacturing subcategories and
other sources. These are described further below:

1. Existing Databases
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A pesticide, as defined by the FIFRA, includes ``any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing,
destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, and any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant
regulator, defoliant, or desiccant'' (40 CFR 152.3(s)). Under FIFRA, all pesticides must be registered with EPA
prior to shipment, delivery, or sale in the United States. A pesticide product is a formulated product; that is, it
is a mixture of at least one ``active ingredient'' and ``inert'' diluents. Each formulation has a distinct registration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mandatory reporting of yearly pesticide production is required by FIFRA as part of the pesticide registration process.
Pesticide producing establishments, including formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities, are required
to provide information to EPA on registered pesticide products, such as product registration numbers, product classification,
type and use, and production rates. These data are submitted as part of the ``Pesticide Report for Pesticide-Producing
Establishments'' (EPA Form 3540&hyph;16) and are stored in the FIFRA and TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) Enforcement
System (FATES) data base. (The FATES data base has been renamed the Section Seven Tracking System (SSTS).) Accessing
the FATES data base gave the population data from which the stratified random sample of formulating, packaging and
repackaging facilities were drawn. The databases for more recent years (1989 through 1991) were also accessed to
identify any changes in the make-up of the industry and to evaluate the applicability of this regulation, as will be
discussed in more detail later in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the survey of pesticide chemicals formulating, packaging or repackaging industry, the Agency focused on the
272 active ingredients or classes of active ingredients that were the basis of the census for the pesticide manufacturing
facilities. In 1988, EPA decided to separate the pesticide manufacturing rulemaking, which at that time was well
underway, from the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging rulemaking. However, as the subcategories
are all included in the same point source category and were initially intended to be developed concurrently, EPA continued
to use the same list of 272 active ingredients that formed the basis for the pesticide manufacturing data base for the
pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategories. (For the final rule covering organic pesticide
chemical manufacturing, three of the active ingredients were dropped from coverage: biphenyl since it was no longer
a registered pesticide active ingredient and ortho- and para-dichlorobenzene whose manufacture is covered by another
effluent guidelines regulation.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial basis of this list was the 284 active ingredients and classes of active ingredients presented in Appendix
2 of the October 4, 1985 regulation (50 FR 40672). These 284 active ingredients were originally selected in 1977 on
the basis of significant production and/or commercial use. EPA then expanded this list to 835 active ingredients
by adding the following group of active ingredients: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All salts and esters of listed organic acids (such as 2,4-D); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All metallo-organic active ingredients (consisting of an organic portion bonded to arsenic, cadmium, copper,
or mercury); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All organo-tin active ingredients; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All active ingredients that appeared to be structurally similar to other listed active ingredients (such
as organo-phosphorus pesticides); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any other active ingredients with an analytical method previously demonstrated to be applicable to wastewater.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA excluded from this list of 835 active ingredients those active ingredients already subject to regulation under
other effluent guidelines_specifically, those for which the manufacturing is regulated by the Organic Chemicals,
Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) (40 CFR part 414), Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (40 CFR part 415), and
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (40 CFR part 439) effluent guidelines. Information provided to EPA under FIFRA indicated
that 335 of those 835 active ingredients were produced in 1984&hyph;1985, and the other 500 were not produced for domestic
use in either 1984 or 1985. An additional 15 (of the 835) were added to the 335 active ingredients because those 15 active
ingredients had been manufactured prior to 1984 and might still be manufactured for export. The list of 350 active
ingredients and derivatives, such as salts and esters of an active ingredient, was consolidated into an active ingredient
class, to arrive at a total of 272 active ingredients and classes of active ingredients. Because the consolidated
classes include all elements of the class, such as all salts and esters of 2,4-D (i.e., not just those in use in 1986),
the 272 active ingredients and classes of active ingredients actually include 606 of the 835 specific active ingredients.
This list of active ingredients was used as a basis for the effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the pesticide
chemicals manufacturing subcategories (58 FR 50367).

2. Survey Questionnaire
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major source of information and data used in developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards is industry
responses to questionnaires distributed by EPA under the authority of section 308 of the Clean Water Act. These questionnaires
typically request information concerning the generation of wastewater and pollutants as part of production processes,
treatment, and disposal, as well as wastewater treatment system performance data. Questionnaires also request
financial and economic data for use in assessing economic impacts and the economic achievability of technology options.
In 1988 EPA submitted a draft questionnaire to pesticide industry trade associations, environmental public interest
groups and a number of pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities for review and comment. EPA subsequently
revised the draft questionnaire and in 1989 distributed it to nine facilities for a pretest. Further revisions were
made to the form following the pretest, and it was then submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review pursuant
to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB cleared the questionnaire on January 30, 1990 (OMB control number 2040&hyph;0139). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FATES data files were accessed to obtain information on product registrations containing one or more of the 272 targeted
PAIs. This dataset was used to define a sampling frame of 3,241 facilities identified in the 1988 Fates database as
formulators, packagers, or repackagers of these PAIs. The sampling frame was partitioned into 51 strata. The stratification
was done according to pesticide production amount (large, medium, small, and tiny) and pesticide type (fungicide,
herbicide, insecticide, and other and combinations of these types for facilities that formulate and/or package
more than one type). A total of 611 facilities was selected randomly from the sampling frame to comprise the questionnaire
survey sample. The survey was also distributed to a census of 91 pesticide manufacturers that also formulate, package
or repackage pesticides which were identified from the ``Pesticide Manufacturing Facility Census for 1986''. Two
of the 611 sampled facilities and two of the 91 manufacturers were sampled twice and received duplicate surveys so
the actual number of facilities sent surveys was 609 sampled facilities and 89 manufacturers for a total of 698 surveyed
facilities. EPA received responses from 676 (587 randomly sampled facilities and 89 manufacturers) of the 698 facilities
that received the questionnaire (a 97 percent response rate). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 676 facilities that responded to the survey, 349 indicated that they were formulating, packaging or repackaging
pesticide products in 1988 and 203 were refilling establishments. One hundred nineteen (119) facilities did not
formulate and package pesticide products in 1988. Of the remaining 5 facilities that were sent questionnaires, 3
had gone out of business, one was released from completing a questionnaire and one sampled facility merged with a second
sampled facility. A small number of facilities (22) did not submit questionnaires. EPA believes most of these facilities
are refilling establishments by virtue of their stratum, the company name and their locations. Since the survey had
drawn significant numbers of refilling establishments, EPA did not further pursue these questionnaires. Based
on the responses to the surveys from the randomly sampled facilities and the census of manufacturers, quantitative
estimates of pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging activities were computed for the entire U.S. population
of such facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received questionnaires from six facilities that were not selected in the random sample part of the census
of manufacturers. Three of these facilities had participated in a pretest of the questionnaire but were not chosen
in the sample. The remaining three were facilities that asked if they might submit voluntary surveys. The responses
to these questionnaires were reviewed but for statistical reasons were omitted from any further analysis for the
purpose of national population estimates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The questionnaire was divided into four sections. An introductory section asked for information on the facility
as a whole and whether it was involved in formulating, packaging or repackaging any of the 272 active ingredients in
1988. If the facility did not formulate, package or repackage pesticide products containing any of the 272 active
ingredients then no further information was required. If the facility did formulate, package or repackage pesticide
products containing the 272 active ingredients in 1988, then questions were asked regarding water use. If the facility
used no water in their process and thus, the response to all water use questions were negative, then a minimal of additional
financial information was requested and no further information was required. Facilities were also excused from
responding to the other sections of the questionnaire if 1988 was the last year that they formulated, packaged or repackaged
pesticide products containing the 272 active ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining sections were as follows: (1) A technical section which requested details on production and water use
practices, volumes, and disposition, and wastewater treatment and characteristics; (2) an economic section that
asked for detailed information on assets, debts, costs and revenues on the facility level as well as firm level data;
and (3) the last section of the questionnaire that requested the names of contacts should EPA need to follow-up on the
data provided and that requested a certification that the information was accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also requested that pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities submit wastewater self-monitoring
data. Fifty facilities submitted some form of self-monitoring data. Six facilities submitted data only for conventional
pollutants, while ten of the 50 facilities submitted priority pollutant and/or nonconventional pollutant data
(including the active ingredients). However, most of these data were not useful in characterizing pesticide process
wastewaters. In many cases, only one detection was reported for a specific pollutant, or the sampling locations represented
commingled wastewaters containing pollutant discharges from other industrial processes, such as pesticide manufacturing,
organic chemical manufacturing or formulating, packaging or repackaging other products including pesticide products
containing active ingredients not included in the list of 272 active ingredients. Often the data represented sampling
results only at the end-of-pipe plant discharge. Self-monitoring data from only 10 facilities included priority
pollutant discharges in raw pesticide process wastewaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questionnaire was mailed to a stratified random sample of U.S. pesticide formulating and packaging facilities
with stratification done according to pesticide production amount (large, medium, small, and tiny) and pesticide
type (fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, other and combinations of these types for facilities that formulate and/or
package more than one type). The survey was also distributed to a census of pesticide manufacturers that also formulate,
package or repackage pesticides. Based on sample results from the survey, quantitative estimates of pesticide formulating,
packaging or repackaging activities were computed for the entire U.S. population of such facilities. The results
of these computations will be referred to as national stratified estimates. The national stratified estimates generated,
include point estimates of totals, means (i.e., averages) and medians (i.e., the point at which an equal number of
responses are above and below the value) and their associated standard errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1988 survey, the facilities were originally classified into strata based on each facility's projected 1989
pesticide product type and 1989 projected production volume, and not based on actual reported 1988 product types
and production volume, as intended. As such, the sample facilities were selected at random from strata based on 1989
projected production characteristics when the ultimate goal was to report production characteristics for strata
based on 1988 production levels and product types. In statistical terms, some of the facilities classified using
the original scheme were misclassified under the derived scheme for stratification based on 1988 production only
(e.g., a facility classified as ``large'' based on its estimated 1989 production level might instead be classified
as ``medium'' when the 1988 production level is used). Because of instances of misclassification the sample had to
be post-stratified into correct 1988 based strata. Also, the typical formulas used to generate national estimates
of totals and standard errors of these totals are not wholly correct. Instead alternate formulas have been used based
on methods for estimating totals on subpopulations as described in Sampling Techniques, 3rd Edition by Cochran (1977,
p. 143&hyph;144). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, misclassification of members in the final strata can impact the estimated standard error. Most often,
a larger variance will be estimated than what would be obtained using the typical formulas for stratified random samples.
However, for the pesticides survey data, the degree of misclassification is small enough that a large change in the
estimated standard errors was not expected. To test this expectation, one would ideally rechoose sample facilities
based on the actual 1988 production-levels and product type and re-estimate standard errors using the typical formulas
for a stratified random sample with no misclassification. Since that is not feasible, a reasonable comparison can
still be made by examining the standard errors obtained by applying the usual formulas to the original stratification
scheme based on 1989 projected production levels. Because the same algorithm would be used for selecting the number
of facilities within each stratum, regardless of the stratification scheme employed, it can be assumed that the estimated
standard errors from the original stratification will be representative of the results that would have been computed
had the actual 1988 production characteristics been used to stratify the target population initially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comparison of the estimates for selected survey questions, including the distribution of facility revenues and
the distribution of facilities ownership and operation type, indicates that, as expected, the estimated standard
errors on the national totals are generally larger after using Cochran's formulas to account for the misclassification
than those computed assuming no misclassification. The magnitude of the differences was quite small (usually no
more than one or two percent) for the standard errors on the overall totals, but was in a few cases 20 percent or more for
very small strata. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though restratification of the survey facilities often increases the estimated standard errors, the national totals
themselves will be exactly the same mathematically, as long as the same set of facilities is used to compute the estimates.
In the PFPR project, a small number of the facilities which were included in the sample because of projected 1989 production
figures did not have any actual production in 1988. These facilities were therefore not a part of the targeted facility
universe and so were excluded from the restratified calculations. Even so, the overall national totals showed very
minor changes (on the order of at most four to five percent) when the restratified estimates were compared with totals
based on the original stratification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, a number of facilities sent questionnaires and included in the original sample did not respond to the
survey and hence were missing from the database. If these facilities had been known to be actual PFPR operations, it
might have been possible to impute data for the survey items of interest. However, since many facilities in the sample
indicated that they were not PFPR operations, it is possible that at least some of the non-respondents were also not
PFPR operations, and hence not part of the target population. In this case imputations for these facilities would
have little meaning. Those facilities that did not respond to the questionnaire were therefore omitted from any further
statistical analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because some facilities failed to answer all the survey questions, data were imputed for missing responses. The amount
of missing data was negligible in most instances. The only case where a significant amount of data was imputed involved
wastewater volumes and production-normalized wastewater volumes, which were reported on a line-by-line basis
for each combination of wastewater source and destination. Approximately 10% of the volume and/or production-normalized
volume entries were missing and subsequently imputed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The imputation strategy utilized provides an unbiased estimate of the total for any given variable, when used in conjunction
with the formulae described above for national stratified estimates in the context of misclassified strata.

3. Site Visits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to develop effluent guidelines for this industry, EPA conducted site visits and sampling at a number of pesticide
formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities, and at pesticide manufacturing facilities which also are used
as formulating and packaging facilities. Typically, during guidelines development, EPA depends on a wastewater
sampling program to characterize the raw wastewater and to establish which treatment systems operate at BAT and NSPS
levels. In the case of the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry, EPA could not conduct a sampling
program as extensive as had been conducted for some of the previous effluent guidelines rulemakings. This is because:
(1) Only 12 facilities surveyed reported operating on-site treatment systems that treated only PFP water (out of
those 12 facilities one was a voluntary participant; not part of the sample); (2) facility operating schedules are
very unpredictable due to the batch nature of their operations and just-in-time production philosophy; and (3) due
to the batch nature of the formulating and packaging processes, treatment is almost always operated on a batch basis
making it very difficult to characterize long-term treatment performance (long-term even for a 3-day period). Therefore,
EPA had to implement a more widespread and in-depth site visiting program than usual. Between 1991 and 1993, EPA visited
51 facilities (2 of these facilities are not survey or pretested facilities and, therefore, did not fill out a questionnaire)
and collected wastewater samples from 13 facilities (one facility was sampled during two different production periods
for a total of 14 sampling episodes). The site visits were conducted to provide EPA with an in-depth look at actual formulating,
packaging or repackaging operations and wastewater generation and wastewater handling practices.

4. Wastewater Sampling and Analytical Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven of the 14 pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging sampling episodes included sampling of wastewater
treatment systems and all 14 included sampling for raw wastewater characterization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raw wastewater characterization data were collected to provide EPA with concentration data for pesticide formulating,
packaging or repackaging wastewaters for a number of different wastewater sources. EPA collected 72 raw wastewater
samples which contained 45 different active ingredients at 14 different episodes. Wastewater samples were collected
for the following wastewater sources: equipment interior cleaning, exterior equipment/floor wash, air or odor
control scrubber water, DOT aerosol test bath, drum or other raw material container rinsate, laboratory equipment
cleaning water, laundry and showers. A number of these samples were collected to characterize wastewater that was
intended for reuse (the concentration of active ingredients in these samples is expected to be high). Samples of commingled
raw wastewater sources were also collected. Raw wastewater samples are typically analyzed for levels of conventional
pollutants, non-conventional pollutants (including active ingredients), metals, semi-volatile and volatile
organics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities were selected for sampling of treatment systems after an evaluation of existing data and responses to
the questionnaires and follow-up telephone conversations. Facilities were selected for sampling if: (1) The facilities
were operating an apparently effective wastewater treatment system (especially if the water treated was intended
for reuse); (2) the treatment system was used to treat pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater
only; (3) the treatment system was similar to a system EPA was evaluating in a treatability study (the facility treatment
system could then be used as a benchmark); (4) the expected active ingredients could be analyzed using developed analytical
methods; and/or (5) the facility was treating wastewater that contained active ingredients (or structural groups)
for which data was lacking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned above, sampling of wastewater treatment systems occurred for 7 of the 14 sampling episodes. The treatment
technologies that were sampled to test treatment performance include: Activated carbon adsorption, membrane filtration
(ultrafiltration and cross-flow filtration), ozonation, clarification and biological oxidation. EPA analyzed
the levels of pollutants in the raw and effluent streams and the overall performance of the treatment systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever possible, prior to a sampling episode at a pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facility, representatives
from the Agency conducted an engineering site visit. Following the visit, a draft sampling plan was prepared which
provided the rationale for the selection of sampling location as well as the procedures to be followed during sampling.
A copy of this draft plan was provided to the plant for comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the sampling episode, teams of EPA engineers and EPA contractor engineers and technicians collected and preserved
samples and shipped them to EPA contract laboratories for analysis. Levels of conventional pollutants, non-conventional
pollutants (including the pesticide active ingredients), and priority pollutants were measured in raw wastewater
and treated effluent. EPA always offered to split the samples with the facility so that the facility could have an independent
analysis of pollutant concentrations made. When facilities chose to split samples with EPA, either the facility
accepted the split samples provided by the EPA or plant personnel independently collected wastewater from the EPA
sampling sites. Following the sampling episode, a draft trip report was prepared that included descriptions of the
pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging operations and treatment processes, sampling procedures, analytical
results, quality assurance/quality control evaluation, and discussion of the raw wastewater composition and treatment
system performance. The report was provided to the sampled facility for review and comment, and any corrections were
incorporated into the report. The facilities also identified any information in the draft report that the facility
considered confidential business information.

5. EPA Bench-Scale Treatability Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA performed several treatability tests with various treatment technologies on various pesticide active ingredient
pollutants and also a variety of pesticide manufacturing and formulating, packaging, and repackaging process wastewaters.
The purpose of these studies was to expand the treatability information available on various active ingredients
to verify given technologies' effectiveness on pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging wastewater
matrices and to evaluate the ability of some technologies to allow for recovery of product. In addition, EPA is relying
in this rulemaking on various treatability studies done in conjunction with the development of the recent pesticide
manufacturers rulemaking. EPA also studied the performance of a treatment system that will be referred to as the ``Universal
Treatment System'' for pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging wastewater (described below), and studied
the performance of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis separately due to their use in recovering wastes. EPA also
performed a treatability study on the pyrethrin active ingredients, testing both hydrolysis rates and carbon isotherms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Universal Treatment System treatability study was done because EPA had no performance data on this complete system
of control technologies for treating pesticide active ingredients. Although EPA has considerable data from the
pesticide manufacturing rulemaking to demonstrate that the individual treatment technologies are effective at
removing specific active ingredients from wastewater, the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater
may have a more complex matrix (as compared to manufacturing wastewater) because of emulsifiers and surfactants
and thus these individual treatments might not be as effective absent pretreatment to remove the emulsifiers/surfactants.
There are some pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that do pretreat their wastewater to
remove surfactants and emulsifiers prior to treatment by activated carbon. However, these facilities may not be
using the most effective physical/chemical technology for removing the active ingredient in their wastewaters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bench-scale test results using a wastewater generated by a facility which formulates and packages products containing
Bromacil, Tebuthiuron, Diuron, Terbufos and Benthiocarb indicate that the concentrations of these active ingredients
can be reduced to levels below the analytical limit of detection. The technologies tested on this wastewater were
chemical assisted separation (emulsion breaking), ozone/ultraviolet light oxidation and activated carbon adsorption.
The emulsion breaking step removed turbidity, a major portion of the oil and grease and some total organic carbon (TOC).
The rate of oxidation of the active ingredients appears to be a function of the concentration of other oxidizable organics
contained in the wastewater. In this case, oxidation converted a portion of the soluble organics into insoluble precipitates,
thus requiring a second clarification step prior to activated carbon treatment. Carbon isotherm and carbon adsorption
column tests indicate that oxidation generates short chained organic acids and alcohols which are poorly adsorbed
on carbon, resulting in a large TOC concentration in the effluent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second facility generated cleaning wastewater which contained an alkali soap and followed a cleaning with isopropyl
alcohol. The active ingredients present in the wastewater included Piperonyl Butoxide, Propoxur, Allethrin, Tetramethrin
and Permethrin. The study indicates that emulsion breaking using ferric chloride and a polyelectrolyte removes
the majority of Allethrin, Permethrin, oil and grease and turbidity. This would indicate that the Allethrin and Permethrin
are more soluble in the organic or oil fraction and thus are removed in conjunction with the removal of the oil and grease
or organic fraction. Alkaline hydrolysis at pH 12 and 60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C followed by carbon adsorption decreased the concentrations of Allethrin and Permethrin to below the analytical
limit of detection. Carbon adsorption effluent contained approximately 800 mg/L of TOC of which nearly 60 percent
was derived from isopropyl alcohol.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also conducted a study of ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane separations technologies.
This study tested the effectiveness of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis to obtain a clean, reusable water stream
and to generate a concentrate that could be recovered for its product value. Membrane separation processes utilize
a pressure driven, semi-permeable membrane to achieve selective separations. The pore size of the membrane can be
relatively large if precipitates or suspended materials are to be removed from a wastewater, or very small for removal
of inorganic salts or organic molecules. During operation, the feed solution flows across the surface of the membrane.
Water permeates the membrane, and the contaminants remain in the now more concentrated feed solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An earlier study had shown that reverse osmosis treatment alone was not effective for formulating and packaging wastewater.
This was attributed to the presence of emulsifiers and surfactants that are formulation components that subsequently
contaminated the wastewater. The surfactants or emulsifiers with a somewhat higher molecular weight than the other
components were not only retained by the RO membrane, but also caused fouling and gumming of the membrane, which reduced
its effectiveness. Therefore, the EPA studied a treatment train consisting of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis.
The ultrafiltration was added to remove larger molecular constituents such as the emulsifiers and surfactants from
the wastewater. A major advantage of the process is that not only can a high quality product water stream (permeate)
be produced, the membrane-rejected material can potentially be recycled back into the formulating and packaging
process, substantially reducing the amount of material requiring disposal. The concentrates from both the UF and
the RO units were evaluated for recoverability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bench-scale tests using wastewaters from two PFPR facilities were tested using UF followed by RO. Also, jar tests
were performed to evaluate alternative physical/chemical methods of pretreating the wastewater before RO treatment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two separate systems were used for the ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis tests. The bench-scale systems were designed
to use commercially available ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis equipment, while keeping the size of the systems
as small as possible. This design approach was selected to provide results representative of a full-scale system,
while minimizing the amount of wastewater which had to be collected, shipped, and ultimately disposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the UF/RO study show this treatment sequence was effective in removing the nine active ingredients
present in the wastewaters taken from the two PFPR facilities. Ultrafiltration pretreatment prevented rapid fouling
of the RO membrane. For all but one of nine active ingredients (2, 4&hyph;D, Dicamba, MCPP, Prometon, Bromacil, Benthiocarb,
Diuron, Terbufos, and Tebuthiuron) better than 99% removal was accomplished by the treatment sequence. Data for
Bromacil indicate it was reduced by 89.3%; however, this percent removal may misrepresent the treatment performance
because there is some indication the measurement of Bromacil in the untreated wastewater was affected by analytical
interference and thus could have been present at a higher concentration that was measured. The UF/RO treatment sequence
appears to be a very effective alternative to the Universal Treatment System, at least for high molecular weight active
ingredients, to achieve a treated water that can be reused in the facility. It is less clear whether the concentrated
waste created by either of these treatment steps can be recovered for its product value. The samples taken from the
concentrate fraction show high concentrations of the active ingredients, however, there are also high concentrations
of sodium, calcium and total dissolved solids which could prevent the recoverability of these wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third treatability study was performed to support rulemaking for both the PFPR and pesticide manufacturing. This
study examined wastewater containing pyrethrins to determine their treatability by hydrolysis and activated carbon.
Wastewater collected from a pyrethrin manufacturer was tested under varying hydrolysis conditions of temperature
and pH. Carbon isotherms were also developed for this wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combined pyrethrins concentration in the untreated wastewater was initially 110 mg/L. Hydrolysis tests performed
at 60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C and pH values of 2 and 12 were used to determine the hydrolysis rates (half-life values) of the pyrethrins. Pyrethrins
hydrolyzed rapidly at pH 12, exhibiting a half-life of 1.2 hours. Pyrethrins hydrolyses at pH 2 were much slower, with
a calculated half-life of 77 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six carbon dosages were also tested to determine adsorption characteristics of pyrethrins. At a 10 gallon per minute
flow rate, the carbon column would have a service life of 11.4 days for combined pyrethrins at 110 mg/L initial concentration
indicating that pyrethrins are adsorbed.

6. Data Transfers From Pesticide Manufacturing Subcategories and Other Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has developed an active ingredient treatability dataset, based on full-scale treatment system data,
treatability study information, and data transfers, that show that all of the 272 active ingredients included in
the survey are amenable to one or more of the treatment technologies that are included in the Universal Treatment System,
which EPA is identifying as BAT for purposes of today's proposed pretreatment standards for existing sources (see
PSES discussion below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA transferred the treatability data from the following sources, listed in order of preference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Pesticides manufacturing active ingredient or active ingredient group BAT limitations development data. The
data are transferred from the manufacturing data base to support BAT limitations if the treatment is based on activated
carbon adsorption, chemical oxidation, hydrolysis, a combination of these technologies, or precipitation of organo-metallic
active ingredients or active ingredient groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA bench-scale treatability study reports.

(3) EPA sampling episode reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(4) Industry treatability study reports, literature articles, and other data sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For some active ingredients, a different treatment technology, such as resin adsorption or solvent extraction,
may have served as the basis for manufacturers' limitation because it was in use at a given facility and judged to represent
BAT performance based on monitoring data. In some cases, a PFPR facility may want to use these types of technologies,
rather than the Universal Treatment System, if the facility is only handling an active ingredient that requires that
technology. The wastewater matrix at PFPR facilities, however, may be more complex than the manufacturer's wastewater
containing the same active ingredient because of emulsifiers and surfactants, and the treatment technology identified
as Best Available Technology for the manufacturers' limitation may not be capable of achieving the removal levels
specified in the manufacturers rule without substantial pretreatment. In addition, for most PFPR facilities, the
commingled wastewater will contain multiple active ingredients, all of which will be amenable to the more common
treatment technologies comprising the Universal Treatment System. Furthermore, a treatment system relying on
a technology such as solvent extraction to remove an active ingredient would still require activated carbon polishing
to adsorb other wastewater constituents, including residual extraction solvent, before the treated wastewater
could be reused. Rather than attempting to integrate these other technologies of resin adsorption, solvent extraction
or others into a centralized wastewater treatment scheme, EPA believes that the Universal Treatment System offers
a more consistent, simplistic, and cost-effective design and thus constitutes BAT treatment at PFPR facilities
(together with recycle/reuse of the treated wastewaters, as described below). The technologies included in the
Universal Treatment System, together with pretreatment for emulsifiers/surfactants where needed, are capable
of removing all toxic pollutants that may be in PFP wastewaters to levels that will allow recycle or reuse of the wastewaters
at the facility. Thus, these BAT technologies support the zero discharge requirements proposed in today's notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, EPA developed a treatability dataset for the 272 active ingredients in order to ensure that the Universal
Treatment System technologies will be effective in providing treated effluent suitable for reuse. EPA evaluated
full-scale and bench-scale treatability data available for the 272 active ingredients, including those where a
different technology basis was used to support the manufacturers' limitation. The Agency also developed technical
treatability data transfer methodologies for the transfer of activated carbon adsorption and hydrolysis treatability
data between structurally-similar active ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transfers of treatability data are based on an analysis of properties of active ingredients and active ingredient
groups, such as chemical structure, molecular weight, aromaticity, and solubility. If, based on this analysis,
an active ingredient is considered amenable to hydrolysis or carbon adsorption but lacks treatability data, then
treatability data are transferred to this active ingredient from a structurally-similar active ingredients with
either hydrolysis or carbon adsorption treatability data. If multiple treatability data exist for structurally-similar
active ingredients, then the most conservative data are transferred. If no data exist for structurally-similar
active ingredients, and if the active ingredient is expected to be amenable to hydrolysis or carbon adsorption based
on its structure, solubility, or molecular weight, then conservative treatability data, determined from all active
ingredients with hydrolysis or carbon adsorption treatability data, are transferred to the active ingredient.

In determining the efficacy of the treatment technologies in the Universal Treatment System to the active ingredients
in PFPR facility wastewater, EPA also factored in the need for pretreatment steps. PFPR facility wastewater may contain
emulsifiers, surfactants, solids, organic constituents in addition to the active ingredients, and other pollutants
that may interfere with active ingredient removals across the treatment technologies. The Agency examined existing
PFPR facility treatment systems and vendor-supplied treatment systems designed to be applicable at all PFPR facilities.
The Agency's identification of Best Available Technology includes the Universal Treatment System treatment technologies
including emulsion breaking, oil layer removal and off-site disposal as a hazardous waste, solids separation and
removal, and removal of any remaining large particles by in-line strainers prior to activated carbon adsorption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final effluent from the Universal Treatment System is expected to be suitable for reuse, e.g., as general pesticide
production area cleanup water. Based on the active ingredient treatability dataset and information from PFPR facilities
that treat and reuse pesticide process wastewater, the Agency believes that the identified of Best Available Technology
is applicable to all PFPR Subcategory C facilities.

EPA divided the pesticide chemicals point source category into three subcategories in the 1978 BPT rulemaking. These
three subcategories are the organic pesticide chemicals subcategory, which applies to the manufacture of organic
pesticide active ingredients; the metallo-organic pesticide chemicals subcategory, which applies to the manufacture
of metallo-organic pesticide active ingredients; and the pesticide chemicals formulating and packaging subcategory
which applies to the formulating and packaging of all pesticide products. In addition, the regulations include Test
Methods for Pesticide Pollutants at 40 CFR part 455, subpart D (58 FR 50637, September 28, 1993).

B. Development of Current Subcategorization Scheme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's proposal EPA does not address the organic pesticide chemicals and metallo-organic pesticide chemicals
subcategories because they were the subject of the recent rulemaking covering pesticide manufacturing (58 FR 50637).
Today's notice proposes to retain the pesticide chemicals formulating and packaging subcategory (subpart C) and
to create a new subcategory: repackaging performed at refilling establishments (subpart E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered the factors that can most affect the decisions on subcategorization: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;product type; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;raw materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;plant size; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;plant location; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;non-water quality characteristics; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;treatment costs and energy requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has surveyed and visited facilities with a variety of product types and has not seen evidence of differences in
water use based on product type. Therefore, EPA does not consider this factor to be a basis on which to subcategorize.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The raw material of refilling establishments is the registered pesticide product, which is simply transferred from
one refillable container (a stationary bulk tank) to another refillable container (a minibulk tank). The raw materials
for the formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities are active ingredients and inert ingredients which take
all physical forms and require formulating and packaging to result in the registered product. Thus, raw materials
are a contributing factor in subcategorizing this industry. In addition, the type of operation performed at refilling
establishments, repackaging only, is considerably different from the operations performed at formulating, packaging
and repackaging facilities. Thus, the type of operation also contributes to the subcategorization of this industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no great differences in the sources from which wastewater is generated, virtually all wastewater is derived
from cleaning equipment and surrounding areas. However, there are differences in the volumes of wastewater generated
by facilities. The median annual volume of PFPR wastewater generated by manufacturing/PFPR facilities is 179,330
gallons, the median annual volume generated by PFPR only facilities is 2,223 gallons and the median annual volume
generated by refilling establishments is 736 gallons. Although these differences are substantial, they alone might
not justify subcategorization. They do, however, affect the costs of wastewater treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PFPR facilities do not necessarily have a dominant product although most serve one predominant market. EPA considered
the effect that market differences could have within the PFPR subcategory as described in the next section. The refilling
establishments are very homogeneous in that they serve only one market, the agricultural market, and the products
they repackage are mostly liquid bulk herbicides. Thus, the dominant product is a factor in subcategorizing this
industry to the extent that the refillers have a dominant product and the PFPR facilities do not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Climatic conditions which are related to location could have an effect on water use and water conservation practices.
At the time of the industry survey, California was experiencing a severe drought. EPA noticed that the lack of and cost
of water in this part of the country encouraged many innovative pollution prevention and reuse techniques at those
facilities. However, many of these same techniques have been implemented in areas of net precipitation, thus the
climatic conditions related to geographic location are not a factor in subcategorizing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are some distinct differences in the location of facilities. Whereas most refilling establishments are either
in rural locations or in small towns near agricultural areas, many of the PFPR facilities are located in urban areas.
In particular the PFPR facilities that serve the industrial and institutional/commercial markets are located in
urban areas. The Agency is unsure whether this is due to the fact that the type of business these facilities are engaged
in and the markets that they serve result in their urban location, thus providing them with access to POTWs, or that
all facilities that were more rural in their location and also direct discharges either discontinued production
or relocated and switched to becoming dischargers to POTW's in response to the BPT limitations requiring the elimination
of dischargers directly to receiving waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment costs and best available wastewater treatment technology are a significant factor in considering whether
to subcategorize PFPR facilities and refilling establishments. As described more fully in the discussion of the
regulatory approach, wastewaters generated at refilling establishments are expected to be recycled/reused without
treatment. EPA has estimated the cost of holding the wastewater until it can be recycled/reused. As previously mentioned,
the refilling establishments generate a median of 736 gallons annually. These wastewaters are expected to be collected
in the containment system and loading areas, whereafter they can be pumped into and held in a tank or container. The
few refilling facilities that are estimated to discharge wastewater were discharging a total estimate volume of
1500 gallons annually to POTW's. This represents an average volume of approximately 78 gallons per facility which
can be held in a single minibulk container, which costs about $200&hyph;$300. The PFPR facilities (other than refilling
establishments) are also expected to be able to recycle/reuse wastewaters, however some wastewater sources may
require treatment before they can be recycled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has estimated the costs for storage of wastewater and treatment through the Universal Treatment System. The average
estimated cost of compliance for PFPR facilities is approximately $32,300 annually. Based on this higher cost between
the two basic types of facilities and the different operations, separate economic analyses were conducted. These
analyses showed that refilling establishments and most types of PFPR facilities can achieve the zero discharge limitations
economically. However, EPA's analysis of economic impacts for PFPR facilities indicate that a small segment, sanitizer
facilities, will incur much greater costs and economic impacts from complying with the zero discharge limitations
than the other facilities would incur. The Agency considered creating a separate subcategory for sanitizer facilities,
but sanitizer facilities are very similar to other PFPR facilities in other respects. Since the data indicate that
the economic impacts can be reduced and the amount of discharge is small for indirect discharging sanitizer facilities,
EPA decided not to form a separate subcategory but simply to provide separate pretreatment standards for sanitizer
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, there are clear differences between refilling establishments and PFPR facilities. They differ
in the raw materials, water use, location, wastewater treatment requirements and costs. Therefore, EPA proposes
to establish a separate subcategory that will apply to refilling establishments. However, following review of comments
on this proposal, the final rule may incorporate the refilling establishments into the PFPR subcategory, provided
the limitations are the same.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussions of EPA's subcategories reflects the analysis done with the survey data representing the
formulating, packaging and repackaging practices for the 272 active ingredients that were the subject of that survey.
EPA believes that the formulating, packaging and repackaging practices for the rest of the active ingredients will
be the same as for the 272, however, the data presented in the following discussion does not reflect their inclusion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subcategory applies to the formulating, packaging and repackaging of pesticide chemicals. BPT regulations
already exist for this subcategory. EPA proposes to add the word ``repackaging'' to the title and applicability provision
of this subcategory, but these do not represent changes to the applicability or coverage of this subcategory. Repackaging
is proposed to be defined as ``the direct transference of a single pesticide active ingredient or single formulation
from any marketable container to another marketable container, without intentionally mixing in any inerts, diluents,
solvents, other active ingredients, or other materials of any sort.'' The term ``packaging'' in the applicability
provision of Subpart C was always intended to cover repackaging as well as packaging operations. Facilities engaged
in repackaging pesticide products must comply with the same reporting requirements under FIFRA as formulating and
packaging facilities. In addition, repackaging frequently generates wastewater sources similar in nature to formulating
and packaging activities. Thus, repackaging activities are within the scope of Subcategory C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist EPA with its evaluation of the PFPR facilities, EPA divided the industry into subgroups. This analysis of
subgroups was also performed to evaluate whether there was a need to further subcategorize the industry based on these
subgroups. These subgroups were developed primarily from the information in the questionnaires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subgroups were analyzed to determine if there are trends in water usage, water discharge or disposal methods,
and production associated with particular markets or products. EPA identified facilities within the subgroups
that are currently achieving zero discharge through recycle or reuse of wastewater and facilities that are not achieving
zero discharge. This information was used to coordinate additional data gathering activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA created ten subgroups defined as: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each facility was put into only one subgroup. If a facility's products or markets were not predominantly in one subgroup
the facility was placed in the ``other'' subgroup. EPA chose this approach to evaluate the factors of market type,
physical properties of an active ingredient or active ingredient group, or formulation type which, aside from the
treatment requirements for a given active ingredient, were believed to have the greatest effect on the generation
of wastewater and therefore treatment needs. The Agency split one market type: ``home, lawn and garden'' into two
subgroups because facilities producing products to be used inside the home such as insecticides controlling roaches
would likely be formulating, packaging or repackaging their products throughout the year, whereas the facilities
that formulate, package or repackage pesticides for the lawn or garden would likely have a seasonal production schedule.
These different production schedules can affect wastewater treatment requirements and the ability to recycle or
reuse wastewater. Similarly, all facilities that reported having a DOT test bath were grouped together because this
source of significant volumes of wastewater affects wastewater treatment requirements and the ability to recycle
and reuse wastewater. Manufacturers were separated from other pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging
facilities because they are chemical manufacturers and tend to be large facilities with existing wastewater treatment
systems. Although their formulating, packaging or repackaging operations are not different from other facilities,
the scale at which they produce pesticide products and the volumes of wastewater generated and current wastewater
disposal practices are different. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subgroup analysis did not reveal substantive differences in the water usage or production processes within any
subgroup, thus EPA does not believe there is any need for further subcategorization of this subcategory. However,
the economic impact analysis indicates that facilities which formulate, package or repackage sanitizer chemicals
would be impacted by the costs of the various technology options. Sanitizers chemicals are proposed to be defined
as products containing one or more of the active ingredients listed on Table 8 of the regulation. EPA has segmented
the sanitizer facilities for the purposes of establishing PSES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities in the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging industry typically conduct more than one type
of operation to produce pesticide products. The industry generally comprises facilities that either formulate
and package pesticide products (68 percent), or facilities that formulate, package and repackage pesticide products
(22 percent). A small group of facilities perform other combinations of these operations (e.g., package and repackage
only). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest concentration of PFPR facilities, 45 percent of the facilities are located in EPA Regions IV and V, the
southeast and midwest portions of the country. However, PFPR facilities can be found in every geographic region of
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities were requested to report the percentage breakdown of their 1988 pesticide formulating, packaging and
repackaging revenues by market type. Revenues coming from the agricultural market constituted the largest percentage,
approximately 65 percent of the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging revenues.

Products that are formulated, packaged or repackaged contain various percentages of one or more of the 272 active
ingredients considered in the survey for this regulation by EPA. Some products may contain less than one percent of
active ingredient by weight, while others may contain over 95 percent of active ingredient by weight. The five active
ingredients that had the highest estimated use in products that were formulated, packaged or repackaged are listed

&bull;Atrazine is a herbicide used to control various weeds mainly on corn and sorghum crops. An estimated 278 million
pounds of atrazine were used in products formulated, packaged or repackaged by water-using pesticide formulating,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Alachlor is used as a preemergence herbicide to control certain grasses and weeds in a variety of crops such

Production lines range from complex configurations involving numerous formulating and packaging steps to simpler
lines that transfer product from storage to a marketable container. Typically, facilities that formulate and package
products operate lines that include one or more storage tanks, one or more formulating processes such as mixing, blending,
grinding, milling and filtering, and a final packaging process. Facilities in Subcategory C that solely package
products typically transfer a product from a storage tank into a marketable container, and facilities that solely
repackage products transfer product from one marketable container into another marketable container. Facilities
that merely relabel a product's container are not under the scope of today's notice. The average market value of a production
line is estimated to be $216,000 and the median value is estimated to be $10,000. The gap in magnitude between average
and median is representative of the fact that most of the facilities attach a relatively modest market value (half
estimates a value less than $10,000) while a relatively few facilities attach very high market value to their production
lines bringing the average up to $216,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of products formulated, packaged or repackaged on each line varies from line to line and from facility to
facility. Some lines are dedicated to one product while others may handle ten or more. Certain lines produce a variety
of pesticide products that contain the same or a similar pesticide active ingredient, while other lines produce pesticides
that contain a variety of different active ingredients. Some lines are also used to formulate, package or repackage
products that have different formulation types.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questionnaire requested facilities to specify those months each pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging
line was in operation in 1988, and to estimate the total number of days and hours each line was in operation in 1988. Most
lines (66%) are operated 80 days or less in the production of registered products that contain one of the 272 active
ingredients covered by the survey. A high proportion (28%) of lines are estimated to be in operation 10 days or less
per year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subcategory applies to repackaging of agricultural pesticide products done by refilling establishments whose
principal business is retail sales, for the purpose of this preamble these facilities will be referred to as refilling
establishments. The term refilling establishment is defined by the proposed 40 CFR part 165 rule as an establishment
where the activity of repackaging pesticide product into refillable containers occurs, and encompasses a broader
universe of facilities than the previous description and than this proposal will apply. When it became apparent that
refilling establishments are so numerous, and among themselves very similar but very different from the formulating,
packaging and repackaging facilities, EPA decided to segregate refilling establishments into a separate subcategory.
The distinction of refilling establishments from repackaging activities is that refilling establishments use
a refillable container as the receptacle of the repackaged product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Refilling establishments perform a single operation that is covered by today's notice: repackaging agricultural
pesticide product. As a group, refilling establishments are very similar to one another. They differ from pesticide
formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in the following ways: (1) Locations_refilling establishments
of agricultural pesticides are mostly in rural areas or small towns while formulating, packaging or repackaging
facilities are frequently urban; (2) SIC codes_refilling establishments are in 5191, which characterizes establishments
as ``primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of animal feeds, fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, pesticides,
seeds and other farm supplies except grains'', whereas PFPR facilities reported being classified in SIC code 2879;
and (3) customers_refilling establishments are retail establishments, selling directly to the end user (i.e.,
the farmer), while formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities sell to distributors or retailers. EPA's approach
to developing effluent guidelines and standards is different between the two groups due in large part to the nature
and origin of the wastewater, as explained below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refilling establishments of agricultural chemicals repackage pesticide products from bulk storage tanks into
smaller portable containers commonly referred to as minibulk or shuttle tanks. These refillable containers are
constructed of plastic and typically have capacities ranging from 100 to 500 gallons. Minibulk containers may be
owned by the refilling establishment, the pesticide registrant, or by the end user. Refilling establishments do
not formulate a registered pesticide product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refilling establishments may also offer additional pesticide services such as custom blending and commercial application.
Pesticide products are usually blended with water or other carriers and applied to farmers' fields using trucks equipped
with application equipment. Of the estimated 1,134 refilling establishments estimated by the 1988 data, 935 are
estimated to provide application services of registered pesticide products. Today's notice does not apply to facilities
that offer custom application services unless they are also refilling establishments of agricultural pesticide
chemicals. Refilling establishments frequently provide fertilizer sales and application as well as selling seeds
and other farm supplies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refilling establishments are usually located in small towns and serve rural agricultural areas. The largest concentration
of refilling establishments is in EPA Regions V and VII which contain most of the midwestern agricultural states.

An estimated 97 percent of the products reported to be repackaged and 90 percent of the total 1988 production (in pounds)
are classified as herbicides. Nine products classified as fungicides were reported to be repackaged by refilling
establishments; these amounted to less than two percent of the total production (in pounds). These fungicides are
commonly used in grain storage areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agricultural pesticide products that are repackaged at refilling establishments contain various percentages
of one or more of the 272 active ingredients that were part of the survey. An estimated 1,746 products that are repackaged
contained between 40 percent and 50 percent active ingredients. An estimated 30 million pounds, (44 percent of the
total pounds) including 504 products repackaged by these facilities contained between 80 percent and 90 percent
active ingredient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of active ingredient(s) in a product may vary somewhat with the type of formulation of the product. The five
active ingredients that were repackaged in the greatest quantity by the water-using refilling establishments are
listed below:

&bull;EPTC is used as a herbicide to control perennial grassy weeds in a variety of crops such as beans, legumes, potatoes,
and corn. An estimated 22 million pounds of EPTC were used in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments
in 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Alachlor is used as a preemergence herbicide to control certain grasses and weeds in crops such as corn, cotton,
soybeans, and potatoes. An estimated six million pounds of alachlor were used in products repackaged by the water-using
refilling establishments in 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Metolachlor is used as a preemergence and preplant herbicide to control weeds in a variety of crops such as corn,
soybean, peanuts, potatoes, cotton and grain sorghum. An estimated four million pounds of metolachlor were used
in products repackaged by the water-using refilling establishments in 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Atrazine is a herbicide used to control various weeds used mainly on corn and sorghum crops. An estimated 3.7

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Butylate is used as a preemergence herbicide for grassy weeds mainly on corn. An estimated 1.7 million pounds

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Pesticide Programs also classifies products by their type of formulation. The largest percentage of
products reported to be repackaged by water using refilling establishments were emulsifiable concentrates, which
composed an estimated 74 percent of the products repackaged and 80 percent of the total 1988 production in pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production lines at refilling establishments typically consist of a bulk storage tank, a minibulk into which the
product is repackaged, and any interconnecting hoses, piping and pumps. The bulk storage tanks are usually clustered
together, and the repackaging operations are controlled by the use of either a computer- or manually-regulated system
of pumps and meters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some refilling establishments dedicate their bulk storage tanks, hoses, piping and pumps to one product to prevent
any cross contamination of products that are applied to different crops. When a repackaging line was used to repackage
more than one product, the establishment may have switched to a different product on that line during the season to
meet farmers' demands. For example, several refilling establishments in the midwest that were contacted for the
phone survey reported switching from repackaging corn pesticides to soybean pesticides during the middle of the
season. These establishments may or may not have utilized a single line to repackage these different products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately half of the refilling establishments reported operating their lines on an as-needed basis and the
remainder reported that they operated their lines during only one period. In both cases, the facility provides the
product on an as-needed basis to meet the demands of a transitory market. The busiest period for repackaging is March
through June.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that 1,806 facilities (PFPR facilities and refilling establishments combined) use water in their
formulating, packaging or repackaging process. The median annual volume of water discharged by PFPR facilities
is 3,003 gallons, except for manufacturing facilities that formulate and package with a median annual volume of formulating
and packaging wastewater of 261,174 gallons. The average annual volume of water discharged, as reported by refilling
establishments, is approximately 78 gallons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities reported no water use. EPA estimates there are
633 facilities nationwide that do not use water in their formulating, packaging or repackaging process. Of the estimated
PFPR facilities that use water in their formulating, packaging or repackaging process 652 discharge wastewater
to surface water or Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs), 19 refilling establishments are indirect dischargers
to POTWs. An estimated 457 facilities recycle or reuse on-site some or all of their wastewater. In some cases, facilities
treat and reuse their process wastewater before reusing it. An estimated 142 facilities use off-site disposal of
some or all of their wastewater. Reports of off-site disposal included incineration, deepwell injection and centralized
waste treatment facilities. An estimated 93 facilities dispose of some or all of their wastewater to septic systems
or by land application.

Previously established BPT for pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging requires zero discharge of process
wastewater pollutants. Nevertheless, there are a small number of facilities identified through EPA's survey that
do discharge directly to surface waters. Most of these facilities are also manufacturing active ingredients and
they combine the wastewater from formulating, packaging or repackaging with the other process wastewater through
their wastewater treatment systems. These facilities seek to show compliance with their National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, which include no allowance for the pollutants present in the formulating
or packaging wastewater, by showing that their combined discharge (consisting of both manufacturing and formulating,
packaging or repackaging wastewaters) meets the permit limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's survey of the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging industry revealed that process wastewater
derives primarily from cleaning the process equipment, shipping and raw material containers, the general processing
area, laboratory equipment, and safety equipment. Occasionally, formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities
will have an air pollution control scrubber, contaminated stormwater (fairly common at refilling establishments),
or a heated water bath in which aerosol containers are tested for leaks. Wastewater generated by cleaning the interior
of formulating or packaging equipment, bulk storage tanks, or the interior of raw material and shipping containers
contains the highest concentrations of active ingredient and product constituents. Since these wastewaters are
generated from the cleaning interiors of equipment or containers, they are referred to as ``interior'' cleaning
wastewater sources for purposes of this regulation. Wastewater from cleaning the general facility, including floors,
the exterior of equipment, and laboratory or safety equipment, DOT aerosol test baths, and air pollution scrubbers
will also be contaminated with active ingredients and product, but are likely to be less concentrated and may be contaminated
with other pollutants unrelated to the product's constituents. These latter sources of wastewater are referred
to as ``non-interior'' cleaning wastewater sources. EPA believes that the interior waste streams will generally
be capable of reuse directly without application of wastewater treatment technologies. In contrast, the non-interior
waste streams may not be capable of reuse back into the product because of non-product constituents that may be present,
but may be reused elsewhere in the facility (e.g., as floor washwater) after treatment to remove or reduce pollutant
concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formulation type of the pesticide products will also have an effect on the wastewater characteristics. For example,
some pesticide active ingredients are not very soluble in water, therefore the product may use an organic solvent
as a carrier for the active ingredient. Such formulations may contain agents such as surfactants and emulsifiers
to aid in keeping the active ingredient in solution when applied. Some pesticide products are produced as a solid.
The active ingredient may be a solid or liquid that is sprayed onto a dry substrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA collected wastewater samples from thirteen PFPR facilities. Eight facilities were sampled over a period of two
or three days and numerous wastewater samples were collected. Six of these facilities operated treatment systems
which were the focus of the sampling episode. One of the six facilities with treatment was sampled during two distinct
episodes. The remaining five facilities were sampled during a one-day site visit. Usually only one sample was collected
from these five. EPA concentrated on sampling facilities that are operating wastewater treatment technologies.
EPA has also attempted to characterize a variety of different formulation types with as many different active ingredients
as possible. Most of the eight facilities sampled over a period of days are formulating and packaging a variety of products
containing a number of active ingredients. Therefore, although in many cases all wastewaters may be combined and
EPA may not have been able to characterize wastewater from each production batch, a considerable amount of data has
been collected on the nature and characteristics of wastewaters generated by formulating, packaging and repackaging
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has not sampled any wastewater from refilling establishments, however 7 facilities have been visited.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities employ many pollution prevention, recycle and
reuse practices. As described above, wastewater is mainly generated by cleaning the production areas and associated
equipment. Throughout the site visiting program, EPA noticed that pollution prevention practices are widely accepted
and practiced by the industry. Recycle and reuse practices are evident in addition to other practices which are widely
used by facilities in this industry for water conservation or to avoid creating a wastewater source. EPA believes
that some or all of these practices can be implemented at all pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging facilities.

The following discussion describes how pollution prevention, recycle, reuse and water conservation practices
are applied by formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities included in EPA's survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Shipping Container/Drum Cleaning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Facilities frequently receive pesticide raw materials in containers such as 55-gallon steel or 30-gallon fiber
drums. In some cases, the empty drums are returned to the supplier for reconditioning and reuse, but usually the PFPR
facility is responsible for disposal of the drums. Many PFPR facilities reported rinsing raw material containers
after emptying. This practice was also common at the facilities visited. The simplest, and generally the best method
for handling the rinsate is to add the rinsate to the product being formulated. This practice not only eliminates a
potential highly concentrated wastewater source, but also recovers the product value of the raw material. Some facilities
employ a high-pressure, low-volume wash system equipped with a hose and a spray nozzle to triple rinse drums. Such
wash systems are reported to use 5 to 15 gallons of water to rinse a drum. EPA identified many facilities that reuse the
rinsates from shipping containers directly into product formulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Bulk Tank Rinsate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities sometimes store large quantities of formulated pesticide
products and raw materials in bulk tanks. These tanks are typically rinsed only when it becomes necessary to use the
tank for storage of a different material. These tanks are most commonly found at refilling establishments for agricultural
pesticides, where they are used to hold formulated pesticides (rather than raw materials) and where it is also more
likely that they will need to be cleaned due to product changeover. For example, a refilling establishment may store
bulk quantities of a pesticide product used for corn crops during the spring and then switch in the summer to storing
a pesticide product used for soybeans. Each time the facility switches the product stored in a bulk tank, the tank is
rinsed. Bulk tanks are sometimes also rinsed at the end of a season as part of general maintenance procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recovery of product value from bulk tank rinsates is a common pollution prevention practice in the industry. Bulk
tank rinsates have been reused by some PFPR facilities into product formulations and by some refilling establishments
in application mixtures of pesticides mixtures (using the rinsate as make-up water). EPA has observed that facilities
can usually store this rinsate on site until the opportunity arises to add it to a formulation or use it for application.
Facilities can also minimize the amount of rinsate generated during bulk tank cleaning by using high-pressure, low-volume
washers. Some PFPR facilities have also demonstrated that the use of squeegees reduces wastewater generation during
the cleaning of bulk tanks. The smaller the volume of water needed to clean the bulk tank, the more readily the entire
volume can be recovered by addition to the product or application mixture.

3. Equipment Interior Cleaning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Formulated and packaged products may be either liquid or solid. A liquid formulating and packaging line often consists
of mix tanks, melt kettles (if necessary), transfer piping or hoses and pumps, filters prior to packaging, and a packaging
hopper and fillers operating over a conveyor belt. A dry formulating and packaging line often consists of crushing,
pulverizing, grinding, and/or milling equipment; blenders; screening equipment; and the packaging equipment.
Repackaging is often a simple process of transferring material manually from one container into another of different
size. For both liquid and dry operations, the packaging equipment is often portable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities often do not dedicate line equipment to a specific product because most facilities produce many products
and the production schedules for any one product are usually seasonal and can be very infrequent. Often the equipment
is used for short-term production campaigns, and can be used for both pesticide and non-pesticide products. To ensure
product quality, the production line equipment is normally cleaned between product changeovers. Many facilities
perform routine periodic cleaning of production lines for maintenance and, on occasion, also perform special or
non-routine cleaning due to equipment failures or the use of materials that require additional cleaning time or cleaning
solvents. Different types of lines (i.e., dry, liquid, emulsifiable concentrates, etc.) require different cleaning
methods, such as water or solvent rinsing, flushing with solid material, mechanical abrasion, or a combination of
these techniques.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lines handling dry products are usually cleaned by flushing with the solid, inert material used as the carrier for
the products handled on the line. This may be followed by rinsing with water when additional cleaning is required.
EPA has seen one facility which used the dry diluent to clean equipment out on a routine basis. However, the facility
thoroughly cleans out the equipment interiors with water prior to product changeover or line shut down for the season.
Because the product is dry and this water cannot be reused to recover its product value, this particular facility treats
the wastewater and recycles it back for use in the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquid lines are usually rinsed between changeovers with either water or an organic solvent, depending on the production
just completed and the product to be produced next on the line. Water cleaning is also performed for routine maintenance.
Changeover cleanings can be eliminated or greatly reduced by dedicating equipment to specific products or groups
of products. Although entire lines are not generally dedicated, EPA is aware of many facilities that dedicate formulation
mix tanks to specific products, thereby eliminating one of the most highly concentrated wastewater streams generated
by formulating, packaging or repackaging pesticide products. Facilities also dedicate lines to the production
of a specific product type, such as water-based versus solvent-based products, thereby reducing the number of cleanings
required, and allowing for greater reuse of the cleaning water or solvent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another effective pollution prevention technique identified by EPA is the scheduling of production to reduce the
number of product changeovers, which reduces the number of equipment interior cleanings required. Facilities may
also reduce the number of changeover cleanings or the quantity of water or solvent used for cleaning by scheduling
products in groups or ``families.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective water conservation technique that EPA has observed for equipment interior cleaning is to equip water
hoses with hand-control devices (for example, spray-gun nozzles) to prevent free flow of water from unattended hoses,
and employing high-pressure, low-volume washers instead of ordinary hoses. One of the facilities visited indicated
that the use of high-pressure washers reduced typical equipment interior rinse volumes from 20 gallons per rinse
to 10 gallons per rinse. Steam cleaning can also be used to clean equipment interiors while producing less wastewater.
Steam cleaning can be a particularly effective method to clean viscous products that might otherwise require considerable
water and/or detergent to remove. Many facilities will have access to steam from boilers on-site, however, if there
is no existing source of steam, steam cleaning equipment is available for purchase. Although steam generation can
increase energy consumption and add NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pollutants to the atmosphere, the benefits to be gained by creating a small volume of wastewater and potentially avoiding
the need to use detergents or other cleaning agents which could prevent product recovery, make steam very attractive
for some applications. The Agency cautions that steam could be a poor choice for cleaning applications where volatile
organic solvents or inerts are part of the product as the steam would accelerate the volatilization of the organics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities also clean equipment interiors by using squeegees to remove the product from the formulation vessel and
by using absorbent ``pigs'' for cleaning products out of the transfer lines before equipment rinsing. These techniques
minimize the quantity of cleaning water required. Regardless of whether or not residual product is removed from equipment
interiors before rinsing, equipment interior rinsate can typically be reused as makeup water the next time that a
water-based product is being formulated.

4. Department of Transportation (DOT) Aerosol Container Leak Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOT leak test bath water is a source of wastewater at aerosol packaging facilities since it must be changed periodically,
due to the buildup of contaminants in the water. Leaking (or occasionally exploding) cans contaminate the water bath
with pesticide product. Can exteriors may also contaminate the bath water since they may have product or solvent on
them from the can filling step. According to several facilities, pesticide products and solvents can cause visibility
problems in the bath water and leave an oily residue on the cans exiting the bath. One of the facilities visited also
indicated that bath water must be dumped and refilled periodically to prevent rust particles from fouling steam sparging
equipment (used to heat the bath). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No method of eliminating this source of wastewater has been identified; however, the volume of water used may be minimized
through the use of a contained water bath as opposed to a continuous overflow water bath. A contained water bath is completely
emptied and refilled with water when required, based upon visual inspection by the operator. Therefore, the quantity
of wastewater generated is dependent on the volume of the bath (200 gallons is a typical volume of the contained water
baths at visited facilities) and the frequency of refilling. It is the Agency's opinion that the best practice to reduce
wastewater generated by aerosol container (DOT) leak testing is to use a contained water bath where the water is changed
out when it is determined to be ``dirty'' by visual inspection.

5. Floor/Wall/Equipment Exterior Cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities clean the equipment exteriors and floors for general
housekeeping purposes and to keep sources of product contamination to a minimum. When water is used, these cleaning
procedures become a source of wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment exteriors and floor areas of dry formulating and packaging lines are typically cleaned without the use
of water. Vacuuming, scraping, and other mechanical means are used to clean the areas around these lines. Floors and
equipment exteriors associated with liquid lines, and occasionally dry lines when an especially thorough cleaning
is desired, are rinsed with water (or an aqueous-based cleaning solution, or possibly an organic solvent to clean
equipment exteriors). While some facilities routinely clean equipment exteriors and floors, or do so at all changeovers
between certain products, many facilities have indicated that equipment exterior and floor cleanings are performed
only when required through visual inspections by the operators or facility management. Walls around formulating
and packaging lines appear to be cleaned infrequently. Therefore, wastewater from such cleaning is rarely generated.
The quantity of water used annually for equipment exterior or floor cleaning varies widely from facility to facility,
from several gallons to thousands of gallons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This wastewater source can be minimized through the use of high-pressure, low-volume washers. Facilities have noted
that attaching spray nozzles or other devices to prevent the free flow of water from unattended hoses has reduced water
use. Additionally, steam cleaning of equipment exteriors is practiced at some facilities to reduce the amount of
wastewater generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has identified some facilities that wipe the exterior using rags, or use a solvent cleaner, such as a commercially
available stainless steel cleaner. This avoids the generation of a wastewater stream, but creates a solid waste which,
depending on the ingredients involved, could be considered a hazardous waste. Squeegees are also used to clean equipment
exteriors and floors, and are not disposed after single uses. It may be possible to dedicate squeegees to a certain
line or piece of equipment, but the use of squeegees may still require some water. Automated floor scrubbers are also
employed at some facilities in place of hosing down floors. Mopping with a single bucket of water can also be employed
in place of hosing. Floor mopping can generate as little as 10 gallons of water per cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has been to a number of facilities where their floor wash water is reused with and without filtering. One facility
has set up its production equipment on a steel grated, mezzanine platform directly above a collection sump. Following
production, the equipment and the floor of the platform, on which the operator stands when formulating product, are
rinsed down and the water is allowed to drip into the sump. A pump and a filter have been installed in the sump area to enable
the operator to transfer this rinsate back into the formulation tank the next time he is ready to formulate. This sump
is also connected to floor trenches in the packaging area for the same product. When the exterior of the packaging equipment
and the floors in this area are rinsed, this water is directed to the trenches and eventually ends up in the collection
sump for reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Agency's opinion that wastewater generated from floor and equipment cleaning can be best reduced by: (1)
Sweeping the area before rinsing; (2) cleaning on visual inspection rather than routine/daily cleaning; (3) using
a floor scrubbing machine or a mop and a bucket to clean the floors; and (4) using a high pressure, low volume hose with
a spray nozzle or a steam cleaning machine to clean equipment exteriors.

6. Leaks and Spills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Leaks and spills occur during the normal course of formulating and packaging operations. Leaks originate at hose
connections or valves. Spills of raw materials occur from failures of bulk storage tanks and/or during transfer of
raw materials between vessels. Product spills can occur during storage in bulk storage tanks and/or during packaging,
including overfilling containers, missing the container to be filled, or tipping of filled containers before capping.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leaks can be reduced by preventive maintenance such as checking equipment and connections before use or on a regular
basis, while good housekeeping procedures like keeping work areas uncluttered can help in the prevention of spills.
Simple preventative measures such as placing drip pans under areas where leaks and spills are likely to occur can either
eliminate or minimize the quantity of water required for many types of cleanups. Leaks and spills of dry products can
be vacuumed or swept without generating any wastewater. Liquid leaks and spills can be collected into a trench or sump
(for reuse, discharge, or disposal) with a squeegee, leaving only a residue to be mopped or hosed down if further water
cleanup is required. Liquid leaks and spills can also be cleaned up using absorbent material, such as absorbent pads
or soda ash. For an acidic product, the use of soda ash or a similar base material will also serve to neutralize the spill.
If a residue remains, some water may be used for mopping or hosing the area down, but methods to reduce floor wash should
be implemented whenever possible. EPA has observed that many facilities cleanup liquid leaks and spills from water-based
products with water and reuse the wastewater in product formulation. On the other hand the facilities generally cleanup
liquid leaks and spills from solvent-based products with absorbent materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct reuse of materials from leaks and spills is another possible pollution prevention technique. If drip pans
or other containers are used to catch leaks and spills, the material can be immediately reused in the product being
formulated or packaged, or stored for use in the next product batch. Collection hoppers or tubs can be installed beneath
packaging fillers to capture spills and immediately direct the spills back to the fillers. Leaks or spills around
bulk storage tanks and dispensing areas can be contained by dikes, which, in fact, are often required by state regulations.
(EPA recently proposed a federal regulation for containment structures at agricultural refilling establishments
and at certain other facilities (see 59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some PFPR facilities employ wet scrubbers to reduce air emissions from PFPR operations. Facilities that also perform
non-PFPR operations may employ scrubbers that are not specific to PFPR operations, but instead serve the general
facility. Scrubbers can be operated with continuously recycled water until replacement of the contaminated water
is necessary (as practiced by one of the facilities visited) or they can be operated with a bleed steam (blowdown) on
a continuous basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many PFPR facilities employ dry air pollution control equipment, such as carbon filters and baghouses, thus accomplishing
air pollution reduction without generating wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some facilities may only need a wet scrubber on one particular process (i.e., a dedicated scrubber). These facilities
have been able to use the scrubber blowdown or changed-out scrubber water as make-up water in the formulation of that
particular product. Some facilities with non-dedicated scrubbers have been able to use the scrubber blowdown or
changed-out scrubber water for floor or equipment exterior cleaning.

8. Safety Equipment Cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most PFPR facilities employ the use of safety equipment, including safety showers and eye washes, gloves, respirators,
and rubber boots to protect individuals from the dangers associated with some raw materials and the production of
PFPR products. Wastewater is generated from routine checks of safety showers, routine flushes of eye wash stations
(to ensure the station is clean and operable), and rinsing of boots, gloves, and respirators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantities of contaminated wastewater generated from safety equipment cleaning are generally on the order of several
gallons or tens of gallons. Some facilities are successful in avoiding the generation of this type of wastewater by
using disposable safety clothing (gloves, dust masks). This practice does result in a solid and possibly even hazardous
waste stream, thus it does not prevent pollution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many PFPR facilities operate on-site laboratories for conducting quality control (QC) tests of raw materials and
formulated products. Wastewater is generated from these tests and from cleaning glassware used in the tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One effective pollution prevention technique for laboratory equipment cleaning is to dedicate laboratory sinks
to certain products, so wastewater generated from testing a product can be collected for reuse in the product or for
transfer back to the PAI manufacturer or product registrant. In the cases where solvents are often used in conjunction
with the QC tests performed in the laboratory, the facility may not be able to reuse the solvent-contaminated water.
One facility uses a small activated carbon unit to treat their lab water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This source of wastewater includes all precipitation that falls directly onto or runs onto PFPR facilities that is
believed to be contaminated by product constituents. Contaminated precipitation runoff can be prevented by bringing
all PFPR operations indoors, as many PFPR facilities have done, or roofing outdoor storage tanks and dikes, which
has also been done at many PFPR facilities. The roofs must extend low enough to prevent crosswinds from blowing rain
or other precipitation into spill-containment dikes. To prevent rainwater contamination, the drain spouts and
gutters should conduct roof runoff to areas away from PFPR operations, and the roofs should be kept in good repair.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has sampled six facilities with wastewater treatment. Through EPA's survey of the formulating, packaging and
repackaging industry, very few facilities were found that use water in their formulating, packaging and repackaging
process that also treat their wastewater. Most facilities discharge their wastewater indirectly to POTW's with
little or no pretreatment. Many facilities send some of their more concentrated streams off-site for disposal or
treatment, and many others reported recycling or reusing some or all of their wastewater. Of the few facilities that
reported treatment, most are treating their wastewater and recycling it back to the facility. Five of the six sampled
facilities that are treating their wastewater were recycling their treated wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the six sampled facilities treated wastewaters from floor and equipment exteriors cleaning with ultrafiltration
followed by activated carbon filtration. The treated water is recycled back to be used for this purpose again. At the
same facility most of the wastewater generated by cleaning equipment interiors is recycled back into the product.
This facility segregates wastewaters generated in the insecticide formulation area from those generated in the
herbicide formulation area but otherwise mixes all herbicide or insecticide wastewaters together for treatment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second facility treats its wastewater through a filtration system with a portion of the wastewater stream being
sent to biological treatment. Most of the filtered wastewater is recycled to the facility for reuse as general process
area cleaning water. The wastewater treated through biological treatment is sent for use as make-up in the general
facility air pollution control scrubber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other facilities treat their wastewater through a cross-flow filter followed by activated carbon filtration.
The wastewaters are then sent back to the processing area to be used for general clean-up. Another facility treats
its wastewater through ozonation followed by activated carbon filtration. This wastewater is recycled back to the
facility for reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth facility sampled is also a manufacturer of pesticide active ingredient. This facility treats its formulating
and packaging wastewater along with its manufacturing wastewater through an activated carbon system prior to discharge
to an industrial pretreatment facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other surveyed facilities that treat their wastewaters were mostly the pesticide manufacturing facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through site visits or phone follow-ups, EPA discovered that some plants have instituted several changes to wastewater
handling practices since 1988. For example, one of the sampled facilities with wastewater treatment has since shut
down. Between 1988 and shut down, the operation converted from discharge to reuse of wastewater. Two of the facilities
that were sampled for wastewater treatment system performance have installed treatment since 1988. Another facility
that was sampled for its wastewater treatment system had upgraded its system by adding ozonation treatment after
1988.

A. Pesticide Chemicals Formulating, Packaging and Repackaging (Subcategory C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is not proposing any substantive amendments to the existing BPT provisions applicable to Subcategory C, established
in 1978. However, EPA proposes to add the word repackaging to the title and the applicability provision for subpart
C (&sect;455.40) and to specifically exclude from BPT applicability the wastewaters generated by employee showers
and laundry facilities. These changes are being proposed to clarify the types of operations covered and would not
expand or contract the current coverage of the BPT effluent limitations guidelines. The term ``packagers'' in the
subpart C applicability provision, 40 CFR 455.40, was always intended to cover repackaging as well as packaging.
Likewise, EPA proposes to expressly exclude from coverage wastewaters generated by employee showers (distinct
from safety showers, which are included), fire protection test water and laundry facilities. The current regulation
does not expressly state whether employee showers and laundry facilities are process wastewater sources. EPA is
proposing to clarify that employee showers, fire protection test water and laundries are not within the scope of coverage
because of concerns that their inclusion could cause a disincentive for facilities to provide shower facilities
for their employees, which in turn could pose a potential health and safety concern. Fire protection test water is
generated by facilities testing sprinkler systems or hydrants to ensure their operation should the facility have
a fire. EPA does not wish to create a disincentive for this testing by controlling these waters especially since it
is unlikely they would be contaminated. EPA is aware of PFPR facilities that have permits allowing discharges from
employee showers and laundries while other PFPR wastewater sources at the facilities are required by their permits
to achieve zero discharge. EPA is soliciting comment on this clarification of the applicability of the PFPR regulations
to wastewater from showers, fire protection test water and laundries.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BPT limitations for this subcategory require zero discharge of wastewater pollutants. EPA's information shows
that the majority of PFPR facilities are complying with this requirement by virtue of the large numbers of facilities
which reported no discharge (an estimated 71 percent of the survey population) and because nearly all facilities
that reported discharging are indirect dischargers (to POTW's). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BPT technologies identified in the 1978 regulation as capable of achieving zero discharge were water conservation,
reuse and recycle practices, with any residual water being evaporated or hauled off-site to a landfill. Several facilities
that participated in a study of the industry for that rulemaking reported using evaporation as the principal means
for disposing of wastewater from their formulating and packaging operations. Since that time, the practice of disposing
of liquid hazardous wastes in landfills has been banned. (Nevertheless, one recently surveyed facility did indicate
that they send wastewater to a landfill.) Additionally, EPA finds that disposal of wastewater by evaporation is now
a less preferred practice, presumably because of concerns about pollutant transfers among media (e.g., air, soil,
groundwater). In our recent survey, EPA has found that only a small proportion of PFPR facilities use evaporation
to achieve zero discharge. Mostly, zero discharge is attained through recycle and reuse, though some facilities
report hauling their wastewater off-site. Off-site destinations include incinerators, deep wells, and commercial
waste treaters (in some cases, wastes are returned to the registrant or manufacturer). Some facilities that are achieving
zero discharge have gone to considerable expense and installed state-of-the-art wastewater treatment to accomplish
it through treatment and recycling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of recent revisions to the effluent guidelines for pesticide manufacturers (58 FR 50637, September 28, 1993),
some of the facilities that manufacture pesticide active ingredients and also formulate and package pesticide products
may have to change their current practices to comply with the existing BPT regulations for formulating and packaging.
A number of the direct discharging pesticide manufacturers that also formulate and package have been combining pesticide
manufacturing wastewaters with wastewaters generated from pesticide formulating and packaging and discharging
the combined wastewaters. They are able to combine these wastewaters and still achieve the limits in their NPDES permits,
which provide numeric discharge limits for pollutants generated in the pesticide manufacturing process. Although
they are given no allowance for the pollutants present in their formulating and packaging wastewater they have been
able to discharge this wastewater because the treatment systems reduce the pollutants in the combined wastewater
to the level specified in their permits. The recently issued pesticide manufacturing regulation sets production-based
BAT limits for specific active ingredients. These limits supersede the previous concentration-based BPT limit
for ``total pesticides.'' Due to these newly issued BAT limits, it is unlikely that pesticide manufacturing facilities
will be able to continue to discharge their formulating and packaging wastewater and still be in compliance with their
new permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not project any costs associated with BPT regulations for any direct discharging pesticide formulating,
packaging or repackaging facilities in Subcategory C, because BPT for Subcategory C is not being amended.

B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments Whose Principal Business is Retail

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, refilling establishments generate wastewater through cleaning minibulk containers and bulk
storage tanks; also, contaminated precipitation run-off often falls inside their containment systems. BPT for
these wastewaters from repackaging operations is proposed to be zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing BPT regulations do not cover refilling establishments. As described above, the practice of refilling
minibulks, etc. did not begin until the 1980s, i.e., after the original BPT regulation was promulgated in 1978. Further,
the refillers are different from the general packagers and repackagers because of the differences in their volumes
of wastewater generated and discharged, the homogeneity at refilling establishments of processes, water generation
and disposal practices, and products being repackaged at refilling establishments, and the differences between
the type of business (e.g., retail sales vs. wholesale sales) as described earlier. These types of facilities were
not part of the data base for the original BPT regulations and were not considered in the development of those regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that secondary containment of bulk storage areas and loading pads, plus the collection, holding and eventual
reuse of rinsates, contaminated precipitation run-off and leaks and spills represents the best practicable technology
for the refillers subcategory. The Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs has proposed a regulation under FIFRA that
would require refilling establishments for agricultural pesticides to build secondary containment structures
and loading pads to certain specifications (59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994). The secondary containment structures
are designed to collect spills, rinsates from containers, and contaminated precipitation run-off. Today's proposal
builds on this proposed requirement to contain contaminated wastewater by proposing that the contained wastewater
may not be discharged. It is likely, therefore, that the wastewater will be held until such time as it can be applied
as pesticide on a site compatible with the product label or used as make-up water in an application of pesticide chemical
to an appropriate site. Of the estimated 1134 facilities (based on the 1988 survey) that would be affected by today's
proposal, EPA's questionnaire responses indicate that 98 percent or an estimated 1101 already achieve zero discharge,
primarily by holding contaminated wastewater and reusing it as make-up water. Thus, this practice not only eliminates
the discharge of wastewater but also allows the facility to recover the value of the product in the wastewater. Accordingly,
EPA concludes that this proposal represents the average of the best performance at existing facilities. Indeed,
because the proposal is to require zero discharge, this also represents the best performance at any existing facility,
and therefore EPA is also identifying zero discharge as the basis for BAT and PSES regulations (See below).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Office of Pesticide Programs proposed rule would already require these facilities to contain any contaminated
wastewater, the Office of Water does not expect there to be a significant additional cost associated with the holding
of this water until such time as it can be used as make-up in commercial application. There are no existing direct dischargers
in this subcategory that EPA is aware of. The average volume of wastewater discharged indirectly by refilling establishments
is estimated to be 78 gallons per year per facility. EPA assumes volumes of this magnitude can be held in a minibulk container
until such a time as it can be reused. EPA estimates the cost of a minibulk container to be about $300 capital investment.
EPA concludes that the cost of this proposed BPT regulation would not be wholly disproportionate to the projected
effluent reduction benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, the sources of wastewater from refilling establishments derive primarily from rinsates generated
from cleaning minibulk containers and bulk storage tanks. Another source of wastewater that might contribute a significant
volume is contaminated stormwater. The current practice for many refilling establishments is to contain and hold
contaminated stormwater until it can be used as make-up in a commercial application. However, this source can be virtually
eliminated by covering the bulk storage area and loading pad under roof. According to an industry representative,
it is becoming a widespread practice for many of the midwestern refilling establishments to do this. In addition to
potentially avoiding the generation of a contaminated wastewater that must be controlled, enclosing the bulk storage
area also protects it from vandalism and from severe weather such as cold winters. Enclosing containment structures
is not a basis for today's proposed regulation, nor is it a requirement of the Office of Pesticide Programs proposed
containment rule. However, the Agency would certainly consider roofing a bulk storage area and loading pad a prudent
and pollution-preventing action by refilling establishments. EPA does also recognize that there may be barriers
in some areas to enclosing bulk storage under roofs, such as fire code restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that it is not uncommon for refilling establishments to have more than one pesticide product on-site
to be used on different crops. For example, a refilling establishment may have bulk Bicep
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (atrazine and metolachlor) that is applied to corn early in the season, and also have Freedom
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (alachlor and trifluralin), which is applied to soybeans later in the growing season. Mixtures of rinsates of the
two products (Bicep

&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) cannot be used in an application mixture if there is no crop for which the two pesticides are mutually labelled. In
estimating costs, the Agency has assumed that the containment system, including separate holding tanks, will segregate
pesticide products to avoid spills and stormwater from becoming cross contaminated. EPA has seen this segregation
in containment systems at refilling establishments which have been designed to comply with state or local requirements.

for BPT. Since BPT requires zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants and there can be no more stringent limitations,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to establish PSES at the zero discharge level. The best available technologies identified
as a basis for these proposed standards consist of recycle and reuse of wastewater and treatment, where necessary,
of wastewater by the Universal Treatment System prior to recycle/reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's detailed evaluation of the technology-based options is described in the following paragraphs of this section
of the preamble. This evaluation utilizes as a basis the results of the industry survey, which focused on facilities
involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging the 272 active ingredients that were covered in the recently
promulgated (September 28, 1993, 58 FR 50637) manufacturing effluent guidelines and standards. Based on sample
results of the survey there are an estimated 2439 facilities involved in formulating, packaging and repackaging
the 272 active ingredients. Information obtained primarily from OPP Section 7 data bases on registered products,
and also from the survey and EPA facility visits and sampling episodes were used to evaluate approximately 1300 of
the 2400 facilities with respect to product lines that formulate, package or repackage process both the 272 active
ingredients and other active ingredients covered by this proposed rule. As a second phase of the evaluation, approximately
1500 facilities that process only the non-272 active ingredients were evaluated. These facilities were identified
from the FIFRA registration data for the base year of 1988. Based on the formulating, packaging and repackaging practices
and the types of products being similar or the same at these facilities as that seen and/or reported as part of the data
base for the 272 active ingredients, EPA has extrapolated the detailed evaluation of the 272 active ingredients to
propose coverage of all PFPR facilities and refilling establishments. EPA visited 51 PFPR facilities to conduct
a technical inspection of the facilities, their production processes, wastewater generation, pollution prevention
and wastewater treatment practices. Of those 51 facilities 39 also formulate, package or repackage pesticide products
containing the non-272 active ingredient(s). Based on observations and discussions with facility personnel, EPA
believes that the production practices, pollution prevention practices and treatment practices (where they exist)
are the same for the products containing the 272 active ingredients and the products containing the non-272 active
ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only FIFRA registered products that would not be covered by this PSES proposal are pesticide products containing
the active ingredient sodium hypochlorite (also called bleach). EPA proposes to exclude sodium hypochlorite from
the applicability of PSES because it is commonly classified as an inorganic chemical even though it has registered
pesticidal uses. EPA notes that it would be inappropriate to combine wastewater generated from formulating, packaging
or repackaging sodium hypochlorite with wastewater from other active ingredients due to the high probability that
the sodium hypochlorite will react with organic active ingredients and inerts, generating chlorinated organics.
Thus, EPA expects that wastewaters generated from the formulating, packaging and repackaging of sodium hypochlorite
are kept separate from other PFPR wastewaters even in facilities where they co-exist (900 facilities formulate,
package or repackage sodium hypochlorite only). Because sodium hypochlorite is commonly classified as an inorganic
chemical and not as a pesticide and because sodium hypochlorite PFPR waste streams are generally expected to be segregated
and treated separately from the remaining PFPR waste streams, EPA proposes not to include sodium hypochlorite PFPR
waste streams within the scope of today's proposed regulations for indirect dischargers. Instead, EPA believes
that sodium hypochlorite formulating, packaging and repackaging waste streams would be more appropriately included
within the coverage of future effluent guidelines rulemakings in other industry categories, e.g., inorganic chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that the existing BPT zero discharge requirement would apply to the sodium hypochlorite PFPR direct
dischargers. EPA is not proposing to amend that requirement, since it has been in place since the 1978 BPT rulemaking
and there is no information that this approach should be changed. However, EPA invites comment on whether to exclude
sodium hypochlorite PFPR waste streams from the regulations for both indirect and direct dischargers. EPA also invites
comment on whether to expand the list of active ingredients excluded from coverage should data become available that
other specific active ingredients are like sodium hypochlorite in that they act as strong oxidizing agents and process
wastewaters should not be combined with other pesticide active ingredients through process wastewater treatment.
Alternatively, if EPA receives information indicating that sodium hypochlorite is not as different from the other
ingredients that are formulated, packaged or repackaged as EPA believes, then EPA may decide to include sodium hypochlorite
discharges within the PSES coverage in the final rule, and would make no changes to the rule's coverage with respect
to direct dischargers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's survey of the pesticide formulating and packaging subcategory projects that out of an estimated 1300 facilities,
formulating, packaging and repackaging the 272 active ingredients that were the focus of the survey, 669 are achieving
zero discharge of process wastewater. Virtually all of the estimated 633 discharging facilities are indirect dischargers.
Of the zero discharge facilities, half reported that they do not use water for any of the purposes identified as being
process-related sources of wastewater. The estimated 342 other facilities reported generating wastewater and
achieving zero discharge of that wastewater through a combination of direct recycle, treatment and recycle, or off-site
disposal. EPA assumes that many of these 342 facilities would be discharging directly, if it were allowed. EPA examined
the wastewater disposal practices of these facilities and made a determination of what constituted the best available
technologies which serve as the basis for PSES.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indirect dischargers in the pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging industry, use as raw materials many
nonconventional pollutants (such as the active ingredients) and priority pollutants. They may be expected to discharge
many of these pollutants to POTWs at significant mass or concentration levels, or both. EPA estimates that indirect
dischargers of products containing one or more of the 272 organic pesticides annually discharge approximately 115,400
pounds of wastewater pollutants to POTWs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA determines which pollutants to regulate in PSES on the basis of whether or not they pass through, interfere with,
or are incompatible with the operation of POTWs (including interference with sludge practices). A pollutant is deemed
pass through when the average percentage removed nationwide by well-operated POTWs (those meeting secondary treatment
requirements) is less than the percentage removed by directly discharging facilities applying BAT for that pollutant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the pesticide manufacturing rule (58 FR 50637, September 28, 1993), EPA has very little empirical data on the
active ingredient removals actually achieved by POTWs. Therefore, the Agency is relying on lab data to estimate the
active ingredient removal performance that would be achieved by biotreatment at well-operated POTWs applying secondary
treatment. The results of this laboratory study are reported in the Domestic Sewage Study (DSS) (Report to Congress
on the Discharge of Hazardous Waste to Publicly Owned Treatment Works, February 1986, EPA/530&hyph;SW&hyph;86&hyph;004).
The DSS provides laboratory data under ideal conditions to estimate biotreatment removal efficiencies at POTWs
for different organic active ingredients structural groups.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has identified zero discharge of wastewater pollutants as achievable with the best available technology, and
this translates to 100 percent removal of active ingredient pollutants, which is considerably greater than the removals
achieved by biotreatment under laboratory conditions for the active ingredients. For each of these active ingredient
structural groups, the DSS shows that average BAT removal efficiencies are considerably greater than the average
active ingredient removals achieved by biotreatment under laboratory conditions for each of the active ingredients
(100 percent removal by the technologies identified as BAT versus an optimistic estimate of 50 percent or less removal
by the POTW as reported in the DSS). Accordingly, all active ingredients were deemed to pass through the treatment
systems at POTWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The active ingredients that are formulated, packaged or repackaged into pesticide products at a given facility are
expected to always be present in the process wastewater. Since EPA's pass through analysis indicates that all active
ingredients pass through, and the facility would be required to achieve zero discharge of the active ingredient,
it would be inappropriate to exempt phenol or 2,4-dimethylphenol (or any other priority pollutant) from regulation
on the basis that they do not pass through a POTW (as EPA did in the recent pesticides manufacturers rulemaking). This
is because these two priority pollutants, which have been determined to be compatible with well-operated secondary
treatment, will never be the only pollutants present in a wastewater stream resulting from pesticide formulating,
packaging or repackaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PFPR facilities often generate wastewater on multiple production lines. Because the wastewater volumes are usually
small, however, it is not practical to operate dedicated wastewater treatment systems to serve individual lines.
Recognizing the need for operational simplicity, EPA believes that centralized wastewater treatment is more appropriate
and has conceptualized a single BAT treatment system for PFPR facilities that the Agency is terming the ``Universal
Treatment System.'' As envisioned by EPA, the Universal Treatment System would be sized to handle small volumes of
wastewater on a batch basis and would combine the most commonly used treatment technologies for pesticide active
ingredients, hydrolysis, chemical precipitation, chemical oxidation, and activated carbon, with one or more pretreatment
steps, such as emulsion breaking, solids settling, and filtration. The BAT performance of the three active ingredient
treatment technologies is well demonstrated and they serve as the full or partial basis for most of the manufacturers'
active ingredient limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging wastewater is expected to contain the constituents of the
pesticide product being formulated. It could be possible that a facility would formulate and package, for example
a product containing an active ingredient that is best treated by hydrolysis and another product that contains an
active ingredient that is best treated by chemical oxidation. The Universal Treatment System is expected to be flexible
in that it can handle these diverse treatment requirements. This system can treat pesticide formulating, packaging
or repackaging wastewater with hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, chemical precipitation and activated carbon or
a combination of these technologies depending on the active ingredients needing to be controlled. The Universal
Treatment System also can accomplish chemical/thermal emulsion breaking, which controls emulsifiers and surfactants
that are added to some pesticide products as inert ingredients. Emulsion breaking may be needed as an initial step
to improve the treatability of the wastewater. As described previously in Section V of this preamble, the Agency conducted
a treatability study using pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging process wastewater from two facilities
to demonstrate the performance of the Universal Treatment System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA envisions the Universal Treatment System as being a flexible treatment system that can treat for a variety of active
ingredients, be sized to handle the small volumes generated by pesticide formulating, packaging and repackaging
facilities, and be operated on a batch basis. EPA expects that the majority of facilities needing treatment will need
less than the full array of control technologies provided in the Universal Treatment System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the Universal Treatment System including pretreatment for emulsifiers/surfactants where needed
and pollution prevention practices and water conservation that lead to the recycle/reuse of the treated wastewaters,
reflects the best available technology for this PSES rulemaking. However these are by no means the only technologies
available to achieve the proposed standards. For example, as described previously in Section VIII of this preamble,
three of the facilities sampled employed an ultrafiltration membrane separation technology or cross-flow filtration
that operates in a similar manner in combination with activated carbon technology. The full Universal Treatment
System may not currently be available on a commercial basis as an off-the-shelf system, but EPA believes that in many
cases there are commercially available systems that will be suitable for a specific facility's needs. Many of the
pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities that do have treatment have purchased off-the-shelf
treatment units such as ultrafiltration or cross-flow filtration membranes and activated carbon systems.

Based on the BAT technology identified by EPA, EPA developed five regulatory options that were considered for PSES.
The Agency estimated the cost and pollutant removal expected to be incurred for each option and evaluated the economic
impacts and cost effectiveness of these options. The Agency selected the proposed regulatory approach based on the
economic and technological achievability of the options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The options considered for PSES are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 would set numeric discharge limits for various pollutants based on end-of-pipe treatment for the entire wastewater
volume currently generated by PFPR facilities through the Universal Treatment System and discharge of the entire
volume to POTWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 adds pollution prevention by requiring zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants for wastewaters generated
from cleaning the interiors of formulating and packaging equipment and raw material and shipping containers, which
can be recycled back into the product to recover the product value in the wastewaters. Numeric discharge limits would
be set for other wastewaters,which would still be expected to be treated through the Universal Treatment System and
discharged to POTWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be based on the same technology and pollution prevention practices as the Option 2. BAT for this option, however,
would include recycling of all process wastewater by recycling the wastewater back to the facility in some cases after
treatment through the Universal Treatment System instead of allowing a discharge after treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 3/S
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the same as Option 3 for all PFPR facilities, except for those facilities that formulate package, or repackage sanitizer
active ingredients and whose sanitizer production is less than 265,000 lbs/yr. Based on the level of impacts imposed
on facilities that formulate, package or repackage these small quantities of sanitizer active ingredients (sanitizer
active ingredients are defined in Table 8 of the regulation) and the small amounts of pollutant discharges from non-interior
sources at sanitizer facilities, EPA developed this option which requires the achievement of zero discharge of interior
wastewaters only. Other wastewater sources generated by formulating packaging or repackaging using sanitizer
active ingredients at these facilities would not be subject to pretreatment standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 incorporates the pollution prevention aspects of Options 2 and 3, but instead of treatment, assumes that wastewaters
that cannot be recycled will be disposed of by off-site incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is based on disposal of all wastewater through off-site incineration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 3/S proposes to exempt the non-interior streams at facilities that formulate, package or repackage less than
265,000 lb/yr sanitizer products for the following reasons: The sanitizers segment is composed almost entirely
of small businesses. The projected impacts of this rulemaking on them are more significant than they are on other PFPR
facilities due primarily to the costs of having to install treatment for their non-interior streams. The amount of
pollutants associated with their non-interior streams is small_about 22 toxic-weighted pound equivalents per
year out of a total toxic weighted loading of 12 million toxic pounds generated by this industry. Therefore, excluding
their non-interior streams from coverage results in basically the same overall reduction in pollutants discharged
by the PFP industry but significantly eases the burden on these small entities (see Section XIV below). This is consistent
with the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which directs agencies to examine ``any significant alternatives
to the proposed rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant
economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities.'' (RFA Section 603). Section 603 also specifically mentions
exemptions from coverage of the rule as one type of alternative that could be examined. EPA also notes that sanitizer
products, in contrast to most other pesticide products, are intended to be discharged to sinks and drains with normal
use and therefore large quantities of the products themselves (apart from the PFP waste streams) end up at the POTW.
EPA is not aware that these products are causing any interferences at POTWs. Further, discharging this small additional
amount of sanitizer chemicals_22 pound-equivalents per year_to POTWs would not materially increase the total amount
of these chemicals being discharged to POTWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1 is more costly and estimated to cause more economic impacts than Options 2, 3, and 3/S due to a higher volume
of water that is costed for treatment through the Universal Treatment System. Options 2 and 3 are estimated to have
the same costs and level of economic impacts since both options are based on the same technology. For simplification
and because the technology is essentially identical the costs are assumed to be identical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reality Option 3 costs could be lower than Option 2, because sampling data indicate that facilities which do treat
wastewater for recycling back to the facility do not always achieve the same degree of pollutant removal from the wastewater
that would be required to comply with numeric standards (see Section V of the Technical Development Document). However,
Option 3 requires the treated wastewater to be recycled rather than discharged thus achieving greater pollutant
removals than Option 2. Options 3/S is less costly than Options 2 and 3, and is expected to cause fewer economic impacts.
Option 4 is more costly than Options 1 through 3/S and Option 5 is more costly than Option 4, though both achieve the same
degree of wastewater pollution control as Option 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide coverage of this proposed rule to the facilities formulating, packaging and repackaging the additional
PAIs not included as part of the 272 PAIs identified in the survey, an additional Option 3/S.1 was evaluated. This Option
was costed to include facility costs for control of the additional non-272 at facilities costed for Option 3/S and
approximately 1500 additional facilities with only non-272 PAIs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the evaluation of the additional facilities Option 3/S.1 has been selected to be the basis for pretreatment
standards for existing sources. This selection provides a basis for PSES that is consistent with requirements for
direct dischargers. Option 3/S.1 represents the performance of the best available technology economically achievable,
incorporating the best existing practices of pollution prevention, recycle/reuse, water conservation and wastewater
treatment in this subcategory. Based on the analysis comparing the various options showing Option 3/S to be less costly
the Agency believes that Option 3/S.1 imposes lesser costs than all other options would if their coverage was expanded,
and achieves greater pollutant removals than Options 1 and 2 with expanded coverage. Options 3, 4 and 5 which require
zero discharge from all wastewater sources remove only slightly more pollutants due to small production sanitizer
chemical facilities being required to treat and recycle their exterior wastewater sources. Since EPA as part of its
analysis in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, has determined that the costs and impacts associated
with installing treatment systems to recycle non-interior wastewater sources at small production sanitizer facilities
can be reduced and the associated pollutant discharges are small (see section XIV of this preamble), Option 3/S.1
was selected. Thus, EPA is proposing to establish separate standards for the formulating, packaging and repackaging
of sanitizer chemicals when total sanitizer product is less than 265,000 lbs/yr, which require these sanitizer facilities
to achieve zero discharge from interior wastewater sources only. The production cut-off of 265,000 lbs/yr represents
the production level of the largest facility that is projected to benefit by an exemption of wastewater treatment
requirements for non-interior wastewater sources. This production level applies to a facility's sum total pounds
of all sanitizer registered products containing one or more of the sanitizer active ingredients listed on Table 8
of the regulation and no other active ingredients.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has estimated the costs associated with the survey database for the 272 active ingredients. Option 3/S would cost
$26.9 million annually and would result in one facility closure and 147 product line closures or conversions. The
expanded coverage of all active ingredients (except for sodium hypochlorite) is estimated to increase the costs
to a final total of $56.1 million annually and would result in an estimated 2 plant closures, and 256 product line closures
or conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that many facilities which formulate, package or repackage both pesticide chemicals and sanitizer chemicals
will not realize any significant relief in their regulatory requirements through Option 3/S (and 3/S.1) as compared
to Option 3. This is because the non-interior waste streams which the Agency is proposing to exclude from coverage
(equipment exterior cleaning, floor washing, laboratory equipment cleaning, safety equipment cleaning, air pollution
scrubbers and contaminated stormwater) for the sanitizer chemicals tend to be related to the activities occurring
throughout the facility not to specific products or even specific production lines. Therefore, unless a combined
facility has dedicated lines that physically separate the sanitizer and non-sanitizer wastewaters, the non-interior
PFPR waste streams will contain both sanitizer and non-sanitizer chemicals and therefore will be controlled by the
pretreatment standards for the non-sanitizer chemicals active ingredients. EPA emphasizes that products which
contain a sanitizer active ingredient and non-sanitizer active ingredient shall be considered not subject to the
sanitizer exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has not provided the same exemption for small sanitizer facilities in the BPT, BAT and BCT regulations. EPA has
evaluated whether this would be appropriate, but could find no basis for expanding the exemption. The BPT requirements
have covered all PFPR waste streams since those requirements were issued in 1978, and EPA believes there is no reason
to relax those requirements. However, EPA invites comments on this issue. The Agency would consider revising the
BPT, BCT and BAT regulations to be consistent with the PSES standards with respect to the small sanitizer facilities
exemption if new information and comments indicate that extending that exemption to the direct discharger facilities
would be appropriate (i.e., based on the ability to relieve significant impacts on small direct discharge entities
while sacrificing only a small number of toxic-weighted pounds). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion of the Options considered reflects estimated costs and loadings for the wastewater generated
from formulating, packaging or repackaging the 272 active ingredients only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1 is estimated to cost $33.6 million annually for the 2400 facilities analyzed, and would remove an estimated
111,653 pounds of active ingredients per year. EPA's analysis of the impacts of these costs projects that eleven plants
would close and 189 plants would discontinue their pesticides production (i.e. would have line conversions). EPA's
estimates are based on the cost required to install a Universal Treatment System, including one or more of the identified
Universal Treatment System control technologies and holding tanks, pumps, and piping as needed. For ease of analysis,
EPA assumed conservatively that this cost would be imposed on all facilities that currently discharge to POTW's and
that no existing facilities would have any savings due to treatment already in place. EPA estimated costs on a plant-by-plant
basis for all plants surveyed that reported discharge of process wastewater to a POTW. Although there are a small number
of surveyed facilities that reported treating their wastewater prior to discharging it to a POTW, in most cases this
treatment was not intended to control active ingredients. For the majority of facilities, EPA costed treatment technology
(and equipment to accomplish recycle and reuse as needed) for the total volume reported in the questionnaire as being
discharged currently. For facilities that are engaged in both pesticide manufacturing and formulating, packaging
or repackaging EPA assumed that costs would be incurred for PFPR wastewater treatment and recycle and reuse equipment
believed to be needed beyond the equipment these facilities already have in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1 was rejected because it does not incorporate any recycle or water conservation, pollution prevention techniques
that are widely demonstrated and practiced in this industry. Therefore, it does not represent the best available
technology. Also, the Agency would be unable to control the discharge of all pollutants due to a lack of analytical
methods for some active ingredients. EPA also notes that Option 1 would require significant additional data on a large
number of pollutants for which the Agency would have to establish standards and for which facilities would need to
monitor. EPA did consider setting standards for one or more pollutants that could be used as surrogates for the active
ingredients and other priority pollutants. The Agency considered, for example, using immunoassays as a less expensive
alternate method for demonstrating compliance. EPA performed tests using these immunoassay techniques as written
up in Environmental Lab; June/July 1993, Vol. 5, Number 3, page 27. As stated in this article, the immunoassay tests
appear to work reasonably well if the monitoring involves a relatively small number of analytes overall.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, since there are only a few ingredient-specific immunoassay tests available, EPA does not consider this
method of determining compliance to be feasible at present. EPA also considered the possibility of using Total Organic
Carbon (TOC) or the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as measures of the performance of wastewater treatment in removing
active ingredients and other pollutants. This alternative was also rejected because it would be very difficult to
establish a specific concentration of TOC or COD that would reflect adequate treatment and removal of the active ingredients
and other pollutants for all of the diverse wastewater matrices found at pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging
facilities. Lastly, the Agency gave some consideration to a measurement of the toxicity of the wastewater. This was
also rejected, because toxicity measurements are in no way specific to any given pollutant and they are not expected
to be sensitive at the levels that represent good wastewater treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To alleviate the burden associated with monitoring for each specific regulated pollutant would have required EPA
to identify a suitable surrogate pollutant in each case for formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities, which
was not possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2 is estimated to cost $28.7 million annually for the 2400 facilities, and would be expected to remove 111,683
pounds of active ingredients per year. The estimated costs for Option 2 are slightly lower than the estimated costs
for Option 1, due to a lower volume of wastewater that is expected to be treated by the Universal Treatment System. Since
EPA believes that wastewater from rinsing the interior of shipping containers can be directly added to the product
being formulated, EPA has estimated that no cost is associated with the recycle of this stream. EPA has estimated the
cost of holding the rinsate from cleaning equipment interiors and bulk storage tanks. This cost is based on the greatest
volume expected to be generated over a 90 day period. EPA has assumed that facilities will hold these wastewater sources
no longer than 90 days in order to avoid the possibility of being classified a RCRA waste storage facility, and separate
holding tanks to avoid cross-contamination of wastewater were costed for each product the facility reported making.
If there is a gap in production of greater than 90-days based on the reported production schedule for a given product
it was assumed that the volume would be combined with other pesticide process wastewater for treatment through the
Universal Treatment System. Generally, wastewater volumes from interior cleaning were costed for recycle only
and were not part of the hydraulic load that was costed for treatment through the Universal Treatment System. Therefore
the Universal Treatment System can be smaller than the system costed for Option 1. EPA estimates that the economic
impact of Option 2 would be one possible plant closure and 192 line conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2 was rejected even though it does incorporate pollution prevention practices, because it does not represent
the best available technologies, i.e. the best performance of facilities in this subcategory. In addition, EPA would
still need to establish standards for a long list of pollutants and there would still be some pollutants for which the
discharge would be uncontrolled. As discussed previously an estimated 669 of the 1305 PFPR (not including refilling
establishments) facilities are achieving zero discharge. EPA generally could find no significant difference between
facilities that use but do not discharge wastewater versus facilities that do discharge. There is generally no significant
difference in production processes, volumes produced, type of products made, active ingredients used, geographic
location or any other factor. Therefore, Option 2 for PSES was also rejected because it would allow a discharge and
thus result in largely inconsistent requirements for PSES compared to BPT/BAT for direct dischargers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3 is also estimated to cost $28.7 million annually for the 2400 facilities and result in one plant closure and
188 product line closures or conversions. However Option 3 is estimated to remove 111,996 pounds per year of active
ingredient pollutants. As discussed previously, EPA has proposed to select not Option 3 but a variation of Option
3 in which the costs and economic impacts associated are reduced for the small sanitizer facilities. (See Section
XIV of this preamble for more detailed discussion). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Options 4 and 5 were rejected because they rely on transferring wastewater pollutants to other media as part of their
approach. In addition their very high cost would result in greater economic impacts on many facilities. Option 4 is
estimated to cost $290 million and Option 5 is estimated to cost $364 million for the 2400 facilities. The projected
economic impacts include 8 plant closures for both Options with 193 product line closures or conversions for Option
4 and 230 product line closures or conversions for Option 5. It should be noted that there are small numbers of facilities
that could find it less expensive to practice pollution prevention on the interior cleaning wastewaters and send
the rest of their pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater off-site for disposal than it will
be for them to install a treatment system to handle these wastes. EPA is providing suggestions for handling wastewaters
and treating and/or recycling them in an efficient, low-cost manner such that these facilities can be dissuaded from
opting to transfer wastewater pollutants to other media. (See Technical Development Document for details.)

2. Cost Estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimated industry-wide costs for these five options by estimating costs on a plant-by-plant basis for the 707
facilities involved in the survey. These costs were used to estimate costs for the 2400 facilities that are represented
by the survey. Each of the surveyed facilities that use and discharge wastewater to the POTW was costed for each option.
For the second phase of the evaluation (facilities processing both the 272 and the non-272 active ingredients) additional
costs were determined based on the survey responses. For facilities processing only the non-272 active ingredients,
costs were estimated based on the results of costing compliance with the proposed rule for the 2400 facilities for
which the detailed information was developed. Based on the additional 1500 facilities processing only the non-272
PAIs, as identified in the FIFRA data base, and taking into account the estimated number of these facilities that would
already be at zero discharge based on the surveyed population of facilities, 311 of the 1500 PFPR facilities were estimated
to incur costs. This is proportional to the 507 PFPR facilities which were costed in the costing evaluation for the
272 PAIs. Since the practices and types of products are expected to be the same for facilities processing both the 272
active ingredients in the survey data base and the other active ingredients (non-272 active ingredients) covered
by the proposed rule, the distribution of costs was estimated to be the same for both populations of facilities. Including
the additional costs for the 311 PFPR facilities to formulate, package, and/or repackage non-272 PAIs, the additional
annualized cost associated with the extended coverage of the proposed rule for PFPR facilities is $20.5 million,
with 818 PFPR facilities incurring costs. EPA also estimated that there could be an additional 13 manufacturing/formulating,
packaging and repackaging facilities that make products containing only non-272 active ingredients. Using the
same approach as above EPA estimates there may be a cost of $5.8 million annualized cost associated with their compliance,
and an additional $3.7 million annualized cost for the original 22 PFPR/manufacturers. This results in a total annualized
cost of $56.1 million for the proposed option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the detailed costing evaluation for the 2439 out of the 3879 facilities, EPA began by establishing
a hierarchy with which to estimate the costs for all wastewaters.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;EPA assumes that any wastewater stream achieving zero discharge to surface waters as of 1988 would not be affected
by these regulations and so no additional cost was included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any wastewater stream generated by rinsing drums or shipping containers is assumed to be reused in product
formulations without storage at no additional cost to the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wastewater streams generated by rinsing bulk storage containers are assumed to be temporarily stored and
later reused on site. Facilities would incur costs associated with this storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wastewater streams generated by cleaning the interiors of pesticide formulating and packaging equipment
are assumed to be temporarily stored and later reused in product formulation where possible, or treated (as discussed
below) and reused on site. Facilities would incur costs associated with this storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wastewater contained in waste streams that are generated by cleaning pesticide formulating and packaging
equipment with both water and solvent streams is assumed to be kept separate from the solvent and treated and reused
on site. When switching from a solvent to a water-based product a facility typically rinses the equipment first with
the solvent, (which can be reused in the next formulation) followed by a water rinse. Although this water rinse may
contain small quantities of solvent, the Agency believes this water can be treated on-site and reused. Facilities
would incur costs associated with this treatment and storage.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the selected regulatory approach wastewater generated from cleaning out the interiors would be reused as diluent
in the next batch of the same product to be formulated, thus recovering the product value of this wastewater. However,
some facilities reported cleaning equipment interiors in a way that may preclude the wastewater's reuse. The Agency
believes that these facilities can change their cleaning practices or change their equipment configurations such
that they will be able to reuse these waste streams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Without the facility-specific information needed to assess how each facility might do this, the Agency has taken
the following approach to costing for these interior waste streams. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Organic based Solvents used for cleaning are not expected to be discharged to a POTW and are not included in the
estimates of cost. EPA's survey data base indicates that companies generally prefer for cost or other reasons to keep
solvents separate from wastewaters and not discharge them to POTWs. Often companies can reuse solvents or burn or
sell them for their fuel content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cleaning with inert materials (besides water) or mechanical cleaning (e.g. scraping) are not expected to
result in a wastewater source and are not included in the estimates of cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cleaning water that is currently being recycled or reused is already complying with the regulatory approach
and therefore is not included in the estimates of cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cleaning water that is disposed of off-site and not to a POTW is already complying with the regulatory approach
in that it is not discharged directly to surface waters or indirectly through a POTW and therefore is not included in
the estimates of cost.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of cleaning the interior of equipment with water only, the following factors were also considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Lines that do not formulate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is assumed that wastewater generated by cleaning lines that are not used to formulate products (i.e., those lines
used exclusively for packaging or repackaging pesticide product) is unable to be reused directly in product formulations,
since no pesticide products are formulated on these lines. These waste streams were costed for treatment and reuse
or off-site incineration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Lines that handle dry or emulsifiable concentrate products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On lines where emulsifiable concentrates were formulated and packaged, wastewater generated from cleaning equipment
interiors was assumed not to be reusable in the product. Since it is impossible to determine the portion of water generated
on the line which is due to only these emulsifiable concentrate products, EPA assumed that all the water reported for
those lines could not be reused. Therefore, formulation and packaging lines producing either emulsifiable concentrate
or dry products were costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Toll or contract formulating. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Facilities that generate water during cleaning and are toll or contract formulators (i.e., the facility provides
the formulating and packaging of the pesticide products as a service) may not have a consistent base of production.
EPA assumes that they may not make a product more than once in any given time period and therefore may not be able to reuse
cleaning water directly into product formulations. Therefore, toll or contract formulation and packaging facilities
were costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Lines that have a break in operations greater than 90 days. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wastewater generated from cleaning equipment interiors that will not be used to formulate that product for more than
90 days (i.e., the facility reported that the line was not producing pesticide products during four or more consecutive
months in 1988) could be affected by RCRA or similar state storage rules. EPA assumed that a portion of the water generated
on the line is unable to be reused in product formulation. This was costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some lines produced pesticide during only one period in the year. In these cases, EPA assumed that equal volumes of
water would be generated for each cleaning; therefore, the total volume was divided by the number of occurrences to
determine the volume of water generated during each cleaning. This volume was used to estimate the cost of treatment
and reuse or off-site disposal of the last cleanout performed. The remaining volume of water was costed for storage
and direct reuse back into the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some lines may be unable to reuse untreated water. All interior cleaning water from these lines was costed for treatment
and reuse or off-site incineration along with the facilities' non-interior process wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. Lines that have special cleaning operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some facilities generate wastewater from special cleaning operations, as opposed to routine or product changeover
cleaning, and have more than one product on the line. (Lines with only one product are assumed to be able to reuse water
directly in the product formulation.) In situations where these lines handle the same active ingredients in all the
products, EPA assumed the cleaning wastewaters could be reused directly in the product formulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other facilities may have some difficulty reusing water from these operations directly into product formulations
with their current practices. Special cleanings are presumed to be unplanned and may result in large quantities of
wastewaters that are contaminated by multiple products. In these cases, the special cleaning water was costed for
treatment and reuse or off-site incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f. Lines that generate more volume than could potentially be reused in the product. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the available information, EPA believes some facilities may generate more water from cleaning operations
than could be reused. EPA used the following approach to estimate this under the following conditions:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The pounds of active ingredient reported to be in the product were calculated. The percent of active ingredient(s)
provided by the facility in Section 3 of the questionnaire was used to determine this value: (Total Pounds Produced
&times; Total % Active Ingredient)=Total Pounds Active Ingredient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The calculated pounds of active ingredient were subtracted from the total pounds of product to determine the pounds
of inert ingredients (especially diluent): (Total Pounds Produced ^ Pound of Active Ingredient)=Pounds of Inert
Ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The pounds of inert ingredients remaining were converted to gallons: (Pounds of Inert Ingredients/8.34 pounds/gallons)=Gallons
of Inert Ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assume that cleaning water could be used to make up 50 percent of this volume: (Gallons of Inert Ingredients &times;
50 percent)=Gallons of water that can be reused.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Compare this value to the volume of interior equipment cleaning wastewater generated on the line: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For: Gallons of water that can be reused &gt; Total interior equipment cleaning, water is costed for reuse in the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For: Gallons of water that can be reused " Total interior equipment cleaning, water is costed for treatment and reuse
or off-site incineration.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Lines with multiple cleaning sequences and different steps in each sequence, often mixing water with other
steps such as abrasives or detergents, were costed for off-site disposal or treatment and reuse. This is because the
effect of using the abrasives or detergents along with water to clean equipment results in adding a contaminant to
the wastewater that is not a constituent of the product and could thus render the wastewater incompatible for direct
product recovery and reuse without treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lines with detergent solutions used to clean the interiors of equipment were costed for treatment and reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lines in which the water used to clean equipment interiors becomes contaminated with solvents also used on
the same line were costed for treatment and reuse.

All other wastewater streams (``non-interior streams'') are assumed to be treated and reused on-site or hauled for
off-site incineration, depending on the option costed. EPA's cost model for wastewater treatment was initially
based on the model used to estimate costs for the pesticide manufacturers rulemaking effort. EPA refined that model
to enable costs and loadings to be estimated for all water-using pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging
facilities in the surveyed population.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Universal Treatment System identified as BAT/PSES technology, and assumed in the cost model to be required, consists
in part, of raw wastewater storage tanks. Storage tank capacity was costed to hold as much volume as is assumed to be
generated during three months or the facility's maximum wastewater volume generated at one time in 1988, whichever
volume is larger. The system also includes a jacketed process treatment vessel in which emulsion breaking, chemical
oxidation, sulfide precipitation and hydrolysis will take place, an activated carbon system consisting of a feed
storage tank, a grit pre-filter, a three-bed adsorber unit (and, if size required, a backwash system), and effluent
storage tanks equal in capacity to the raw wastewater storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of pesticide manufacturing treatability data reveals that activated carbon, chemical oxidation, and hydrolysis
are the most common BAT technologies used to treat pesticide active ingredients. These technologies are expected
to be capable of treating any and all active ingredients in PFPR waste streams to levels that will allow recycle/reuse
and thus would result in zero discharge of wastewaters. (See previous discussion of the Universal Treatment System
treatability study.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The model calculates costs for BAT under the assumption that hydrolysis and chemical oxidation are carried out only
when required (based upon the treatability information for each active ingredient available from the pesticide
manufacturer rule database or data transfers as described previously in Section V). Emulsion breaking pretreatment
and activated carbon adsorption, however, are always assumed to be carried out on the wastewater and therefore their
costs are always included. This approach is conservative, because it is likely that not all facilities will need to
use emulsion breaking to treat their wastewaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The input data required by the cost model consist of facility-specific wastewater flow data, facility-specific
influent active ingredient concentration data, active ingredient treatability data, and active ingredient analytical
method data. These data are used to calculate current and proposed active ingredient loadings, to size and cost the
treatment system, and to cost monitoring of the treated wastewater. The flow data were obtained from the PFPR questionnaire
responses. The concentration data were obtained from EPA sampling at seven PFPR facilities. Both sets of data are
stored in the pesticide formulating data base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost model determines the quarterly wastewater volumes and the maximum wastewater volume needing treatment
at any one time. These values are used to size the raw wastewater storage tanks in the Universal Treatment System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Active ingredient loadings were estimated on a stream-by-stream basis by first identifying the active ingredients
that could be in each stream and then extrapolating sampling data to set an influent concentration for each active
ingredient in each stream. It was assumed that each active ingredient contained in the pesticide product would be
contained in the wastewater streams generated by the production line for that product. It was also assumed that all
active ingredients formulated, packaged or repackaged by each facility would be in the facility's non-line specific
wastewater streams. The concentration of each active ingredient in the facility's commingled wastewater was then
estimated by dividing the sum of the stream-specific loadings for each active ingredient by the total facility pesticide
formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The active ingredient concentrations for each stream were extrapolated from the sampling data in the pesticide formulating,
packaging or repackaging analytical database (and were sorted by stream type and active ingredient). Due to the lack
of concentration data for numerous active ingredients in the process wastewater streams, concentration values
were extrapolated from available active ingredient stream data to other active ingredients within that particular
stream type for which no characterization data exist. The following methodology was used:

&bull;Active ingredient concentration data were transferred to structurally similar active ingredients for the
same source of wastewater; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Median values of all the active ingredient concentration data points for the same stream type were transferred
to all remaining active ingredients lacking characterization data.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The median active ingredient concentrations are assumed to reasonably reflect what is likely to be found in the wastewater.
To check this, comparison was made of the calculated load of the commingled waste streams based on the median concentration
values and the actual loading observed in the wastewater samples at two sampled facilities. The two values were reasonably
close. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The active ingredient treatability data used in the cost model were principally taken from the pesticide manufacturers
data base or from treatability studies as described previously under the discussion of data transfers. The following
methodology was applied:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Active ingredients with pesticide manufacturing BAT technologies of hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, or
activated carbon adsorption (the technologies used in the ``Universal Treatment System'') were assumed to be treated
by these technologies in the cost model, to the same effluent concentrations set under the manufacturing rulemaking
(58 FR 50637). This assumption results in conservative cost estimates since the sampling data from the PFPR facilities
that are treating to recycle their wastewater sometimes had higher concentrations of pollutants in their treated
wastewater than the manufacturing limits would have allowed, yet they still reuse their treated wastewater in various
non-interior process related uses.

&bull;For pesticide active ingredients (PAIs) that have pesticide manufacturing limitations which are based on
one of the UTS technologies (i.e., activated carbon, hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, chemical precipitation),
achievable effluent concentrations were based on LTA concentrations from data derived from the development of the
pesticide manufacturing effluent limitations guidelines. When pesticide manufacturing limitations existed
but were not based on one of the UTS technologies mentioned above, treatability data for one of the UTS technologies
was used to back up the manufacturing LTA concentration. When pesticide manufacturing limitations did not exist,
EPA transferred LTA concentration data within strutural groups (using the highest LTA in the strutural group). When
there was no LTA for any PAI within a given strutural group, EPA transferred the 90th percentile highest LTA, which
means that 90% of the PAIs with manufacturing limits have LTAs less than the transferred limit.

EPA estimated costs for monitoring active ingredient concentrations for Options 1,2,3 and 3/S. Option 3 and 3/S (and
3S.1) would not require monitoring of pollutant concentrations to demonstrate compliance. However, the Agency
assumes facilities may monitor wastewater after treatment and before recycling or reusing it to ensure it has been
adequately treated. To be conservative EPA has assumed all facilities will incur this monitoring cost. In actuality,
many facilities do not perform analyses to determine active ingredient concentrations. However, they usually do
perform some type of quality check. It can vary from visual inspection to measuring a parameter such as density, COD
or TSS to actually measuring the concentration of the active ingredient as done by some large facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA estimated the number of days each facility discharged in 1988 as well as the number of days each facility would discharge
under the proposed regulatory options. Because the number of discharge days was not provided by pesticide formulating,
packaging or repackaging facilities in the questionnaire, EPA estimated 1988 discharge days based on the number
of days that facilities operated their individual pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging lines in 1988.
Facilities reported the number of days each line was used to produce pesticide products in 1988 and which months each
line was in operation, but did not report the total number of days that the entire pesticide formulating, packaging
or repackaging facility was in operation. In order to account for overlap when a facility operated multiple lines
producing pesticide products during the same days, EPA compared the total number of days reported for all pesticide
formulating, packaging or repackaging lines at each facility with 22 days per month for each month the facility was
in operation (assumes most facilities operated five days per week). EPA then selected the smallest of these estimations
to be the number of discharge days. For the two proposed discharge options, facilities are assumed to discharge wastewater,
at a minimum, once per each calendar quarter that they are in operation.

B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments Whose Principal Business Is Retail
Sales (Subcategory E) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today proposing to establish pretreatment standards for refilling establishments that repackage agricultural
pesticide products based on achieving zero discharge of wastewater pollutants to POTWs. Using the same approach
to evaluating the pass through of wastewater pollutants as is discussed for Subcategory C, EPA expects that the pesticide
active ingredient pollutants present in process wastewaters from refilling operations will pass through POTW's.
As with pass through analysis for Subcategory C, an optimistic estimate of 50 percent removal of active ingredients
using well-operated secondary treatment at POTWs does not come close to matching 100 percent removal achieved by
the proposed BAT level treatment. As with Subcategory C, EPA assumes that the active ingredient will always be present
in the wastewater from refilling establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The best available technology identified for this proposal is secondary containment of bulk storage areas and loading
pads, plus the collection and holding of rinsates, contaminated stormwater and leaks and spills. The Agency's Office
of Pesticide Programs has proposed a regulation under FIFRA that would require refilling establishments for agricultural
pesticides to build secondary containment structures and loading pads to certain specifications (59 FR 6712, February
11, 1994). Of the estimated 1134 facilities (based on the 1988 survey) that would be affected by today's proposal,
EPA's questionnaire responses indicate that 98 percent or an estimated 1101 already achieve zero discharge, primarily
by holding contaminated wastewater and reusing it as make-up water. Thus, this practice not only eliminates the discharge
of wastewater but also allows the facility to recover the value of the product in the wastewater. The average volume
of wastewater discharged by refilling establishments is estimated to be 78 gallons per year per facility. EPA assumes
volumes of this magnitude can be held in a minibulk container until such a time as it can be reused. EPA estimates the
cost of a minibulk container to be about $300 capital investment. EPA finds the costs are economically achievable
(see Section XIV).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to establish NSPS as zero discharge, equivalent to the BAT requirements for existing sources. Zero
discharge represents best available and best demonstrated technology for the pesticide formulating, packaging
and repackaging subcategory as a whole. The economic impact analysis for existing sources shows that this regulatory
approach (termed Option 3 in the discussion above) would be economically achievable for the industry. EPA believes
that new sources will be able to comply at costs that are similar to or less than the costs for existing sources, because
new sources can apply control technologies (including dedicated lines and pressurized hoses for equipment cleaning)
more efficiently than sources that need to retrofit for those technologies. EPA's analysis concludes that a zero
discharge requirement for new source direct dischargers would be economically achievable and would not be a barrier
to entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to set pretreatment standards for new sources (which cover indirect dischargers) equivalent to
the NSPS standards (which cover direct dischargers), i.e., at zero discharge for all PFPR waste streams. For the reasons
stated above with respect to the NSPS standards, EPA finds that the PSNS regulations would be economically achievable
and not a barrier to entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA has proposed to exempt the non-interior waste streams of the small sanitizers from this zero discharge
requirement for existing pretreatment facilities (PSES), EPA is not proposing to include this same exemption for
the new source pretreatment facilities (PSNS). The rationale for finding that the exemption for those sanitizer
waste streams is appropriate for existing sources is based on EPA's findings that the impacts on existing small entities
would be significantly reduced by the exemption while the associated additional loading of toxic pollutants would
be small. With respect to new source pretreaters, EPA does not have sufficient information to conclude that the size
and economic conditions of those new sources, the impacts on those new sources, and the associated loadings of toxic
pollutants, would justify a similar exemption for the non-interior waste streams for sanitizer facilities. EPA
solicits comments on these conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA has proposed to set a zero discharge requirement for NSPS, also without any exemption for sanitizers'
waste streams, based on the proposal to set BAT at zero discharge for all waste streams and the finding that NSPS should
be set at a level at least as stringent as BAT. EPA has stated elsewhere in today's preamble that, based on comments and
new information, it would consider varying the final rule to exempt the sanitizers' non-interior waste streams in
the BAT regulations as well as in the PSES standards. Even if EPA were to do so, it would be likely that NSPS would still
be set at zero discharge without any exemption for sanitizers, for the reasons discussed above as to why EPA is not proposing
to include an exemption for sanitizers in the PSNS regulations.

EPA's economic impact assessment is set forth in the report titled ``Economic Impact Analysis of Proposed Effluent
Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Pesticide Formulating, Packaging, and Repackaging Industry'' (hereinafter
``EIA''). This report estimates the economic effect of compliance with the proposed regulation in terms of facility
closures, conversions of production lines to alternate activities, and compliance costs as a percentage of facility
revenues. Firm-level impacts, local community impacts, international trade effects, effects on new pesticide
formulating, packaging, and repackaging (PFPR) facilities, and estimates of the cost savings of pollution prevention
techniques are also presented. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis detailing the small business impacts for this
industry is also included in the EIA. In addition, EPA conducted an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the regulatory
options. The report, ``Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Proposed Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards
of Performance for the Pesticide Formulating/Packaging/Repackaging Industry'' is included in the record of this
rule-making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, projection of economic impacts relies heavily on the responses to the questionnaire distributed
to PFPR facilities by EPA under the authority of Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. EPA sent the questionnaire, requesting
both technical and economic information, to 707 facilities, representing 3,241 facilities in the population. (See
Section V.A.2 for details.) Data from the questionnaires are used to project economic impacts for PFPR facilities
using one or more of the 272 pesticide active ingredients (PAIs) or classes of PAIs that were the focus of the survey.
As previously mentioned, based on results from the survey, quantitative estimates of PFPR activities were computed
for the entire U.S. population of PFPR facilities using the original 272 PAIs considered for regulation. The remainder
of the discussion of economic impacts will report only these national stratified estimates, unless otherwise indicated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also performed analyses and developed population-level estimates encompassing the additional PAIs not on the
original list of 272 PAIs studied for regulation. The results from these analyses are reported in Preamble Section
XIV.L., Assessment of Economic Impacts Including Additional PAIs Not on the Original List of 272 PAIs Studied for
Regulation. Except in that section of the Preamble, the economic impact estimates presented in this section pertain
only to the use of the 272 PAIs originally studied for regulation. In section XIV.L., the discussion of impact estimates
includes the additional (non-272) PAIs to distinguish the findings that encompass the additional PAIs from those
presented elsewhere that pertain to the original list of 272 PAIs studied for regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of 272 PAIs on which this detailed analysis is based matches the list of PAIs considered for regulation in the
recent effluent guidelines rulemaking for the pesticide manufacturing industry. (See Section V.A for the derivation
of the list of the 272 PAIs.) However, EPA believes that the financial characteristics of the facilities surveyed
on the basis of using one or more of the 272 PAIs are representative of the entire PFPR industry, regardless of the particular
active ingredients that a facility formulates, packages, or repackages. Based on the responses to the survey, an
estimated 2,439 population facilities remained in the PFPR business as of 1990 (the year the Section 308 Economic
Survey was conducted). An estimated 1,806 facilities both operate in the PFPR business and use water in their PFPR
operations. Six hundred fifty-two of these facilities also discharge PFPR wastewater either directly to bodies
of water or to POTWs. These water discharging facilities may be subject to cost increases as a result of today's proposed
effluent limitations guidelines and standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the questionnaire, the 598 facilities for which costs of complying with PSES were estimated all discharge
to POTWs. PSES regulations are proposed for two subcategories based on technical and economic differences exhibited
between the subcategories: Subcategory C applies to wastewaters containing any pesticide active ingredients (PAIs)
except for sodium hypochlorite. Within Subcategory C, a subgroup of chemicals is defined for certain PAIs which are
used as sanitizers.

The term ``sanitizer'' is being defined for the purpose of this effluent guideline regulation and is not intended
to classify sanitizers as no longer being pesticides, other than for the purposes of distinguishing their requirements
under this regulation. Also, some PAIs other than those PAIs listed in Table 8 of the regulation may be used as sanitizers.

The second subcategory, Subcategory E, applies to the wastewater streams generated by refilling establishments
that repackage agricultural chemicals and whose principal business is retail sales. The economic basis for creating
the subcategories is discussed in the methodology section below. Many other factors including differences in raw
materials, geographic locations, plant age, etc. are considered when the Agency subcategorizes an industry. These
other factors are discussed in detail in Section 4 of the Technical Development Document.

1. Impact Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIA examines three categories of economic impacts that may result from regulation: Facility closures, conversion
of PFPR product lines to non-PFPR operations, and compliance costs in excess of five percent of facility revenue.
Facility closure is the most severe of the three impacts evaluated. Consistent with the analysis in other effluent
guidelines rulemakings, compliance costs that are less than five percent of facility revenue are judged to be economically
achievable (see, for example, the EIAs for effluent limitations for the OCPSF and pesticide manufacturing industries).
However, it is assumed that compliance costs equal to five percent or more of facility revenue do not necessarily indicate
a significant impact, such as an operational change at a facility. This ratio is counted as a moderate economic impact
as a conservative measure of the possibility of such an impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projections of these economic impacts are based on economic models that estimate pre- and post-compliance costs,
revenues, and quantities for individual facilities. The individual facility impacts are projected using a combination
of data from the 1988 Survey Questionnaire and secondary sources (e.g., Robert Morris Associates Annual Statement
Studies, Dun and Bradstreet's Million Dollar Directory, Standard and Poor's Price Index Record). In addition, impact
projections rely on facility-specific compliance cost estimates developed by the Agency (see Section X of today's
notice). Impact projections are first made for surveyed facilities and then extrapolated to the facility population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facility financial viability is first analyzed in the baseline (pre-compliance) scenario by calculating the three-year
after-tax cash flow from the Survey data. If a facility has lost cash on average over the three-year period, the facility
is not expected to continue in operation and post-compliance impacts are not evaluated, i.e., the facility is considered
to be a baseline closure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Application of the Impact Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The particular impacts evaluated for a facility are a function of the type of PFPR operations conducted at the facility
as well as the percentage of the facility's revenue that is derived from PFPR operations. These characteristics are
used as indicators of the likely response of management to compliance costs. The impact measures used in the analysis
are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Subcategory C Facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain PFPR facilities regulated under Subcategory C are expected to be the most likely to consider facility closure
as a response to the regulation. In particular, PFPR facilities that also manufacture PAIs and facilities earning
a significant percentage of their revenue from PFPR activities are assumed to be the likeliest facilities to consider
closure as the alternative to compliance with the regulation. PFPR facilities that also manufacture PAIs (hereafter
``PFPR/Manufacturing facilities'') generally obtain a high percentage of their revenue from PFPR activities.
Based on responses to the 1988 Survey questionnaire, the mean percentage of facility revenue from PFPR activities
was 54 percent for PFPR/Manufacturing facilities, with a median value of 38 percent. In addition, the manufacturing
operations are integrated with the PFPR operations and additional costs may be incurred in manufacturing operations
(e.g., tolling costs) if PFPR operations are shut down.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners of PFPR facilities that do not manufacture PAIs might also consider closing entirely rather than converting
their PFPR lines if PFPR activities constitute a substantial portion of their business. The analysis assumes that
facilities that obtain at least 25 percent of their revenue from PFPR activities will consider closing entirely.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This fairly low percentage of revenue was chosen so that evaluation of the most severe economic impact_facility closure_includes
all facilities that might consider this alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Ideally, the determination of whether management would consider closing a facility entirely would be based on the
percentage of profit, rather than revenue, derived from PFPR activities. However, because costs were not reported
for PFPR activities in the Survey, calculation of PFPR profits is not possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Facilities regulated under Subcategory C that do not manufacture PAIs and that obtain less than 25 percent of their
revenue from PFPR activities are expected to respond differently to compliance costs. These facilities frequently
engage in the formulating and packaging of many non-pesticide products as well as pesticide products. The facilities
are typically not dependant on pesticide FPR, but may include pesticides in the line of many chemical preparations
that they formulate, package, and repackage. The production lines are not usually specific to pesticides, but can
formulate, package, or repackage a wide range of products. Therefore, the facilities are more likely to consider
converting their PFPR lines to produce non-pesticide products than closing the facility or the lines if PFPR production
is discontinued. The analysis evaluates whether these facilities would, in fact, be expected to convert their pesticide
lines to other formulating/packaging/repackaging operations as a result of the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional measure of economic effects on facilities regulated under Subcategory C, the annualized compliance
costs are compared to facility revenue for each facility. As discussed above, projected annualized compliance costs
that are less than five percent of facility revenue are taken to indicate that the facility will not experience significant
economic impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Subcategory E Facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For refilling establishments, the only economic measure evaluated is compliance costs as a percentage of revenue.
Refilling establishments constitute a distinct set of facilities within the PFPR industry. An estimated 47 percent
of the facilities potentially covered by the PFPR regulation are classified as Subcategory E facilities. These facilities
do not formulate or package pesticides, but maintain at least one bulk storage tank for pesticides and distribute
the formulated product in refillable containers to farmers. Most refilling establishments surveyed reported a
primary SIC code of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5191, which characterizes the establishments as ``primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of animal feeds,
fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, pesticides, seeds, and other farm supplies, except grains.'' In keeping
with this line of business, typical ownership of refilling establishments differs from that of other PFPR facilities.
An estimated 29 percent of refilling establishments are owned as a cooperative, e.g., a group of farmers who purchase
and distribute pesticide among themselves. (See Table 1.) In contrast, only an estimated two percent of other PFPR
facilities have a cooperative form of ownership.

Generally, refilling establishments have lower total revenues than other PFPR facilities. The estimated mean annual
revenue for refilling establishments was less than $5 million, while other PFPR facilities have an estimated mean
revenue of over $16 million. Further, refilling establishments derive only a small percentage of their revenue from
pesticide repackaging. The estimated mean percentage of revenue from pesticide refilling activities is 15 percent,
while other PFPR facilities have a mean percentage of revenue from PFPR activities of 28 percent. Also, the other activities
conducted at refilling establishments do not depend on repackaging pesticides. Therefore, for this subcategory,
no facility closures are expected in response to compliance costs imposed by this rulemaking and no further analysis
of facility closure has been conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refilling establishments have simple production lines, typically consisting of one or more bulk tanks purchased
specifically to hold pesticides. The investment in the ``production line'' is minimal and alternative uses of the
tank are limited and unlikely to provide significant profits. Therefore, most owners of refilling establishments
are not expected to discontinue their refilling practices for the purpose of converting their tanks to an alternate
use and no analysis of production line conversion has been conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic returns to refilling establishments may, however, be affected by compliance with the proposed regulation.
The analysis evaluates the extent of potential impacts by comparing annualized compliance costs to facility revenue.
Costs in excess of five percent of the facility's revenue are characterized as a possible significant economic impact.

a. Baseline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The baseline economic analysis evaluates each facility's financial operating condition prior to incurring compliance
costs for this regulation. The purpose of the baseline analysis is to identify PFPR facilities that are currently
experiencing or are projected to experience significant financial stress following the period for which the Survey
was completed. These facilities are having or are expected to have serious financial difficulties regardless of
the promulgation of effluent guidelines. Attribution of these financial difficulties to the effluent guidelines
rather than to facilities' current financial problems would inaccurately represent the burden of the effluent guidelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facility financial viability is analyzed in the baseline scenario by calculating the three-year after-tax cash
flow from the Survey data, incorporating the costs of EPA regulations effective after the Survey was administered.
If a facility has lost cash on average over the three-year period, the facility is not expected to continue in operation
and post-compliance impacts are not evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This baseline analysis included the estimated costs associated with three significant EPA regulations which were
not in place in 1988 (the base year) and whose costs were therefore not reflected in the annual operating expenses provided
by facilities in the 1988 Survey. These regulations are: (1) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) land disposal
restrictions (40 CFR part 268), (2) effluent limitations for the Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers
(OCPSF) industry (40 CFR part 414), and (3) effluent limitations for the Pesticide Manufacturing Industry (40 CFR
part 455). Also, Congress passed the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Amendments of
1988, most of which became effective in December, 1988. The annual product maintenance fees mandated by the amendments
therefore would not have been included in the Survey responses and are therefore added to facility costs in the baseline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An estimated 18 facilities are projected to incur costs due to the RCRA land disposal restrictions in the baseline
analysis. As a result of the RCRA restrictions, these 18 facilities are expected to incur annualized costs of $156,000,
in 1988 dollars. These costs reflect compliance with land disposal restrictions and include outlays associated
with landfills, surface impoundments, and waste piles. In addition, an estimated 15 facilities are projected to
incur costs due to the OCPSF effluent guidelines in the baseline analysis. The OCPSF guidelines are estimated to impose
annualized costs of $5.4 million, in 1988 dollars, on these 15 facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two effects of effluent guidelines for pesticide manufacturers are included in the analysis. First, a portion of
the compliance costs resulting from the effluent guidelines are expected to be passed on to the PFPR facilities. Therefore,
PFPR facilities are expected to incur higher costs in purchasing PAIs that had costs under the manufacturing rule.
Of the 634 PFPR facilities that discharge water from PFPR operations, 525 are expected to bear such increased costs,
totaling $3.4 million per year. Not all of the compliance costs associated with the pesticide manufacturers effluent
guideline, however, are expected to be passed on to consumers. Therefore, additional annualized costs ($5.6 million)
are added to the baseline for the pesticide manufacturer facilities that also PFPR. Finally, all pesticide producing
establishments must pay annual FIFRA maintenance fees. These fees are not expected to result in capital costs, but
annual operating costs borne by the facilities are expected to increase by $3.0 million (1988).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Post-compliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For this EIA, a PFPR facility is defined as all operations conducted at a facility that formulates, packages, or repackages
pesticide products. The facility closure analysis is based on an evaluation of baseline and post-compliance facility
after-tax cash flows. Following calculation of baseline after-tax cash flow, projected regulatory costs were added
to the baseline costs. Total post-compliance costs were then used to estimate a post-compliance cash flow. A facility
closure is projected to result from the regulation if the baseline after-tax cash flow is positive and the post-compliance
after-tax cash flow is negative (i.e., if a facility begins to lose cash due to the regulation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In theory, conversion of PFPR production lines would be predicted to occur at the point that the return on the assets
employed in an alternate activity, adjusted for conversion costs, exceed the return from PFPR. The return available
from another activity, however, would vary for each facility based on such factors as local/regional manufacturing
activity, capacity availability, and business connections. However, in general, it is expected that alternate
FPR opportunities exist in the operations characterized by SIC codes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SIC codes for PFPR facilities that obtain less than 25 percent of their revenue from PFPR.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis of product line conversion is based on comparing the return on assets (ROA) that would be obtained by continuing
PFPR in the post-compliance scenario with the ROA that could be obtained from operating activities classified in
SIC 2842. (This data is not available for SIC 2899.) The analysis assumes that the ROA achieved by 75 percent of facilities
operating in SIC 2842 could reasonably be expected to be achieved by a converted PFPR line. From 1986 through 1988,
the average lowest quartile ROA was 2.9 percent for SIC 2842 (Robert Morris Associates, Annual Statement Studies).
If a facility's ROA for PFPR falls below 2.9 percent as a result of compliance costs, the facility would be expected
to convert its PFPR production lines to other FPR activities.

EPA evaluated each of the impact measures assuming that the facility is unable to pass any costs through to customers.
This is an extremely conservative assumption that yields maximum projected impacts on PFPR facilities. In fact,
this scenario is highly unlikely. For a zero cost pass-through analysis to represent a realistic scenario, either
the supply curves for pesticide markets must be perfectly inelastic or the demand curves must be perfectly elastic.
A perfectly inelastic supply curve is associated with goods for which there is a fixed supply. This is not the case in
the pesticide market. Based on an analysis of the price elasticity of demand for pesticides conducted for the pesticide
manufacturer EIA, demand for pesticides is generally somewhat inelastic.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because supply curves for the pesticide markets are not known, however, and compliance costs are not estimated in
a manner that can necessarily be associated with specific pesticide products, it is difficult to project the percentage
of the compliance costs that will be passed through to customers. If the analysis shows the regulation to be economically
achievable under an assumption of zero cost pass-through, then it is reasonable to conclude that the regulation would
be economically achievable under a more realistic scenario of partial cost pass-through. A sensitivity analysis
based on partial cost pass-through was also conducted and is presented in Appendix D of the EIA. Estimated impacts
under a partial cost pass-through assumption of 50 percent are expected to be five percent lower than those estimated
under the assumption of zero cost pass-through.

 Original PSES Options 1 through 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Subcategory C facilities, EPA initially analyzed the impacts of five possible regulatory options for PSES. These
five options were previously described in Section X. Of these options, EPA initially decided to propose Option 3 because,
as discussed in Section X, it represents the performance achievable with the best available technology. EPA's analysis
shows that this option is economically achievable and, in fact, results in the fewest impacts among the five options.
(As described below, today's notice proposes a different option, (Option 3/S.1) based on 3/S, which is the same as
Option 3 but includes somewhat different provisions for wastewaters from the formulating, packaging, and repackaging
of a group of PAIs termed the ``sanitizer'' PAIs.)

The estimated facility-level impacts associated with each of the regulatory options are discussed below and presented
in Table 4. In addition, estimated worst-case employment impacts are provided. For a projected facility closure,
all employment at the associated facility is assumed to be lost. In estimating employment losses, facilities projected
to convert their pesticide product lines to formulating, packaging, or repackaging of alternate products are treated
as closing their PFPR lines entirely. All production and non-production employment associated with PFPR is assumed
to be lost. In fact, some or all PFPR employment at such facilities might be retained. Demand and production might shift
to non-pesticide products, unregulated pesticides, or to pesticides for which compliance is less costly. The assumption
that all PFPR production is lost is therefore a worst-case assumption. The examination of whether compliance costs
are greater or less than five percent has not been used to assess employment impacts. As discussed above, this impact
measure is assumed not to lead to an operational change. Under Options 1, 2, and 3 all of the moderate impacts were projected
on the basis of a comparison of post compliance return on assets for PFPR activities with a return assumed to be achievable
in alternative business activities using the same capital equipment (i.e., based on projection of line conversions).
Therefore, employment losses associated with moderate impacts at these facilities are accounted for. For Options
4 and 5, over 85 percent of moderate impacts are projected based on the ROA comparison. Therefore, most moderate impacts
are associated with an employment loss.

i. Impacts of Option 1. There are 578 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 1. One

 A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory C facilities. The
capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring
costs) of complying with Option 1 are estimated to be $79.0 million and $32.6 million, respectively. An estimated
nine Subcategory C facilities are projected to close due to compliance with Option 1. One hundred seventy-one facilities
are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst-case, to be 437
full-time equivalents (FTEs) as a result of the estimated impacts.

C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance,
and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 2 are estimated to be $66.1 and $27.9 million, respectively. One facility
is projected to close due to compliance with Option 2. One hundred seventy facilities are estimated to incur moderate
economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 426 FTEs as a result of the estimated
impacts.

Note that the compliance costs projected for Options 2 and 3 are identical because both options are based on the same
technology. For simplification and because the technology is essentially identical the costs are presented to be
identical. In reality Option 3 costs could be lower than Option 2, because sampling data indicate that facilities
which do treat wastewater for recycling back to the facility do not need to achieve the same degree of pollutant removal
from the wastewater that would be required to comply with numeric standards.

iv. Impacts of Option 4. There are 558 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 4. One
hundred thirteen of these facilities were analyzed for possible facility closure and the remaining 445 were analyzed
for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory
C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance,
and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 4 are estimated to be $18.4 and $286.5 million, respectively. Seven
Subcategory C facilities are estimated to close due to compliance with Option 4. One hundred ninety-three facilities
are estimated to incur moderate impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 1,113 FTEs as
a result of the estimated impacts.

for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory
C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance,
and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 5 are estimated to be $21.0 and $360.2 million, respectively. Seven
Subcategory C facilities are projected to close due to compliance with Option 5. Two hundred seventeen facilities
are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 1,173
FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As shown above, Option 3 is economically achievable when viewed across all Subcategory C facilities. However, EPA
was aware, through discussions with industry, that certain segments of the industry exhibit distinctive technical
and market characteristics. In particular, industry identified the institutional/commercial market for pesticides
as having unique technical and market characteristics. The Agency therefore analyzed whether subgroups of facilities,
defined by major pesticide market, were disproportionately affected and considered whether technical and market
factors distinguished any subgroups in ways that would warrant different regulatory approaches for those subgroups.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impacts were analyzed by market, with market definitions based on responses to Survey question

This analysis indicated that facilities obtaining greater than fifty percent of their 272 PAI pesticide related
revenue from the institutional/commercial (I/C) market bore both a large and disproportionately high percentage
of the impacts under Option 3. Table 5 indicates the distributions by primary market of all facilities projected to
incur costs under Option 3, and of those facilities projected to incur significant economic impacts under Option
3.

 Table 5 shows that, of the 574 facilities expected to incur costs, 267 or about 47 percent of those facilities receive
272&hyph;PAI-related revenue primarily from the I/C market. Moreover, the distribution of significant economic
impacts is even more concentrated in the I/C market facilities. Of the 171 facilities expected to incur significant
economic impacts, 102 or nearly 60 percent receive 272&hyph;PAI-related revenue primarily from the I/C market.

A facility's primary market is the market from which it receives at least fifty percent of its in-scope pesticide revenue.
If no market accounts for at least 50 percent of in-scope pesticide revenue, the facility has no primary market.

concentrated in the institutional/commercial market, EPA next analyzed usage of the 272 PAIs. This analysis found
that the PAI used most frequently by impacted facilities primarily in the I/C market is PAI 56, Hyamine 3500; over 66
percent of these 102 impacted facilities use this PAI. Although several other PAIs were also found to be used with some
frequency by the impacted facilities primarily in the I/C market, none were used by more than 30 percent of these facilities,
or well less than half the frequency of use for PAI 56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking into account both the high frequency of use of Hyamine 3500 (PAI 56) and the fact that the pounds removed are virtually
unchanged by excluding the exterior sanitizer wastestreams (19 additional lb-eq), the Agency decided to examine
less stringent requirements with respect to PAI 56 in its efforts to moderate economic impacts of Option 3 on facilities
in the I/C market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the EIA for the pesticide manufacturers effluent guidelines, EPA defined markets of competing PAIs. This market
definition is more detailed than the broad markets listed in the Survey. For example, not all pesticides used in the
agricultural market compete with each other. Pesticides used as herbicides on corn do not compete with pesticides
used as fungicides on apples. Pesticide markets were therefore defined as clusters of PAIs that are substitutes in
a specific end-use (e.g., herbicides on corn). The list of 272 PAIs were mapped into 57 separate clusters along with
other non-272 PAIs with which they compete and are presented in Appendix F of the EIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PAI 56 is a member of cluster R&hyph;4 which is defined as: ``Sanitizers for use in dairies, food processing, restaurants,
and air treatment''. PAIs from the original list of 272 that are included in this cluster are: Hyamine 2389 (PAI 162),
methyl benzethonium chloride (PAI 159), Hyamine 1622 (PAI 105), Hyamine 3500 (PAI 56), oxine-sulfate (PAI 51), and
Hydroxyethyl amino ethanol (HAE) (PAI 36).

If the Agency were to adopt a different regulatory approach for different individual pesticides within a cluster
of pesticides, a market advantage might result for the less stringently regulated pesticides. To avoid this, EPA
created a subgroup based on the market and technical characteristics of facilities at which the majority of PAI use
comes from Cluster R&hyph;4. Analysis of facilities with the majority of PAI use from cluster R&hyph;4 (referred
to as ``sanitizer'' facilities) revealed the following differences in market and technical characteristics between
sanitizer and other PFPR facilities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sanitizer facilities obtained a smaller percentage of their revenue from PFPR than other facilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sanitizer facilities had lower facility revenues than other facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA also notes that sanitizer products, in contrast to other pesticide products, are intended to be discharged to
sinks and drains with normal use and therefore large quantities of the products themselves (apart from the PFPR wastestreams)
end up at the POTW. EPA is not aware that these products are causing any interferences at POTWs. In addition, adding
this small additional amount of sanitizer chemicals_19 lbs.-eq./year_to POTWs would not materially increase the
total amount of these chemicals being discharged to POTWs.

In recognition of the distinct market and technical characteristics exhibited by facilities with PFPR operations
concentrated on PAIs classified as sanitizers, the Agency proposes to treat them as a distinct segment or subgroup.
The subgroup does not apply broadly to facilities but, instead, applies to wastewater streams generated in conjunction
with the formulating, packaging, or repackaging of the six sanitizer chemicals that are physically separate from
wastewater streams from formulating, packaging, or repackaging of other PAIs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the considerations outlined in the foregoing discussion, EPA defined and analyzed an additional regulatory
option for sanitizer chemicals. This option (called Option 3/S) is the same as Option 3 discussed above except for
those facilities that formulate, package, or repackage sanitizer active ingredients and whose sanitizer production
is less than 265,000 pounds per year. Specifically, in such facilities, non-interior wastestreams such as those
from exterior cleaning, cleaning safety equipment, lab wastewater, floor washing and DOT test baths and that contain
only sanitizer active ingredients would be exempted from PSES. All other PAI wastestreams at these facilities, including
interior wastestreams containing sanitizers PAIs and any non-interior wastestreams containing both sanitizer
and other PAIs, would be subject to the zero discharge requirement. In the same way as for Option 3, the zero discharge
requirement for these other wastestreams can be met through pollution prevention practices. The Option 3 zero discharge
requirement would apply to all PAI wastestreams at any facilities whose wastestreams do not qualify for the sanitizer
PAI exemption. The projected impacts under Option 3/S are discussed below for all Subcategory C facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In defining this regulatory alternative, EPA set the 265,000 pounds per year production limit based on analysis of
the production volume of facilities that would be expected to avoid adverse impacts as a result of the Option 3/S sanitizer
chemical exemption. Specifically, in its facility impact analyses, EPA found that no facility larger than the 265,000
pounds per year production limit would avoid a significant impact as a result of the exemption. Accordingly, in an
effort to mitigate significant impacts among PFPR facilities owned by small businesses while retaining as large
a share as possible of the pollution reduction benefits of the originally selected Option 3, EPA decided to limit the
Option 3/S (ans the Option 3/S.1) sanitizer chemical exemption to only those facilities with less than 265,000 pounds
per year of production involving designated sanitizer PAIs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 7 compares the impacts projected under Option 3 and 3/S, providing detail for facilities with wastewater streams
containing only sanitizer PAIs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Impacts of Option 3/S. Under Option 3/S, 529 population facilities are estimated to incur costs. The incremental
capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring
costs) of complying with Option 3/S are estimated to be $63.0 million and $26.1 million, respectively. Compared to
Option 3, total annualized costs are reduced by approximately $2 million as a result of the reduced requirements on
exempted sanitizer PAI-only wastestreams. The possibility of facility closure was analyzed for 113 of these facilities
and the remaining 416 were analyzed for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility
revenue was conducted for all facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One facility is estimated to close due to compliance with Option 3/S. In addition, 136 facilities (20 percent fewer
than under Option 3) are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Under Option 3/S, total U.S. job losses are
estimated, in the worst case, to be 355 FTEs or 17 percent fewer than the 426 job losses estimated for Option 3. All of
the reduction in impacts necessarily occurs in facilities with non-interior wastewater streams containing only
sanitizer PAIs and whose sanitizer production volume is less than 265,000 pounds per year. The requirements of Option
3 and Option 3/S are the same for facilities that co-mingle their wastestreams or whose sanitizer production volume
is at least 265,000 pounds per year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency decided to propose Option 3/S.1 based on Option 3/S because: The impacts of Option 3 are largely on small
facilities, and are primarily due to the costs of having to install treatment for their non-interior wastestreams;
the amount of pollutants associated with their non-interior wastestreams is insignificant; and excluding their
non-interior wastestreams from coverage results in basically the same overall reduction in pollutants discharged
by the PFPR industry but significantly eases the burden on these small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adoption of Option 3/S.1 based on Option 3/S is consistent with the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
which directs agencies to examine any significant regulatory alternatives which will accomplish the stated objectives
of the applicable statute and which minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities.
(RFA Section 603). Section 603 also specifically mentions exemptions from coverage of the rule as one type of alternative
that could be examined.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Refilling establishments generate wastewater as a result of contaminated stormwater and leaks and spills falling
within their secondary containment areas or loading pads, as well as the collection and holding of rinsates from refillable
containers. Secondary containment and loading pad requirements for refilling establishments who handle agricultural
pesticides were recently proposed by EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. EPA considered two regulatory options
for refilling establishments. These two options would both require zero discharge of pollutants but they would be
based on different control technologies. Option 1 is based on reuse of all contaminated wastewater, and assumes that
the contaminated wastewater is used as make-up water in application of pesticide chemicals to the field. Option 2
assumes that the wastewater is disposed of by off-site incineration. The Agency is proposing Option 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. BPT. Refilling establishments with their use of refillable containers is a relatively new industry which developed
during the mid 1980s as a response to industry and environmental concerns regarding the packaging of pesticide products.
Because they are a new subcategory, they are not covered under the BPT zero discharge rule promulgated in 1978. EPA
is therefore establishing a new requirement for this subcategory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses to the survey indicate that there are no direct dischargers and therefore there are no costs to the industry
to comply with a BPT regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. PSES. Of the estimated 1,122 Subcategory E facilities that are potentially subject to the regulation, EPA's data
indicate that 98 percent, or 1,103 facilities, are already in compliance. Therefore, they would not incur any costs
to comply with the proposed regulatory option. In addition, the remaining 19 facilities are expected to be able to
achieve compliance with the proposed regulation at zero additional cost.

Under Option 2, the same population of facilities (i.e, approximately 19 facilities) were evaluated for compliance
costs. The estimated incremental capital and annualized total costs for these facilities (which include amortized
capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 2 is estimated to be $11,794
and $1,837, respectively. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for the 19
facilities with costs under Option 2. The estimated mean compliance cost as a percentage of facility revenue would
be 0.026 percent and the estimated median value 0.032 percent, with a range from 0.001 percent to 0.048 percent. No
facilities had a cost-to-revenue ratio greater than five percent. (See Table 8.)

D. Community Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As mentioned above, community impacts may result from facility-level impacts. Community impacts are typically
evaluated based on projected decreases in employment in communities affected by the regulation. For this analysis,
community impacts were assessed on the basis of both primary and secondary employment losses. Primary impacts consist
of the employment losses that are expected to occur as a direct result of the regulation. Secondary economic impacts
and associated employment losses occur in other businesses than those directly affected by regulation and result
from two mechanisms. First, reductions in output at directly affected facilities influence activity and employment
levels in linked industries (indirect effects). Second, the losses in employment and employee earnings in both the
directly and indirectly affected facilities result in reduced personal consumption expenditures, which may further
affect employment levels in the community (induced effects). If the aggregate impacts, including both primary and
secondary employment effects, amount to an employment decline of greater than one percent in an affected community,
then community impacts are deemed significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary employment losses estimated under Options 1 through 5, including Option 3/S, are presented above. (See
Tables 4 and 7.) The worst-case national estimated job losses ranged from a high of 1,173 full-time equivalents (FTEs)
under Option 5 to a low of 355 FTEs under the proposed Option 3/S. These job losses are distributed over a large number
of facilities, with the average job loss per affected facility under any of the options being about three FTEs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the sample was not designed to characterize community or state characteristics, accurate estimates of the
distribution of estimated job losses by community or state cannot be made. Nonetheless, the locations of the surveyed
impacted facilities show that the impacts are expected to be widely distributed nationally. (See Table 9.)

Although a statistically valid analysis of population level employment impacts on a regional or community level
cannot be performed, analyses based on assumptions regarding the locational distribution of primary employment
impacts can demonstrate that compliance with the proposed regulation is unlikely to have a significant impact on
community employment. To assess whether Option 3/S could be expected to result in significant community employment
impacts, EPA analyzed aggregate employment effects at the community level under highly conservative and unlikely
assumptions. Specifically, this analysis incorporated three assumptions that will likely lead to a substantial
overestimation of community-level impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA assumed that both closure and line conversion impacts would result in full loss of PFPR-related employment
at affected facilities. Line conversions would not generally be expected to result in employment losses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, to estimate secondary employment impacts, EPA used a worst-case regional impact multiplier from the Regional
Input-Output Modeling System developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the Department of Commerce.
BEA publishes state-level employment multipliers by industry classifications. For this analysis, EPA used the
highest state-level employment multiplier applicable to the Chemical and Petroleum Refining Industry, the 2-digit
BEA industry that is most likely to include facilities engaged in PFPR business. The highest total employment impact
multiplier reported by BEA is for the state of Texas and has a value of 9.20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, EPA assumed that all of the direct impact employment losses that are not directly accounted for by the affected
sample observations would occur at the known locations of the affected sample facilities in proportion to sample
facility weights. Thus, all of the facilities that are represented by an affected sample facility, and their associated
employment losses, are assumed to occur at the same location as the affected sample facility. This assumption regarding
the locational distribution of facility impacts is also expected to overstate employment losses in each metropolitan
statistical area (MSA), because the non-sample facility impacts would likely be distributed among other MSAs that
are unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using these highly unrealistic conservative assumptions, EPA found that Option 3/S is unlikely to result in significant
employment impacts at the community level. Specifically, the largest weighted aggregate employment impact under
this analysis is associated with an MSA in the state of Minnesota. The estimated sample facility-based employment
loss in the MSA is 37.2 FTEs. The sample weight associated with this facility is 4.9, meaning that, in the impact analysis,
the facility represents itself plus 3.9 other facilities in the underlying PFPR facility population whose locations
may not be estimated. Applying the sample weight brings the primary employment impact to 181.0. Further, applying
the industry impact multiplier for Texas of 9.20 brings the weighted aggregate employment impact to 1,665.2 full-time
equivalent employment positions. This unrealistically high value exceeds all the other simulated MSA-level impacts
by nearly a factor of three. Although this value also yields the highest percentage loss in MSA employment, at 0.1181
percent, it is still less than one-eighth of the one percent significant impact threshold (see Table 10). The next
highest percentage employment impacts are 0.0738 percent, in Missouri, and 0.0656 percent, in Texas, or approximately
1/14th and 1/15th of the one percent impact threshold, respectively. Even using highly unrealistic assumptions,
this analysis finds that Option 3/S would not likely cause a significant loss of employment in any affected MSA.

The community-level employment impact values presented in this table provide a worst-case illustration of possible
impacts in the MSAs in which those sample facilities assessed as incurring economic impacts were located. The employment
losses are likely to overstate substantially actual impacts because of the use of a maximum employment impact multiplier
and because non-sample facility impacts (for which an impact location is unknown) are assumed to occur in the same
MSA as the sample facility is located. In fact, the non-sample facility employment impacts are likely to be distributed
among these and other unknown MSAs in a way that does not yield as high a concentration of impacts at the sample facility
locations as indicated in this analysis.

E. Foreign Trade Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Products of the PFPR industry are traded internationally. Therefore, changes in domestic production resulting
from effluent regulations may affect the balance of trade. EPA evaluated the potential foreign trade impacts of the
PFPR regulation by separately estimating the changes in both exports and imports that could occur as a result of a PSES
regulation for Subcategory C (PFPR) Facilities. EPA analyzed foreign trade impacts under two cases: a proportional
case, which assesses trade impacts based on the relative competitiveness of U.S. and foreign producers in international
markets; and a worst case, which makes severely conservative assumptions regarding U.S. competitiveness. Both
analyses showed relatively minor trade impacts from the regulatory option, Option 3/S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade impacts were examined for the six PSES options considered for Subcategory C Facilities. Among these options,
the estimated impacts of proposed Option 3/S are the least severe under both the worst-case and proportional case
assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Proportional Case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The analysis of trade impacts focuses on the PFPR sales of facilities that are assessed as closures or line conversions
as the result of the PFPR rule. When a facility ceases PFPR production, the markets that it served, both domestic and
export, are assumed to be competed for by other domestic producers and foreign producers. Under the proportional
case assumptions, domestic and foreign producers share in these markets on a proportional basis according to their
average participation in domestic and export markets before regulation. These assumptions allow foreign producers
to compete away a share of both the sales to domestic production and sales for export that had previously been supplied
by the impacted facilities. The shares of these markets that are won by foreign producers reflect the long-run success
of foreign and domestic producers in competing for domestic and export markets. In effect, the proportional case
assumes that foreign and domestic producers would remain as competitive on the margin in capturing domestic and export
PFPR markets as they are currently on average. Specifically, exports decline as domestic producers are assumed to
capture 30.2 percent of impacted facilities' former exports while foreign producers capture 69.8 percent of this
amount. And imports increase as domestic producers are assumed to retain 82.1 percent of impacted facilities' former
sales for domestic consumption, while foreign producers capture 17.9 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated decrease in exports (stated as a positive value) and increase in imports are summed to yield the estimated
decline in the U.S. PFPR trade balance. Under the proportional case assumptions, the estimated trade impact under
Option 3 amounts to a $9,872,000 decrease in the pesticide trade balance, or a 1.04 percent decline. Option 3/S would
result in a $9,190,000 decrease in the pesticide trade balance, or a decline of less than one percent (see Table 11 below).

2. Worst-Case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The worst-case analysis again begins with foreign and domestic producers competing to capture the domestic and export
PFPR sales of facilities that were assessed as closures or line conversions as the result of the PFPR regulation. Under
the worst-case assumptions, however, foreign producers are assumed to win this competition completely. That is,
the sales for domestic consumption are fully replaced by increased imports and the sales for export are fully replaced
by foreign producers. These assumptions maximize the possible adverse trade impact associated with reduced production
and sales of PFPR products by significantly impacted facilities. The estimated decline in exports (stated as a positive
number) and increase in imports are summed to yield the decline in the balance of trade in the PFPR market. This analysis
makes severe and unrealistic assumptions, but serves to illustrate the minimal impact that the regulation is expected
to have on foreign trade, even under the most conservative assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the worst-case assumptions a decrease of $43,995,000 in the net trade balance (4.6 percent) is projected under
Option 3, and a decrease of $40,184,000 (4.2 percent) is calculated for the proposed option, Option 3/S (see Table
11).

F. Impacts on Firms Owning PFPR Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment of economic achievability of the PFPR regulation is based primarily on the facility-level impact
analysis. However, because the impacts at the level of the firm may exceed those assessed at the level of the facility,
particularly when a firm owns more than one facility that will be subject to regulation, EPA also conducted a firm-level
impact analysis for the PFPR regulation. The firm-level analysis estimates the impact of regulatory compliance
on firms owning facilities subject to PFPR effluent guidelines. A firm-level analysis was conducted for all firms
which own at least one sample facility that uses water in its PFPR operations, and therefore for which financial data
were available. Because of sample design considerations, the findings from the firm-level analysis, which is based
on facilities in the sample survey, cannot be extrapolated on a statistically valid basis to the population level
of PFPR industry firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firm-level impact analysis involves aggregating financial and compliance cost data for sample facilities by
firm. Compliance cost data for the sample facilities within a firm were then used to impute compliance costs for the
portion of a firm's PFPR revenue that was not covered by the data for sample facilities. Baseline cost adjustments
from other regulatory requirements were also included in the firm-level analysis and were apportioned to those revenues
within the firm that were not reflected by sample facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firm-level financial impact was assessed on the basis of change in pre-tax return on assets (ROA) taking into account
the expected compliance requirements for sample facilities and the portion of a firm's PFPR revenue that was not covered
by the data for sample facilities. ROA was calculated for the baseline and post-compliance, and compared with a threshold
value based on the lowest quartile data for SIC codes in the 2800 group (Chemicals and Allied Products) of 2.396 percent.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 ROA is a measure of the profitability of a firm's capital assets, independent of the effects of taxes and financial
structure. This financial measure provides information regarding the competitive position of the firm within the
industry, as well as operating margin and asset management capability. If a firm cannot sustain a competitive ROA
when baseline costs and compliance costs are considered, then the firm will likely have difficulty financing the
costs of complying with the regulation.

1. Baseline Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The baseline ROA analysis evaluates the firm's financial operating condition before costs of complying with the
proposed regulatory option are considered. This analysis identifies firms which are expected to be financially
weak relative to the overall industry before the regulation is enacted. For the firm-level analysis, baseline costs
for non-sample PFPR facilities were estimated and summed with the sample facility firms' costs. Baseline costs include
the estimated costs associated with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Organic Chemicals, Plastics,
and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) (40 CFR 414), Pesticide Manufacturing, and FIFRA regulations as previously described.
The non-sample baseline costs were estimated based upon the portion of PFPR firm revenue which is not attributable
to the sample facilities, and on the ratio of firm baseline costs to firm revenues from PFPR. Baseline costs for manufacturing
facilities that do not perform PFPR activities owned by the firms being analyzed were also included in the analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Firms that have a baseline ROA of less than the threshold value are not considered for compliance impacts because their
financial weakness results from current circumstances. Of the 308 firms initially considered in the analysis, 66
firms (all of which are single entities) had a baseline ROA of less than the threshold level of 2.396 and were therefore
not considered in the remainder of the analysis. Thus, 242 firms were considered for impacts from the proposed PFPR
regulation.

Of the 242 firms considered for compliance impacts, 5 firms were found to have a post-compliance ROA of less than 2.396
percent and are therefore assessed as incurring adverse financial impacts as a result of regulatory compliance.
Three of these five firms are private single entities and two are private multi-facility firms. No firm impacts are
expected to occur among public-reporting firms. The Agency judges that these firm-level impacts should not pose
a significant burden to the PFPR industry (see Table 12).

1. Subcategory C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As stated above, EPA is proposing to establish NSPS as zero discharge, equivalent to the BAT requirements for existing
sources. Zero discharge represents best available and best available demonstrated technology for the pesticide
formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategory as a whole. The economic impact analysis for existing sources
shows that this regulatory approach (termed Option 3 in the discussion above) would be economically achievable for
the industry. EPA believes that new sources will be able to comply at costs that are similar to or less than the costs
for existing sources, because new sources can apply control technologies (including dedicated lines and pressurized
hoses for equipment cleaning) more efficiently than sources that need to retrofit for those technologies. EPA's
analysis concludes that a zero discharge requirement for new source direct dischargers would be economically achievable
and would not be a barrier to entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to set pretreatment standards for new sources (which cover indirect dischargers) equivalent to
the NSPS standards (which cover direct dischargers), i.e., at zero discharge for all PFPR waste streams. For the reasons
stated above with respect to the NSPS standards, EPA finds that the PSNS regulations would be economically achievable
and not a barrier to entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA has proposed to exempt the non-interior waste streams of the small sanitizers from this zero discharge
requirement for existing pretreatment facilities (PSES), EPA is not proposing to include this same exemption for
the new source pretreatment facilities (PSNS). The rationale for finding that the exemption for those sanitizer
waste streams is appropriate for existing sources is based on EPA's findings that the impacts on existing small entities
would be significantly reduced by the exemption while the associated additional loading of toxic pollutants would
be small. With respect to new source pretreaters, EPA does not have sufficient information to conclude that the size
and economic conditions of those new sources, the impacts on those new sources, and the associated loadings of toxic
pollutants, would justify a similar exemption for the non-interior waste streams for sanitizer facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA has proposed to set a zero discharge requirement for NSPS, also without any exemption for sanitizers'
waste streams, based on the proposal to set BAT at zero discharge for all waste streams and the finding that NSPS should
be set at a level at least as stringent as BAT.

2. Subcategory E 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA is proposing NSPS/PSNS for Subcategory E facilities equal to BAT/PSES proposed limitations for existing sources.
Compliance with BAT/PSES is projected to have zero costs for existing facilities. Likewise, new facilities are not
expected to incur additional annual costs due to the regulation. Since compliance with the proposed option has been
found to be economically achievable for existing facilities, EPA has determined that compliance with NSPS/PSNS
will also be economically achievable and not a barrier to entry for new sources.

H. Benefits of Pollution Prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Typically, the economic achievability of a regulation is evaluated by considering the impacts of projected compliance
costs on an industry, for example, the costs of installing and operating a treatment technology. However, facilities
may offset some of their compliance costs by achieving regulatory compliance through use of pollution prevention
measures. The cost analysis of the proposed PFPR regulation assumes that, where possible, facilities will use certain
pollution prevention measures to achieve zero discharge. These measures include, for example, recovery and reuse
of rinse waters and other wastewaters that contain reusable PAIs. By recovering and reusing the PAIs contained in
such wastewaters, facilities may save on the purchase cost of PAIs, water consumption costs, and sewage treatment
costs. The cost analyses described above for the proposed regulation reflect the costs of implementing such pollution
prevention measures and reflect cost savings from reduced waste management and disposal costs (about $4.7 million
on an annualized basis). The regulatory cost analyses, however, do not include certain additional offsetting cost
savings that may accrue to facilities through pollution prevention.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To provide a more comprehensive accounting of the costs of achieving compliance with the proposed PFPR regulation,
EPA therefore identified and assessed additional mechanisms by which facilities might achieve cost savings through
use of pollution prevention. Specifically, EPA identified five mechanisms by which facilities may offset some of
their regulatory compliance costs through pollution prevention. Two mechanisms are associated with the direct
costs of PFPR processing and manufacturing PAIs: recovery of PAIs, and recovery of water (reducing water and discharge
costs). The other three mechanisms, termed indirect cost savings, arise from reductions in facility and firm costs
(or other business-enhancing benefits) that are not directly associated with the manufacturing or PFPR processing
of PAIs. These indirect cost savings mechanisms include: reductions in permitting costs, reductions in business
insurance premiums, and reductions in firm cost of capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using Survey data for PFPR facilities subject to regulation, EPA estimated facility-specific savings for the two
direct cost mechanisms listed above. Although EPA was not able to estimate facility-specific savings for the three
indirect cost mechanisms, EPA assessed these opportunities on the basis of discussions with permitting authority
and insurance and finance industry personnel and a review of relevant literature. From these discussions and reviews,
EPA concluded that the indirect cost mechanisms would also offer cost-savings opportunities to PFPR industry firms
that adopt pollution prevention measures as part of their compliance strategy.

1. Savings From Reduced Water Use and Water Discharge
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Wastewaters that contain reusable PAIs can be recovered and reused with the same line or processes in a PFPR facility
from which it was taken. Economic benefits can accrue due to the reduced demand for new water and as well from decreased
volume of wastewater discharge and associated sewage system costs. In its analysis, EPA assumed 100 percent reduction
or reuse of water that is currently discharged. Water and sewer rates were obtained from Ernst &amp; Young's Water
and Wastewater 1992 Survey of the monthly rates for the 100 largest metropolitan areas. EPA supplemented this rate
information with data on water rates for facility locations not covered by the Ernst &amp; Young data. Also, EPA adjusted
these rates to reflect the trend in expected increases in water and sewer rates which is greater than the general rate
of inflation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 529 facilities with compliance costs under Option 3/S, EPA estimated that 519 facilities could be expected
to achieve water and sewer cost savings by use of pollution prevention. For those facilities achieving cost savings,
the mean water and sewer savings is estimated at $213 per annum. The maximum annual savings at an individual facility
is approximately $11,000. On average, these savings represent about one percent of the total annualized compliance
costs for the facilities expected to achieve water and sewer cost savings. However, the maximum percentage of compliance
costs estimated to be saved at a specific facility is about 11 percent of total annual compliance costs. For some facilities,
therefore, the reuse and recovery of water and PAIs can provide substantial savings. On the basis of the individual
facility values, EPA estimates national aggregate annual benefits from water and sewer savings of $116,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under Option 3/S, facilities will recover PAIs from interior wastewater streams. The value of these PAIs was estimated
based on PAI-specific prices calculated for the pesticide manufacturers effluent guideline when necessary data
were available, and from secondary sources when not. Of the 545 facilities expected to incur compliance costs under
Option 3/S, 354 were assessed as being able to recover and reuse PAIs by use of pollution prevention in complying with
the proposed PFPR regulation. In aggregate, facilities are estimated to save about 77,816 pounds of active ingredient
per year with a total value of $628,065 (in 1988 dollars). The mean estimated annual PAI savings per facility with savings
was estimated at $1,777. On average, these savings represent about 0.65 percent of these facilities' total annual
compliance cost. The facility with the highest savings is estimated to save $427,000 per year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA believes that facilities may also save money by reducing indirect and direct discharge permitting costs as a result
of using pollution prevention measures in complying with Option 3/S. Permitting costs include application fees,
costs of preparing applications, discharge monitoring reports and engineering reports, annual fees, and monitoring
costs. A review of permitting information from several states with PFPR facilities showed that permitting costs
vary considerably from state to state. In general, reducing or eliminating discharge volumes through pollution
prevention should allow facilities to save on permitting costs. In some cases, facilities may be able to forego permitting
costs entirely by eliminating discharges. In other cases, facilities may incur lower permitting costs. For example,
several states vary permit application and maintenance fees based on facility discharge volumes and complexity
of discharge streams. Some states indicated that their permit fee structures have been explicitly designed, or are
being designed, to promote pollution prevention as a discharge reduction or elimination method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permitting cost amounts that may be saved vary from a few hundred dollars a year for some POTW-related charges to
tens of thousands of dollars for direct discharge permits. As an illustration of the possible significance of these
savings, EPA developed an example scenario in which total PFPR industry annual permitting cost savings might amount
to $2 million or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comments from the industry and other parties on the likelihood and possible value of such savings.

4. Savings From Reduced Insurance Premiums

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Although liability and general business insurance policies do not currently incorporate discounts for use of pollution
prevention, trends in insurance coverage show that decreasing risks in the chemical industry will be reflected in
cost savings in the insurance premiums. Specifically, the insurance industry has begun to recognize that pollution
prevention efforts can reduce a number of business and liability risks. Representatives from business insurance
firms indicate that compliance with the PFPR effluent limitations guideline by means of pollution prevention could
result in lower insurance premiums through several mechanisms, for example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reduced volume of pesticide ingredients shipped and handled at a facility can result in lower risk of hazardous
exposures for workers and the surrounding community; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Elimination of pollutant discharges would result in a lower risk of leaks or accidental excess discharges
of polluting materials; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Elimination of pollutant discharges reduces the risk that a facility would be found in violation of discharge
limits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As pollution prevention methods become more accepted and their efficient and effective performance is better established,
insurance firms will be more likely to account for the potential risk-reducing benefits of pollution prevention
programs in setting insurance premiums. EPA requests that industry discuss the likelihood and possible extent of
such savings in its comments on the proposed regulation.

5. Savings From Reduced Cost of Capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Compliance by pollution prevention under Option 3/S can provide financial benefits to firms by reducing the cost
of capital. Decreases in the amount of pesticides being used can reduce contingent liabilities associated with worker
safety and environmental compliance issues, and may also provide preferential recognition and valuation in the
public capital markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The factors that influence the cost of capital to a firm include: the firm's expected financial performance; the variability
of the firm's financial performance; the financial structure of the firm and the associated variability in the performance
of the instruments by which the firm's assets are financed; and the relationship of the variability in the firm's own
financial performance to that of other firms and competing investment opportunities. These factors determine the
overall riskiness of a firm as an investment or lending opportunity. In general, actions that reduce the riskiness
or expected variability of a firm's financial performance will reduce its cost of capital. Adoption of pollution
prevention measures can reduce the riskiness of the firm's financial performance through:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Avoidance of contingent liabilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For similar reasons to those outlined above for reduced insurance costs, use of pollution prevention measures by
PFPR facilities can reduce contingent liabilities that pose a risk for creditors and investors. For example, more
efficient use of PAIs and the use of dedicated lines for each PAI or product can reduce the overall level of worker exposure
to PAIs due to elimination or reduction of cleanup due to product changeover. In addition, the reduction or reuse of
PAIs can reduce or eliminate pollutant discharges, thereby reducing risks to the surrounding community from accidental
spills or leakage and also reducing the risk of being found in violation of discharge limits. Each of these contingencies
may pose a financial risk to the firm. Elimination or reduction of such contingent liabilities should reduce uncertainty
about future financial performance and result in lower required returns for creditors and investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased managerial control of the firm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Facilities that prevent pollution associated with PAI use will be better able to control the financial impact of
environmental regulations. Firms that limit but continue to discharge effluents are left with the risk of achieving
compliance with possibly more stringent environmental requirements in the future. Firms that implement pollution
prevention (i.e., source reduction and recycling of wastewaters) to eliminate discharges are proactively avoiding,
and therefore controlling, the possibility of these future compliance costs. The removal of this cost uncertainty
should make those firms that adopt pollution prevention less risky to invest in or lend to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preferential recognition and valuation by investors and lenders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some investors preferentially search for firms that apply effective and proactive pollution prevention programs.
For example, some mutual funds include a social/environmental responsibility component in their charter. Firms
that are perceived as environmentally responsible may be awarded a higher valuation and lower cost of capital in the
public capital markets.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Improved firm financial performance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Finally, some consumers may favor products of firms that are perceived as environmentally responsible (as defined
by the individual consumer). To the extent that a mechanism exists for consumers to be aware that a given firm has undertaken
pollution prevention programs, consumers may favor that firm's products over those of its competitors and thus improve
the firm's business prospects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comments on the likelihood and possible extent of such financial benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, although EPA has been able to quantify only partially the potential cost-savings benefits of pollution
prevention, EPA believes that these benefits may significantly improve the financial circumstances of many facilities
and firms that choose pollution prevention as a means of complying with the proposed PFPR effluent limitation guideline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Firms will need to install and operate compliance systems to comply with an effluent limitations guideline for the
PFPR industry. The manufacture, installation, and operation of these systems will require use of labor resources.
To the extent that these labor needs translate into employment increases in affected firms, a PFPR rule has the potential
to generate employment benefits. If realized, these employment benefits may partially offset the employment losses
that are expected to occur in facilities impacted by the rule. The employment effects that would occur in the manufacture,
installation, and operation of treatment systems are termed the ``direct'' employment benefits of the rule. Because
these employment effects are directly attributable to the PFPR rule, they are conceptually parallel to the employment
losses that were estimated for the facilities that are expected to incur significant impacts as a result of the PFPR
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to direct employment benefits, the PFPR rule may generate other employment benefits through two mechanisms.
First, employment effects may occur in the industries that are linked to the industries that manufacture and install
compliance equipment; these effects are termed ``indirect'' employment benefits. For example, a firm that manufactures
the pumps, piping and other hardware that comprise a treatment system will purchase intermediate goods and services
from other firms and sectors of the economy. Thus, increased economic activity in the firm that manufacturers the
treatment system components has the potential to increase activity and employment in these linked firms and sectors.
Second, the increased payments to labor in the directly and indirectly affected industries will lead to increased
purchases from consumer-oriented service and retail businesses, which in turn lead to additional labor demand and
employment benefits in those businesses. These effects are termed ``induced'' employment benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of these possible employment benefits, EPA estimated the labor requirements associated with compliance
with the PFPR effluent guidelines Option 3/S. Labor requirements_and thus the possible employment benefits_were
estimated in two steps. EPA first estimated the direct employment effects associated with the manufacture, installation,
and operation of the PFPR compliance equipment. Second, EPA considered the additional employment effects that might
occur through the indirect and induced effect mechanisms outlined above.

1. Direct Labor Requirements of Complying With the PFPR Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA separately analyzed each component of the direct labor requirements: Manufacturing, installing, and operating
compliance equipment. The analysis is based on the compliance cost estimates developed for the economic impact analysis
of the PFPR regulation. Compliance requirements and associated costs were estimated for each facility in the Survey
that was assessed as incurring costs. For the labor requirements analysis, compliance costs and their associated
labor requirements were considered only for those facilities that were not assessed as a baseline closure, or as a
closure or line conversion due to compliance. That is, the analysis considered the labor requirement effects associated
only with those facilities that, upon compliance with the rule, would be likely to continue PFPR production activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimated the direct labor requirements for manufacturing and installing compliance equipment based on the
cost of the equipment and its installation, and labor's expected share of cost in manufacturing and installing the
equipment. The labor input was estimated in dollars based on information contained in the National Input-Output
Tables assembled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce. In particular, the direct requirements
matrix identifies the value of each input, including labor, that is required to produce a one dollar value of output
for a subject industry. The industries in the input-output tables that were used as the basis for this analysis are:
the Heating, Plumbing, and Fabricated Structural Metal Products Industry (Bureau of Economic Analysis industry
classification 40) for compliance equipment manufacturing; and the Repair and Maintenance Construction Industry
(Bureau of Economic Analysis industry classification 12) for compliance equipment installation. The dollar value
of labor's contribution was converted to a full-time employment equivalent based on a yearly labor cost of $35,800
(1988 dollars, including benefits and payroll taxes). Because compliance equipment purchase and installation
are considered one-time outlays, the labor requirements for these activities were annualized over a 10-year period
at the seven percent social discount rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the analysis of the labor required to operate compliance equipment, EPA used the estimates of annual labor hours
that had been developed as the basis for assessing the annual operating and maintenance costs of the PFPR regulatory
options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From these analyses, EPA estimated an annual direct labor requirement of 131 full-time equivalent positions for
complying with the Option 3/S PFPR regulation. Of this total, the annualized labor requirements for manufacturing
and installing compliance equipment are 71 and 27 full-time equivalent positions, respectively. Compliance equipment
operation is estimated to require 32 full-time equivalent positions annually. The corresponding annual estimated
payments to labor is $4,676,685 (1988 dollars) (see Table 13).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to its direct labor effects, the PFPR effluent guideline may also generate labor requirements through
the indirect and induced effect mechanisms described above. EPA assessed the indirect and induced employment effects
by use of multipliers that relate aggregate economic effects, including indirect and induced effects, to direct
economic effects. Using a range of multipliers from previous studies of the aggregate employment effects of general
water treatment and pollution control expenditures, EPA estimated that the total labor requirement effect of the
Option 3/S rule would range from 353 to 523 full-time equivalent positions. The lower end of this range reflects the
use of lower multiplier values and conservative assumptions regarding effects on economic activity in industries
linked to the PFPR industry. The higher end of the range reflects the higher multiplier values and assumes full incurrence
of indirect economic effects in industries linked to the PFPR industry.

J. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of PSES Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the foregoing analyses, the Agency has performed a cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness
analysis compares the total annualized cost incurred for a regulatory option to the corresponding effectiveness
of that option in reducing the discharge of pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost-effectiveness calculations are used in setting effluent limitations guidelines to compare the efficiency
of one regulatory option is removing pollutants to another regulatory option. Cost-effectiveness is defined as
the incremental annual cost of a pollution control option in an industry subcategory per incremental pollutant removal.
The increments are considered relative to another option or to a benchmark, such as existing treatment. Pollutant
removals are measured in copper based ``pounds-equivalent.'' The cost-effectiveness value, therefore, represents
the unit cost of removing the next pound-equivalent (lb eq.) of pollutant. While not required by the Clean Water Act,
cost-effectiveness analysis is a useful tool for evaluating regulatory options for the removal of toxic pollutants.
Cost-effectiveness analysis is not intended to analyze the removal of conventional pollutants (oil and grease,
biological oxygen demand, and total suspended solids). The removal of conventional pollutants is therefore not
addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of the regulatory options, the estimated pounds-equivalent removed were calculated by weighting the number
of pounds of each pollutant removed by the relative toxic weighting factor for each pollutant. The use of pounds-equivalent
gives correspondingly more weight to more highly toxic pollutants. Thus, for a given expenditure and pounds of pollutants
removed, the cost per pound-equivalent removed would be lower when more highly toxic pollutants are removed than
if pollutants of lesser toxicity are removed. Cost-effectiveness is calculated as the ratio of the incremental annual
costs to the incremental pounds-equivalent removed for each option. So that comparisons of the cost-effectiveness
among other regulated industries may be made, annual costs for all cost-effectiveness analyses are reported in 1981
dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 14 provides estimates of the total annualized compliance costs, in 1981 dollars, and the total pollutant removals
in pounds and pounds-equivalent. Table 15 lists estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness of the regulatory
options.

Options are ranked by increasing levels of pollutant removals. Negative cost-effectiveness numbers mean that costs
have decreased from the previous option, while removals have increased, improving cost-effectiveness. This increase
in removals at a lower cost makes Option 1 and Option 2 inefficient in comparison to Option 3/S.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As can be seen from the above tables, the cost-effectiveness of Option 1 is $2.10 per pound-equivalent of pollutant
removed. Option 1 is relatively cost-effective when compared to the cost-effectiveness values of other effluent
limitations guidelines. Movement from Option 1 to Option 2 and from Option 2 to Option 3/S is cost-effective relative
to Option 1 because costs are reduced while removals increase. Movement from Option 3/S to Option 3 is less efficient
than movement from Option 1 to Option 2 or from Option 2 to Option 3/S. The average cost-effectiveness of Option 3 is
$1.79 per pound-equivalent and for Option 3/S is $1.68. Options 4 and 5 are not cost-effective as they result in additional
costs with no additional removals relative to Option 3. Option 3/S is the most cost-effective option. Successive
improvements in weighted removals are achieved at progressively lower costs by moving from Option 1 through Option
2 to Option 3/S. Further movement from Option 3/S to Options 3, 4 or 5 provides minor additional removals at substantially
higher marginal cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs and removals resulting from the two regulatory options considered for Subcategory E facilities are presented
in Table 16 below. Option 1, the proposed option is expected to be met with no additional compliance costs, therefore
its cost-effectiveness is zero. Option 2 requires additional costs but results in no additional removals, so its
cost-effectiveness value is undefined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) calls for the Agency to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) for regulations that
have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that, while
achieving statutory goals, government regulations do not impose disproportionate impacts on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implications of the Regulatory Flexibility Act are discussed below for facilities regulated under Subcategory
C. No economic impacts on small entities are projected for Subcategory E.

1. Subcategory C Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA defines a small entity based on the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) standards. The SBA has established
standards based on employment at firms (including all affiliates and divisions) for each SIC group. For SIC 2879 (``establishments
primarily engaged in the formulation and preparation of ready-to-use agricultural and household pest control chemicals'')
the SBA defines a small business as one employing less than 500 people. Employment data for firms that own sample PFPR
facilities were obtained largely from the Section 308 Survey and from Dun and Bradstreet's Million Dollar Directory.
Based on this information, 75 percent of the firms owning PFPR facilities which use water are classified as small.
Given this high percentage of small entities, the Agency is concerned with the potential burden of this rule on small
businesses. EPA therefore focused the consideration of alternative regulations on small entities that were the
most significantly burdened by the regulation and whose effluent was in low quantities and had low toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Severity of impacts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consistent with the other components of the EIA, significant impacts were defined as facility closures, product
line conversions, or a cost-to-revenue ratio of greater than five percent. EPA evaluated the impacts on small entities
under Option 3_the option that was initially considered for proposal. The option resulted in a significant number
of moderate impacts on facilities owned by small entities. EPA has determined that Option 3 is economically achievable.
The impacts, while considered significant, are not severe. Only one facility is expected to close. Most of the estimated
impacts are related to line conversions. Even if all the lines close instead of converting to other formulating/packaging
activities, job losses would not exceed 451 employees nationally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Differential impacts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA subsequently conducted a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Agency evaluated whether small business impacts
were concentrated in a particular market. As Table 17 shows, impacted facilities owned by small entities usually
obtain less than 25 percent of their revenue from pesticides and are most heavily concentrated in the institutional/commercial
market. Further, as shown previously in Table 5, the frequency of impacted facilities in this market is much heavier
than for the remainder of the PFPR industry. The Agency also evaluated the PAIs most frequently used by the impacted
facilities owned by small businesses. The PAI most frequently used by these facilities is PAI 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

c. Consideration of alternative options.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because there may be a disproportionate impact on some small entities, EPA identified and considered alternative
regulatory options that would still accomplish the objectives of the Clean Water Act (See Section 603 of the Reg. Flex
Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA then evaluated the pollution contribution associated with small impacted facilities relative to other groups
and determined that there were two distinct groups within those facilities impacted. The two groups are wastestreams
containing only R&hyph;4 products and all other wastestreams. Because of the differential pollution contribution
of these two groups, EPA decided to investigate alternative, less burdensome regulatory approaches for those facilities
which have separable wastestreams containing the R&hyph;4 products listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3/S is proposed as an alternative to Option 3 that results in decreased impacts on the most heavily burdened
subgroup of facilities owned by small businesses. Impacts upon facilities owned by small businesses fell from 161
under Option 3 to 126 under Option 3/S. The 3/S exemption results in a minimal increase (203 pounds and 19 toxic weighted
pounds) in releases to the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relief provided for R&hyph;4 producing facilities (with separable wastestreams) falls into the dual categories
of exemption based alternatives and relaxed standards for small entities. Option 3/S provides a partial exemption
from certain regulatory requirements (treat and reuse) for certain classes and other small entity standards (the
separable R&hyph;4 wastestreams and their producers).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA certifies that the proposed regulation for Subcategory E facilities would not impose a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, the Agency did not perform a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis for the Subcategory E regulation.

L. Assessment of Economic Impacts Including Additional PAIs not on the Original List of 272 PAIs Studied for Regulation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has also estimated the economic impacts of including under the proposed option all other PAIs not on the list of
272 PAIs studied in detail to develop these proposed regulations. The analysis was conducted on two separate sets
of facilities: (1) facilities that formulate, package or repackage using these additional PAIs as well as the original
272 PAIs, and (2) facilities that use only the additional PAIs.

Compliance cost estimates were developed for the first set of facilities under a regulatory option to include the
additional PAIs. This regulatory option, Option 3/S.1, is analogous to Option 3/S, except that Option 3/S.1 regulates
additional PAIs beyond the original 272 PAIs. The estimated costs and impacts of this regulatory option, Option 3/S.1,
are presented in the Table 18 below, in comparison with the costs and impacts of Option 3/S.

Under Option 3/S.1, EPA estimates that 544 Subcategory C facilities will incur costs. The capital and annualized
total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying
with Option 3/S.1 are estimated to be $102.9 and $40.1 million, respectively. One Subcategory C facility is estimated
to close due to compliance with Option 3/S.1. One hundred sixty-seven facilities are estimated to incur moderate
impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 470 FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts.

2. Facilities Using Only the Additional PAIs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To estimate the impact on the second set of facilities, those facilities that formulate, package or repackage only
non-272 active ingredients, EPA assumed that they were similar to the surveyed facilities in the following ways:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) They have the same proportion of water dischargers that will incur costs, (2) they have the same average cost per
facility, and (3) they will have the same percent of closures and moderate impacts. Using these assumptions, the Agency
projects that the non-272 PFPR facilities would incur $10.2 million in annual costs, one facility closure, and 83
moderate impacts. EPA also estimates that there could be as many as 13 additional manufacturing facilities that also
formulate, package or repackage pesticide products, not included in the study of the facilities that formulate,
package or repackage the 272 PAIs. EPA estimates that costs for this subgroup of 13 facilities would be $5.8 million
and would result in no additional impacts. This information is summarized in Table 19. Table 19 presents only the data
used to proportion costs for facilities that only make non-272 PAI products. Therefore, Table 19 does not include
the estimated costs for the expanded scope production at facilities which produce both 272 PAIs and non-272 PAIs.

1Percentage calculations are based on findings from detailed analyses of facilities using 272 PAIs. Each percentage
value indicates the share of the preceding population group (for facilities using 272 PAIs) that is estimated to fall
in that row's named population category. For example, of the 2,404 PFPR facilities using 272 PAIs, 1,794 or 74.6 percent
are estimated to use water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
2Within the 1,475 facilities estimated to use only the non-272 PAIs, the estimated number of facilities falling in
each population group (e.g., water-users or facilities incurring impacts) is based on applying the relevant percentage
from the analysis of PFPR facilities using the 272 PAIs. For example, of the 1,475 facilities using only non-272 PAIs,
74.6 percent or 1,101 facilities are estimated to use water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
3The estimates of average facility and total annual compliance cost for non-272 PAI facilities are based on the estimated
average facility costs for facilities using only the original 272 PAIs. That is, the average facility annual compliance
costs of $32,871 and $429,065, which were calculated from analysis of only the original 272 PAIs, are assumed to apply
also for the non-272 PAI facilities. The aggregate annual compliance cost values for facilities using only non-272
PAIs were then calculated by multiplying the average costs per facility by the estimated number of facilities in the
relevant non-272 PAI facility category (e.g., 311 PFPR-only facilities x $32,871/per facility = $10.2 million total
annual cost for PFPR-only facilities using only non-272 PAIs).

The aggregate costs and impacts of Option 3/S.1 are the combined impacts upon facilities using both the original 272
PAIs and additional PAIs and facilities using only the additional PAIs. These costs and impacts are reported in Table
20. There are 869 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 3/S.1. The annualized total
costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with
Option 3/S.1 are estimated to be $56.1 million. Two Subcategory C facilities are expected to close due to the compliance
requirement imposed by Option 3/S.1. Two hundred fifty facilities are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts.
Total job losses in impacted facilities are projected, in the worst case, to be 688 as a result of the proposed Option
3/S.1 regulation. Accordingly, the Agency finds that the overall impacts of this proposed rule on all pesticide formulator,
packager and repackager facilities are economically achievable.

As discussed above in Subsection 9, Labor Requirements and Possible Employment Benefits of Regulatory Compliance,
EPA also recognized that the manufacture, installation, and operation of equipment for complying with the Option
3/S.1 regulation would require use of labor resources. To the extent that these labor needs translate into employment
increases in complying firms, the regulation has the potential to generate employment benefits that may partially
offset the employment losses that are expected to occur in facilities impacted by the rule. Using the same methodology
as described in Subsection 9, EPA estimated an annual direct labor requirement of 211 full-time equivalent positions
for complying with the Option 3/S.1 regulation. This labor requirement may offset somewhat the conservatively estimated
688 employment losses in impacted PFPR facilities (see Table 21).

4. Cost-Effectiveness of Option 3/S.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Agency estimated the cost-effectiveness of Option 3/S.1. The cost-effectiveness was conservatively estimated
by considering the costs of removing the non-272 PAI wastewater pollutants and the 272 PAIs, but considering the number
of toxic pounds removed only for the 272 PAIs. The analysis therefore understates the cost-effectiveness of the proposed
option. To the extent that removals of non-272 PAI wastewater pollutants are achieved, the proposed option will be
far more cost-effective than presented here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated total annualized cost of Option 3/S.1 is $43.9 million in 1981 dollars. Option 3/S achieved an estimated
12,134,045 pounds-equivalent of pollutant removals. The average cost-effectiveness of Option 3/S.1 considering
only the 272 PAIs is $3.62 per pound equivalent. EPA estimates that the proposed option will remove an additional 198,519

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unweighted
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pounds of non-272 PAIs that are not accounted for in the cost-effectiveness calculation. Thus, the actual cost per
toxic pound-equivalent removed should be significantly less than the $3.62 presented here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of toxic weighting factors provides insight into the significance of pollutant discharges under the proposed
sanitizer exemption. As a result of the exemption under Option 3/S.1, total removals are reduced by 1,036 pounds relative
to the zero discharge requirement of Option 3 with the additonal non 272 PAIs taken into account. However, when evaluated
on a toxic-weighted basis, the reduction in removals is only 196 pounds-equivalent per year. This amount is only 0.002
percent of the industry toxic-weighted loadings of the 272 PAIs that would be removed by this regulation (about 12
million toxic weighted pounds). If toxic-weighted removals of non-272 PAIs were included in this comparison, the
percentage of toxic-weighted pounds exempt from this regulation would be even less.

Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

XV. Water Quality Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Most of the PAIs being regulated have at least one toxic effect (human health carcinogen and/or systemic toxicant
or aquatic toxicant). Many of these pollutants have the potential to bioaccumulate and persist in the environment.
Various studies have demonstrated the bioaccumulation of pesticides in aquatic life and accumulation of pesticides
in sediments. Documented human health impacts at pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging (PFPR) facilities
include respiratory disease and impaired liver function, primarily through worker exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous incidents of groundwater and soil contamination at refilling establishments, largely due to spills, are
identified in the Office of Pesticide Programs proposed ``Standards for Pesticide Containers and Containment''
(59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994). According to a 1991 study, an estimated 45 to 75 percent of the refilling establishments
in Wisconsin will require soil remediation and 29 to 63 percent of the commercial agrichemical facilities potentially
exceed the State's groundwater standards for pesticides. An estimated 40 to 50 percent of refilling establishments
in Iowa may require groundwater remediation. Seventy to 80 percent of the detections of pesticides in groundwater
in Kansas can be traced back to refilling establishments. Groundwater contamination by pesticides is documented
at numerous refilling establishments in Michigan, Illinois, and Utah. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The water quality benefits of controlling the indirect discharges from PFPR facilities are evaluated by modelling
the impact of those discharges on receiving streams. The effects of POTW wastewater discharges of 106 PAIs are evaluated
at current and proposed treatment levels for 81 indirect discharging PFPR facilities which discharge to 74 POTWs
on 72 receiving streams. Water quality models are used to project pollutant in-stream concentrations based on estimated
releases at current and Option 1 levels; the in-stream concentrations are then compared to EPA published water quality
criteria or to documented toxic effect levels where EPA water quality criteria are not available for certain PAIs.
Instream pollutant concentrations are modelled for Options 1, the highest wastewater load option; if no effects
are projected to occur for Option 1, none are projected to occur for the proposed option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The in-stream pollutant concentration for one pollutant is projected to exceed human health criteria or human toxic
effect levels in one receiving stream at current discharge levels. The in-stream pollutant concentrations for 21
pollutants are projected to exceed chronic aquatic life criteria or aquatic toxic effect levels in 18 streams at current
discharge levels. No exceedances of human health or aquatic life criteria or toxic effect levels are projected to
occur for Option 1; consequently, no exceedances are projected to occur for the proposed option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential impacts of these indirect discharging PFPR facilities are also evaluated in terms of inhibition of
POTW operation and contamination of sludge. Potential biological inhibition problems are projected to occur at
five POTWs for six PAIs; no sludge contamination problems are projected to occur at current discharge conditions.
No potential biological inhibition or sludge contamination problems are projected to occur for Option 1; consequently
no exceedances are projected to occur for the proposed option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The POTW inhibition and sludge values used in this analysis are not, in general, regulatory values. They are based
upon engineering and health estimates contained in guidance or guidelines published by EPA and other sources. Thus,
EPA is not basing its regulatory approach for pretreatment discharge levels upon the finding that some pollutants
interfere with POTWs by impairing their treatment effectiveness. However, the values used in the analysis do help
indicate the potential benefits for POTW operation that may result from the compliance with the proposed option.

XVI. Non-Water Quality Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The elimination or reduction of one form of pollution may create or aggravate other environmental problems. Therefore,
Sections 304(b) and 306 of the Act call for EPA to consider the non-water quality environmental impacts of effluent
limitations guidelines and standards. Accordingly, EPA has considered the effect of these regulations on air pollution,
solid waste generation, and energy consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Air Pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA estimates that facilities may emit 62,000 pounds of volatile priority pollutants during the treatment process
and an additional 114,000 pounds may be emitted through the reuse of the wastewaters. EPA does not anticipate significant
losses of active ingredients as most have low volatility. This loss would occur during the emulsion breaking, hydrolysis
and/or chemical oxidation treatment steps where the addition of heat is likely to promote the release of the priority
pollutants. The air emission estimate is based on the use of open vessels. Because EPA has developed costs for closed
vessels, our estimate is likely to over estimate the actual losses due to volatilization from treatment. It is possible
that there may be some emissions of priority pollutants during cleaning of equipment or containers, particularly
if high-pressure cleaning or steam cleaning is used. EPA invites comment and data that address this possibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates that without this regulation 968,000 pounds of volatile priority pollutants are being discharged
to POTW's. An estimated 784,000 pounds will be lost in the form of emissions as the water is treated by POTW's. Thus,
today's proposal will reduce the estimated quantity of volatile pollutants emitted by 791,000 pounds/year. In addition,
the emissions would be localized and more suitable for capture and treatment. EPA is also inviting comment and data
on the possible mechanisms and cost associated with capturing and treating these emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Solid Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA estimates there will be 2,038,000 pounds of sludge generated from emulsion breaking and sulfide precipitation
treatment annually. In addition 7,415,000 pounds annually of spent activated carbon will be generated annually.
The sludge and spent carbon are generated from treatment through the Universal Treatment System. EPA has assumed
that the sludge generated via emulsion breaking and sulfide precipitation will be hauled to hazardous waste incinerators.
It is assumed that the activated carbon will be sent off-site for regeneration, which means that it would not become
a waste. There is a possibility of air emissions being generated as a result of the incineration or regeneration of
spent activated carbonated treatment sludges and resulting in subsequent generation of wastewater from the air
pollution control scrubber usually associated with incinerators. However, hazardous waste incinerators are required
to destroy contaminants up to 99.99%, thus if there are any residuals they would be at very low concentration. EPA believes
this proposed regulation is consistent with the goals established for EPA's Draft Strategy for Combustion of Hazardous
Waste, May 1993. This draft combustion strategy which establishes as the first goal ``a strong preference for source
reduction over waste management, and thereby reduce the long-term demand for combustion and other waste management
facilities''.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Energy Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA estimates that the attainment of BAT, NSPS, PSES and PSNS will increase energy consumption by a small increment
over present industry use. The main energy requirement of the proposed technologies is the generation of steam that
is used in the treatment vessel to accomplish emulsion breaking and hydrolysis. Steam provides the heat energy to
assist with the separation of emulsified phases and increase the rate at which active ingredients hydrolyze. It is
estimated that about 120 million pounds per year of steam would be required by the Universal Treatment System. This
would require approximately 26,000 barrels of oil annually; the United States currently consumes about 19 million
barrels per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, EPA estimates that the operation of the Universal Treatment System will consume 1,760,000 kilowatt
hours per year. This is expended by the pumps and agitators used in treatment and associated with the storage of water
until it can be reused.

A. Upset and Bypass Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A recurring issue is whether industry limitations and standards should include provisions authorizing noncompliance
with effluent limitations during periods of ``upset'' or ``bypass''. An upset, sometimes called an ``excursion,''
is an unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology based effluent limitations occurring for reasons
beyond the reasonable control of the permittee. EPA believes that upset provisions are necessary to recognize an
affirmative defense for an exceptional incident including ``Acts of God''. Because technology-based limitations
can require only what properly designed, maintained and operated technology can achieve, it is claimed that liability
for such situations is improper. When confronted with this issue, courts have been divided on the question of whether
an explicit upset or excursion exemption is necessary or whether upset or excursion incidents may be handled through
EPA's exercise of enforcement discretion. (Compare Marathon Oil Co.

While an upset is an unintentional episode during which effluent limitations are exceeded, a bypass is an act of intentional
noncompliance during which wastewater treatment facilities are circumvented in emergency situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has both upset and bypass provisions in NPDES permits, and has promulgated NPDES and pretreatment regulations
which include upset and bypass permit provisions. (See 45 FR 33290, 33448 May 19, 1980; 40 CFR 122.60(g)(h), 40 CFR
403.16 and 403.17). The upset provision establishes an upset as an affirmative defense to prosecution for violation
of technology-based effluent limitations. The bypass provision authorizes bypassing to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage. Since the limitations and standards are proposed to be set at zero discharge and
there are already upset and bypass provisions in NPDES permits and pretreatment regulations, EPA will let local permit
and control authorities deal with individual upsets or requests for bypass.

B. Variances and Modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the promulgation of these regulations, the effluent limitations for the appropriate subcategory must be applied
in all Federal and State NPDES permits issued to direct dischargers in the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging
industry. In addition, the pretreatment standards are directly applicable to indirect dischargers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the proposed BPT effluent limitations (Subcategory E only), the only exception to the binding limitations is
EPA's ``fundamentally different factors'' (``FDF'') variance (40 CFR part 125, subpart D). This variance recognizes
factors concerning a particular discharger which are fundamentally different from the factors considered in this
rulemaking. Although this variance clause was set forth in EPA's 1973&hyph;1976 effluent guidelines, it is now included
in the NPDES regulations and not the specific industry regulations. (See 44 FR 32854, 32893 (June 7, 1979) for an explanation
of the ``fundamentally different factors'' variance). The procedures for application for a BPT FDF variance are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dischargers subject to the BAT limitations proposed in these regulations may also apply for an FDF variance, under
the provisions of sec. 301(n) of the Act, which regulates BAT, BCT, and pretreatment FDFs. In addition, BAT limitations
for nonconventional pollutants may be modified under sec. 301(c) (for economic reasons) and 301(g) (for water quality
reasons) of the Act. Under sec. 301(l) of the Act, these latter two statutory modifications are not applicable to ``toxic''
or conventional pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dischargers subject to pretreatment standards for existing sources are also subject to the ``fundamentally different
factors'' variance and credits for pollutants removed by POTWs, as discussed in Section XIII.E. Dischargers subject
to pretreatment standards for new sources are subject only to the removal credit provision (See Section XIII.E).
New sources subject to NSPS are not eligible for EPA's ``fundamentally different factors'' variance or any statutory
or regulatory modifications. (See

C. Relationship to NPDES Permits and Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BAT and NSPS limitations in today's proposed rule would be applied to individual pesticide plants through NPDES
permits issued by EPA or approved State agencies under section 402 of the Act. The preceding section of this preamble
discussed the binding effect of this regulation on NPDES permits, except when variances and modifications are expressly
authorized. This section adds more detail on the relation between this regulation and NPDES permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue is how this regulation will affect the powers of NPDES permit-issuing authorities. EPA has developed the
limitations and standards in the proposed rule to cover the typical facility for this point source category. This
regulation does not restrict the power of any permitting authority to act in any manner consistent with law or these
or any other EPA regulations, guideline, or policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A concern of permit writers, as well as local control authorities, may be the apparent contradiction of writing a discharge
permit for a zero discharge regulation. During development of the proposed regulation, EPA contacted a few permit
writers who wrote NPDES permits for facilities that reported zero discharge in the survey. EPA obtained copies of
these permits, and found that because the facilities still had wastewater discharges due to sanitary wastewater
or other non-PFPR operations, the permit writers were able to specify zero discharge of the PFPR process wastewater
streams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if a facility is totally no discharge, an NPDES permit may be requested by the facility to provide upset provisions
which would not apply to discharge in the absence of a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another topic of concern is the operation of EPA's NPDES enforcement program, which was an important consideration
in developing today's proposal. The Agency emphasizes that although the Clean Water Act is a strict liability statute,
EPA can initiate enforcement proceedings at its discretion. EPA has exercised and intends to exercise that discretion
in a manner that recognizes and promotes good faith compliance.

D. Best Management Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 304(e) of the Act authorizes the Administrator to prescribe ``best management practices'' (BMPs). EPA may
develop BMPs that apply to all industrial sites or to a designated industrial category and may offer guidance to permit
authorities in establishing management practices required by unique circumstances at a given plant. Dikes, curbs,
and other control measures are being used at some pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities to
contain leaks and spills as part of good ``housekeeping'' practices. Further, as described previously, the Office
of Pesticide Programs is proposing to require these secondary containment systems at refilling establishments
for agricultural pesticides. Due to the variety of products, formulation types and level of sophistication in the
formulating and packaging equipment, EPA believes that regulating this industry by BMPs in national effluent guidelines
regulations may not provide enough flexibility to the industry. However, on a facility-by-facility basis a permit
writer may choose to incorporate BMPs into the permit.

E. Analytical Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 304(h) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate guidelines establishing test methods for the analysis of pollutants.
These methods are used to determine the presence and concentration of pollutants in wastewater, and are used for compliance
monitoring and for filing applications for the NPDES program under 40 CFR 122.41(j)(4) and 122.21(g)(7), and for
the pretreatment program under 40 CFR 403.12(g)(4) and (h). To date, EPA has promulgated methods for conventional
pollutants, toxic pollutants, and for some nonconventional pollutants. The five conventional pollutants are defined
at 40 CFR 401.16. Table I&hyph;B at 40 CFR part 136 lists the analytical methods approved for these pollutants. The
65 toxic metals and organic pollutants and classes of pollutants are defined at 40 CFR 401.15. From the list of 65 classes
of toxic pollutants EPA identified a list of 126 ``Priority Pollutants.'' This list of Priority Pollutants is shown,
for example, at 40 CFR part 423, Appendix A. The list includes non-pesticide organic pollutants, metal pollutants,
cyanide, asbestos, and pesticide pollutants. Currently approved methods for metals and cyanide are included in
the table of approved inorganic test procedures at 40 CFR 136.3, Table I&hyph;B. Table I&hyph;C at 40 CFR 136.3 lists
approved methods for measurement of non-pesticide organic pollutants, and Table I&hyph;D lists approved methods
for the toxic pesticide pollutants and for other pesticide pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the analytical methods for pesticide active ingredients contained in the promulgated pesticide
manufacturing effluent guidelines and standards (see Methods for the Determination of Nonconventional Pesticides
in Municipal and Industrial Wastewater, Volumes I &amp; II, EPA 821&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;010&hyph;A&amp;B, August
1993, Revision 1) will perform equally well on treated pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewaters
as on pesticide manufacturing wastewaters. Raw wastewater samples may on occasion require some separation prior
to analysis, analogous to the emulsion breaking or chemically assisted clarification treatment included in EPA's
costed BAT technology. Many of these methods have in fact been used on the PFPR sampled wastewaters. All of the active
ingredient pollutant data that supports the proposed effluent limitations were generated using analytical methods
that employ the latest in analytical technology. EPA may decide to promulgate these methods (which are contained
in part 455) as allowable methods under 40 CFR part 136. However, EPA expects that monitoring of process flow will generally
be the method used by permitting and Control Authorities to assure compliance with today's proposal. See section
XIV of the Technical Development for a discussion of compliance monitoring.

XVIII. Solicitation of Data and Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA invites and encourages public participation in this rulemaking. The Agency asks that comments address any perceived
deficiencies in the record of this proposal and that suggested revisions or corrections be supported by data where
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA particularly requests comments and information on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The data collected during the study of this industry demonstrate a great potential for reusing residual wastewater
in products. EPA is concerned that there may be some circumstances in which some residual wastewater volume may need
to be disposed primarily through incineration. We believe these volumes will be small, however some large production
facilities may have relatively large residual volumes. EPA solicits data on the magnitude of volumes, their sources,
their pollutant concentrations, what actions have been taken or will be taken to reduce their volume and the amount
of reduction that the action has or will accomplish and the cost of achieving such reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Early in the process of developing regulatory options, EPA gave some consideration to the option of allowing an
exemption from regulation if a facility were able to comply with a ``deminimus'' volume. EPA was unable to develop
this option beyond conceptualization because there was no real basis on which to make the determination what constitutes
a ``deminimus'' volume. EPA solicits the same type of data from facilities as described above and from POTWs on the
volumes, and pollutant concentrations which could be representative of a ``deminimus'' volume, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 whether PFPR loadings have caused harm to POTWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA requests comment and suggestions on the best approach for notifying the PFPR facilities affected by this rule
about the best practices, equipment and process changes observed at facilities that lead to pollution prevention,
recycle, reuse and water conservation. EPA is presently considering publishing in conjunction with the promulgated
rule a separate report dealing with pollution prevention practices or perhaps producing a videotape to broadcast
the message. EPA invites comments and suggestions about what would be the most effective approach, content and format
to publicize the best pollution prevention practices that are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) EPA made a number of assumptions to calculate how much wastewater would either be reused in product, treated and
reused as wastewater, or sent for off-site incineration. As discussed in the ``Cost Estimates'' section of this preamble
and in the technical Development Document, if volumes of interior wastewater exceeded 50% of the total volume of inert
ingredients EPA estimated the excess would either be treated and reused or treated off-site at considerable expense
($8.13/gallon). Given that this assumption does not in any way account for water conservation practices which EPA
believes could be applied in many cases, (but did not attempt to apply given that site-specific information was not
available), do the assumptions in the cost analysis tend to understate or overstate the costs of EPA's preferred option?
Could the actual costs differ enough to suggest adoption of a non-zero discharge approach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In this proposed rule, EPA does exempt from zero discharge requirements exterior wastestreams from sanitizer
pesticides. This exemption is based, in part, on the small amount of discharge that occurs from these wastewaters,
the toxicity of these active ingredients, and the disproportionate impact regulating these wastestreams would
have on small business. EPA solicits comment on whether any individual active ingredient, any other class of active
ingredient or any sector of the pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging industry merits consideration
of an exemption from the zero discharge standard based on any or all of the above characteristics. An example of a sector
is a group of firms with a minimum 50 percent of pesticide revenue from a particular market, for example agricultural,
non-agricultural professional use products, industrial, etc. as described in Table 5 of this preamble and the cost
effectiveness report. Commenters are encouraged to provide additional information or data that supports different
approaches for different pollutants, including information on quantity of pollutants discharged and costs to affected
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will conduct additional analyses of the amount of discharge (including estimating the total number of pound-equivalents
removed) and any disproportionate impacts on businesses for individual active ingredients, classes of active ingredients,
or sectors of industry as feasible and appropriate. Where appropriate EPA will announce the availability of this
analysis in the
