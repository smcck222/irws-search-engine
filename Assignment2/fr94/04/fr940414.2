<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 14, 1994, the Forest Service published an interim policy, with a request for public comment, on the agency's
role in regulating the placement of bait on National Forest System lands (59 FR 11765). This notice withdraws the interim
policy and republishes it as a proposed policy. The intended effect of the proposed policy is to clarify the agency's
role in relation to the role of the States and, thus, to provide a consistent approach to the regulation of baiting resident
game. Public comment is invited and will be considered in the adoption of a final policy, notice of which will be published
in the

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State fish and wildlife agencies have the primary responsibility for protection and management of wildlife populations
on National Forest System lands, including adoption of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations affecting the
taking of resident game animals. The Forest Service enters into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each State
which governs Forest Service/State cooperation on matters of Statewide fish and wildlife policy or procedure affecting
the National Forest System (FSM 2611.1). The States issue regulations regarding hunting licenses, methods, seasons,
locations, and bag limits for resident game and have the primary responsibility for enforcement of fish and wildlife
laws and regulations on National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal land management statutes acknowledge the States' traditional role in managing fish and wildlife; see the
National Forest System Organic Administration Act at 16 U.S.C. 480, the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act at 16 U.S.C.
528, the Sikes Act at 16 U.S.C. 670h, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, at 43 U.S.C. 1732. The Forest Service,
therefore, is generally reluctant to override State fish and wildlife regulation, except where federal interests,
such as protection of forest land, resources, and users, require federal intervention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The practice of placing bait (food or scent to attract wildlife) is a hunting activity subject to State laws and regulations.
The baiting of bears is particularly controversial. While the total number of States allowing bear baiting has declined,
State fish and wildlife agencies permit the baiting of black bear as a hunting activity in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Maine,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin,and Wyoming. The Forest Service intends to work
diligently through its ongoing cooperative efforts to encourage the States to evaluate their regulation of the practice
of baiting bears. In the meantime, the agency is issuing proposed policy regarding the use of bait on National Forest
System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, some national forests have regulated the placement of bear baits by requiring hunters and commercial
guides to obtain special use authorizations in order to prevent conflicts with other users or other problems associated
with the location and removal of bait. Additionally, some Forest Service Regions have issued orders under 36 CFR part
261 to control litter, as well as to close certain areas to bear baiting where the practice would create unacceptable
adverse effects on other resources or forest users. Special use authorizations for bear baiting had been issued on
a number of national forests in Wyoming. Typically, those special use authorizations included conditions with which
the holder had to comply to minimize adverse effects created by placement of bear bait. In early 1992, the Forest Service's
role in the regulation of bear baiting on the national forests in Wyoming became an issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1992, the Regional Foresters for the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain Regions issued a joint closure order
prohibiting bear baiting in the national forests in Wyoming, unless the baiting activity was conducted in compliance
with the requirements of the order pertaining to the placement and disposal of baits. Like the conditions that previously
had been included in special use authorizations, the requirements of the order were intended to minimize adverse
effects on forest resources and users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fund for Animals and the Friends of the Bow brought suit to challenge the Forest Service's closure order and to challenge
what Plaintiffs considered a shift in established policy, that is, no longer requiring special use authorizations
for bear bait placement and using closure orders instead (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (D.D.C. Civ. No.92&hyph;1694&hyph;TPJ)). These groups perceived this shift in method as a diminution in the level
of Forest Service regulation and wildlife protection. The parties settled the case upon the Forest Service's decision
to rescind the closure order and, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, to analyze the effects
of eliminating the practice of issuing special use authorizations for the placement of bear bait on National Forest
System lands in Wyoming. The Regions then prepared an Environmental Assessment to disclose effects of the proposed
action and alternatives to that proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of the Environmental Assessment and issuance of a Decision Notice by the Rocky Mountain and Intermountain
Regional Foresters in April 1993, there were new challenges to the agency's position. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief
for the National Forest System decided that national direction was needed to end the conflict and controversy. Accordingly,
the Decision Notice was rescinded, and bear baiting in national forests in Wyoming was prohibited pending issuance
of national direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim policy was issued by the Forest Service, on March 4, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1994, a lawsuit was filed by the fund for Animals and others, in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia challenging, in part, the absence of a public comment period prior to issuance of the interim policy. In
a stipulation to stay proceedings in the suit, the agency agreed to withdraw the interim policy and republish it as
proposed with a 60-day public comment period prior to issuance of a final policy. As a result, effective March 30, 1994,
the Forest Service policy on bear baiting reverted to that which was in effect prior to the interim policy of March 14.

Proposed Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service special use authorization regulations at 36 CFR 251.50 exempt noncommercial use and occupancy,
including ``hunting,'' from the special use authorization requirement. Since hunting methods subject to State
regulation are included within the term ``hunting,'' the proposed policy makes explicit that, where State regulations
permit baiting, the Forest Service would prohibit the practice of issuing a special use authorization for the practice
of baiting connected with hunting on National Forest System lands. However, outfitter and guide activities still
require special use authorization and, as a condition of that authorization, outfitters and guides must comply with
applicable State laws and regulations as well as any applicable Forest Service closure orders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, if the placement of bait should become a land or resource management issue and if it is determined that the
State regulations governing baiting would not protect resources in an area adequately or would otherwise be inconsistent
with the applicable forest plan or conflict with federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act, then, under the proposed
policy, the authorized officer would issue an order to close the area to baiting. The authorized officer also could
close an area to baiting after considering the likely impact on a site-specific basis on water quality, public health
and sanitation, or the potential threat to the viability of wildlife. Finally, the proposed policy would explicitly
prohibit the practice of issuing a special use authorization to individuals for the specific act of placing bait on
National Forest system lands for hunting purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach contemplated in the proposed policy maintains protection of national forest resources. First, under
the terms of the Memorandums of Understanding with the State fish and wildlife or game agencies, the Forest Service
continuously participates in the review and adoption of State game regulations as they affect National Forest System
land or resources. Second, the proposed policy would provide the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor with the
flexibility and discretion to determine if baiting should be prohibited in a specific location. Finally, if a hunter,
in placing bait to attract resident game creates litter through improper placement or untimely removal of bait in
violation of State regulations or Forest Service closure orders, the agency has the authority under its regulations
at 36 CFR 261.11 to cite the hunter for violating the prohibition on litter. If such bait results in violation of State
regulations, the agency also has authority to cite the hunter for violation of 36 CFR 261.8, and agency employees routinely
do so where such violations occur. In short, the agency's proposed approach (1) relies on existing relationships
with each State, (2) prevents duplicative regulation by Federal and State agencies, and (3) provide site-specific
environmental safeguards to address those situations where baiting would have an adverse site-specific effect
on National Forest System land or resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed baiting policy would be an amendment to the Forest Service Manual. Accordingly, pursuant to 36 CFR part
216, the text of the proposed policy is set out at the end of this notice. Public comment is invited and will be considered
in adoption of a final policy.

Publication of this proposed policy is an integral part of the agency's scoping process by which it determines the
scope and level of any environmental effects of proposed actions. According to the agency NEPA procedures, scoping
is required for all proposed actions, including those that might be categorically excluded. Section 31.1b(2) of
Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in an environmental
assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Service-wide administrative procedures,
program processes, or instructions.'' This proposed policy would provide administrative instructions to Forest
Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of placing bait for resident game. Accordingly,
the agency's preliminary assessment is that this policy falls within this category of actions and that no extraordinary
circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.
The agency particularly invites comment on this preliminary finding. Following consideration of public comments,
the Forest Service will make a final determination regarding the level of environmental analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Forest Service organizes its directive system by alpha-numeric codes and subject headings. Only those sections
of the Forest Service Manual including policy direction that are the subject of this notice are set out here. The proposed
policy includes minor revisions to existing codes and subject headings. The audience for this direction is Forest
Service employees responsible for coordinating wildlife management on National Forest System lands with State
fish and wildlife agencies.

2643_Applicability of State Fish and Wildlife laws and Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service actively cooperates in the development of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations and may
assist in the enforcement of State fish and wildlife laws on National Forest System lands. Pursuant to FSM 2610, Regional
Foresters shall ensure that memorandums with State fish and wildlife agencies recognize the role of the Forest Service
in cooperating in the development of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations, especially those addressing hunting,
fishing, and trapping as they would apply to occupancy and use of National Forest System lands.

2643.1_Hunting, Fishing, and Trapping Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hunting, fishing, and trapping of fish and wildlife and associated practices are permitted on National Forest System
lands subject to State fish and wildlife laws and regulations, unless one or both of the following apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. State fish and wildlife laws and regulations conflict with federal laws; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. State laws and regulations would permit activities that conflict with the land and resource management responsibilities
of the Forest Service or that are inconsistent with forest plans.

2643.12_Use of Bait for Resident Game Hunting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of bait as a lure or attractant for the purpose of taking resident game on National Forest System lands is considered
a hunting practice subject to State regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where State hunting regulations prohibit the use of bait, the practice is prohibited on National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where States permit the use of bait for attracting resident game, this activity is allowed on National Forest System
lands, subject to State hunting laws and regulations, unless the authorized officer determines on a site-specific
basis that there is a need to prohibit or restrict the practice of baiting because one or more of the following circumstances
exist:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State laws and regulations on placement of bait are inadequate to protect forest land or other resources or users
in a particular location and/or to prevent trespass or litter; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Baiting is inconsistent with the applicable forest plan; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The State laws and regulations conflict with Federal law, such as the Endangered Species Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the mandatory causes for prohibiting or restricting baiting, the authorized officer also may prohibit
baiting, regardless of the adequacy of State regulations, based on consideration of the likely impact of baiting
on such matters as water quality, public health and sanitation, the potential for litter, or the potential to threaten
the viability of wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the authorized officer determines that baiting is a significant problem and should be restricted or prohibited:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The officer shall notify State fish and wildlife officials and provide them the opportunity to resolve the issue
through further restrictions or the prohibition through State regulation rather than for the Forest Service to issue
the restriction or prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the State does not revise its regulations to adequately regulate or restrict baiting, the Forest Service authorized
officer shall, time permitting close the area or otherwise restrict baiting by issuing an order pursuant to 36 CFR
part 261. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where time does not permit closure of an area to baiting because the hunting season is underway and it would be impracticable
to issue a closure order, the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor shall take such mitigation and/or enforcement
measures as are appropriate and practicable to ensure consistency with forest plan management direction and compliance
with Federal laws, orders, and regulations, and protection for forest users and resources. For example, the agency
may close a road or gate, or cite violations of other State or Forest Service regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure is not the only way to address the practice of baiting. It is expected that land managers as part of their day-to-day
management of National Forest System lands and resources will be cognizant of the effects of hunting activities and
take such proactive measures, after consultation with the responsible fish and wildlife agency, such as hunter education,
as may be necessary to ensure resource protection consistent with forest plan management direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy, in and of itself, does not compel an authorized officer to undertake a specific decision or to make a determination
of whether baiting is allowed in the those States where the practice is permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special use authorization shall not be issued for placing bait on National Forest System lands for hunting purposes
(36 CFR 251.50(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this section and to assure consistency in coordination of national forest wildlife matters with
State agencies, the authorized officer is the Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor responsible for executing
memorandums of understanding with the State wildlife agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Amendment 6 to the FMP was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented
by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C. Amendment 6,
also called the ``Limited-Entry Plan'', is intended to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish fishing
fleet by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Limiting the overall number of vessels,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Limiting the number of vessels using each of the three major gear types, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Limiting increases in vessel harvest capacity by limiting vessel length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 663.34(a)(3) of the implementing regulations provides that small limited-entry fisheries that are controlled
by a local government, are in existence as of July 11, 1991, and have negligible impacts on the groundfish resource,
may be certified as consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6 and incorporated into the limited-entry fishery.
If a fleet is certified and incorporated into the limited-entry fishery, vessels in the fleet at the time of incorporation
will be issued limited-entry permits with ``A'' endorsements for the appropriate gear. A permit issued to a vessel
in a certified fleet is only valid when the vessel is operating under and in conformance with the certified program.
Such a permit and endorsement may be transferred to another vessel that will operate in the same certified fleet, provided
the total number of vessels in the fleet does not increase. If more vessels are added to a fleet in a certified limited-entry
program, these additional vessels will not receive ``A'' endorsements unless the program is recertified for the
greater number of vessels, and the larger fleet incorporated into the limited-entry fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon application by a representative of a small limited-entry fleet, the Regional Director, after receiving a recommendation
from the Council, may incorporate the fleet into the limited-entry fishery, if the Regional Director:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Determines that the fleet has a negligible impact on the groundfish resource, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Certifies the activities of the fleet as consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 27, 1993, a representative of the Newport Beach dory fishing fleet of southern California requested that the
Regional Director incorporate the small, local dory fleet of 15 vessels into the limited-entry fishery. The Newport
Beach dory fishermen's fleet was founded in 1891 and is recognized as a historical landmark by the Newport Beach Historical
Society. The City of Newport Beach, CA, has reserved an area west of the Newport Pier exclusively for the dory fleet
operations. Dory fishermen provide fresh fish each day to a market run by the dory fleet. The City of Newport Beach adopted
policy guidelines on November 23, 1987, that serve to limit the size of the fleet and the size of the vessels that belong
to the fleet. The size of the fleet is limited by the city by restricting the number of storage sheds permitted on the
beach to 19, and by limiting the number of vessels to one per shed. Currently 15 sheds are utilized by longline groundfish
fishermen; 2 sheds by net, crab, and lobster fishermen; and 2 sheds are used as offices. Any new entrant to the fleet
must buy out one of the current shed owners in order to join the fleet. Vessel size is limited to about 20 ft (6.1 m) in length
or less by the requirement that the vessels be launched and landed from the beach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its recognition by the Newport Beach Historical Society and the policy guidelines adopted November 23, 1987,
by the City of Newport Beach, the Regional Director has determined that the Newport Beach dory fleet is ``controlled
by a local government,'' and was ``in existence as of July 11, 1991.'' The Regional Director also concluded that the
fleet has unique cultural and social importance and is dependent on the Pacific groundfish fishery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 18, 1993, NMFS submitted the request for incorporation of the dory fleet to the Council for its review and recommendation.
At its September, 1993, meeting, the Council tentatively approved incorporation of the Newport Beach dory fleet
under the groundfish license limited-entry program, pending the provision of information to NMFS from the City of
Newport Beach that confirms an effective local limited-entry program is in place and the provision of other information
necessary to complete the fleet's application (e.g., identification numbers for vessels included in the fleet).
NMFS has received the information requested by the Council and is satisfied that the City of Newport Beach adequately
controls both the number and size of the vessels that participate in the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination of California landing records for 1990 indicated that the Newport Beach dory fleet landed about 152,000
pounds (68.9 mt) of sablefish. Given that the total West Coast nontrawl sablefish landings were in excess of 3,600
mt (nearly 8 million pounds), the Regional Director has determined that the Newport Beach dory fleet harvest, which
represents less than 2 percent of the total nontrawl harvest, has a negligible impact on the groundfish resource.
Based on the factors described above, the Regional Director certifies that the operation of the Newport Beach dory
fleet is consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6 and has incorporated the dory fleet into the limited-entry
fishery. NMFS will issue limited-entry permits to the current members of the Newport Beach dory fleet. Such permits
can only be used by vessels operating in the dory fleet.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, the State of New Jersey and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to conduct public scoping meetings to present a
preliminary draft management plan outline for the proposed Mullica River-Great Bay National Estuarine Research
Reserve and to solicit comments on significant issues related to the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact
Statement (DEIS) and Draft Management Plan (DMP). THe DEIS and DMP will address research, monitoring, education
and resource protection needs for the Reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In October 1993, NOAA approved the nomination of Mullica River-Great Bay in New Jersey as a proposed research reserve.
Research reserves provide natural coastal habitats as field laboratories for baseline ecological studies and education
programs. Research and monitoring programs are designed to enhance basis scientific understanding of the coastal
environment and aid in resource management decision making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mullica River-Great Bay Reserve is proposed to be managed by the Rutgers University, Institute of Marine and Coastal
Science (IMCS) in cooperation with the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy's (DEPE) Office of Land
and Water Planning. Since the 1970's, the Institute's marine field station at Tuckerton has been the site of some of
the earliest east coast research on estuarine systems and continues to provide research and education opportunities
for investigators from universities throughout the country to study coastal system dynamics. These research activities
have generated biological and geological data that will be of immense value to furthering the long-term research
and education goals of the Reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Institute has developed a preliminary draft management plan outline for the Reserve which identifies specific
needs and priorities related to research, monitoring, education, and resource protection at the approved site.
It also outlines an administration plan, volunteer program and facilities development needs; public access, and
visitor use policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the public meetings, DEPE, IMCS, and NOAA will provide a synopsis of the process for developing a DMP and will solicit
comments on significant environmental issues that will be incorporated into a DEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public meetings will be held from 2 p.m.&hyph;4 p.m. and from 6 p.m.&hyph;8 p.m. on Monday, May 2, 1994, at the Little
Egg Harbor Township Hall, 7 Gifford Road, Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey 08087.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties who wish to submit suggestions, comments or substantive information regarding the scope or content
of the proposed DEIS/DMP are invited to attend either of the above meetings. Parties who wish to respond in writing
should do so by May 16, 1994, to Ms. Dolores Washington, Program Specialist, Sanctuaries and Reserves Division, Office
of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, NOAA, SSMC4, suite 12155, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

Voluntary abandonment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is a defense to an attempt offense that the person voluntarily and completely abandoned the intended crime, because
of a genuine change of heart, prior to the completion of the crime. Voluntary abandonment because of a ``genuine change
of heart'' means that the attempted crime was abandoned solely because of the person's own sense that it was wrong.
The voluntary abandonment defense is not allowed if the abandonment results, in whole or in part, from other reasons,
for example, the person feared detection or apprehension, decided to await a better opportunity for success, was
unable to complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated difficulties or unexpected resistance. A person who
is entitled to the defense of voluntary abandonment may nonetheless be guilty of a lesser included, completed offense.
For example, a person who voluntarily abandoned an attempted armed robbery may nonetheless be quilty of assault with
a dangerous weapon.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nature of offense.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This offense differs from malingering (see paragraph 40) in that for this offense, the accused need not have harbored
a design to avoid performance of any work, duty, or service which may properly or normally be expected of one in the military
service. This offense is characterized by intentional self-injury under such circumstances as prejudice good order
and discipline or discredit the armed forces. It is not required that the accused be unable to perform duties, or that
the accused actually be absent from his or her place or duty as a result of the injury. For example, the accused may inflict
the injury while on leave or pass. The circumstances and extent of injury, however, are relevant to a determination
that the accused's conduct was prejudicial to good order and discipline, or service-discrediting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
How injury inflicted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The injury may be inflicted by nonviolent as well as by violent means and may be accomplished by any act or omission which
produces, prolongs, or aggravates a sickness or disability. Thus, voluntary starvation which results is debility
is a self-inflicted injury. Similarly, the injury may be inflicted by another at the accused's request.

Maximum punishment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The maximum punishment for subsection (1) reflects the serious effect that this offense may have on readiness and
morale. The maximum punishment reflected the range of the effects of the injury, both in degree and duration, on the
ability of the accused to perform work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for subsection (1) is equivalent
to that for offenses of desertion, missing movement through design, and certain violations of orders. The maximum
punishment for subsection (2) is less than the maximum punishment for the offense of malingering under the same circumstances
because of the absence of the specific intent to avoid work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for subsection
(2) is equivalent to that for nonaggravated offenses of desertion, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned
officer, and nonaggravated malingering by intentional self-inflicted injury.

Sample specification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 See appendix 4, paragraph 177 of MCM, U.S. Army, 1949. Since incapacitation to perform duties is not an element of the
offense, language relating to ``unfitting himself for the full performance of military service'' from the 1949 MCM
has been omitted. The phrase ``willfully injure'' has been changed to read ``intentionally injure'' to parallel
the language contained in the malingering specification under Article 115.''

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Helium Act (Pub. L. 86&hyph;777) (50 U.S.C. 167a, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Department of the Interior's implementing regulations (30 CFR parts 601 and 602) require Federal agencies
to procure all major helium requirements from the Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been the Department of the Interior's policy, consistent with Congressional intent that Government helium
be used in Government contracts, and that all Government contracts involving the use of significant amounts of helium
require that Government helium be used in performing the contract. The appropriate vehicle for the establishment
of requirements pertaining to Government procurement is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current FAR coverage on the subject references 30 CFR parts 601 and 602. These are Department of the Interior regulations
dealing with helium sales and helium distribution. However, the FAR contains no substantive guidance on procurement
of helium and does not require submission of information that will permit the Bureau of Mines to ascertain whether
Federal agencies are using Government helium and are requiring in their contracts that Government helium be used
in contracted-for work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new FAR coverage provides an appropriate level of guidance on the subject, including a requirement that offerors
responding to contract solicitations provide information as to their forecast of helium required for performance
of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such information will facilitate enforcement of the requirements of the Helium Act and the contractual provisions
requiring the use of Government helium by agency contractors, in that it will permit corrective action to be taken
if the Bureau of Mines, after comparing helium sales data against helium requirement forecasts, discovers apparent
serious discrepancies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information is used in administration of certain Federal contracts to ensure contractor compliance with contract
clauses. Without the information, the required use of Government helium cannot be monitored and enforced effectively.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pinellas Area Office (PAO) awarded an organizational planning grant to The Enterprise Corporation of Tampa Bay
(TEC) in August 19, 1993. Under the grant, the TEC defined thirteen (13) separate support projects to accomplish economic
development goals for the Tampa Bay, Florida area. Under the follow on cooperative agreement awarded on February
28, 1994, the TEC will complete development of, implement, and administer these projects. Most of these projects
will be funded as subawards by TEC based on established award criteria. These awards will provide community impact
assistance funding to mitigate defense downsizing and eventual plant closure of the DOE's Pinellas Plant in Largo,
Florida. The projects will attempt to maximize reuse of the existing Pinellas Plant facilities to (1) create jobs
that will employ dislocated Pinellas plant employees and subcontractors, (2) stimulate local economic growth,
(3) promote the commercialization of site-developed technology, and (4) reuse DOE facilities compatibly with the
site's continuing mission in a manner consistent with environmental requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The projects to be implemented under the current cooperative agreement with TEC will cover many facets necessary
for economic development, including but not limited to the following: Small business incubator sites, small business
Research &amp; Development awards, Challenge awards for small to medium-sized businesses, a proposal assistance
center, an outrearch program, a Manufacturing Technology Center, a Technology Deployment Center, plant personnel
economic development incentives, a Technology Training Center, the Center for International Enterprise Development,
a Small Business Development Center, an enterprise investment fund, and facility refurbishment projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent is to provide this financial assistance primarily through TEC, as the single best source. Total efforts
may reach $50M over the next several years. For information on any of the projects listed above and evaluation criteria
for award projects please contact the individual listed below.

Scoping Process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In gathering background information for preparation of an environmental document for the issuance of a Federal hydropower
license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant environmental
issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects. The staff will
review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also deemphasize insignificant
issues narrowing the scope of the environmental document as well. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues
presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues
will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis will be given.

When a Declaration of Intention is filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Power Act requires
the Commission to investigate and determine if the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected
by the project. The Commission also determines whether the project: (1) Would be located on a navigable waterway;
(2) would occupy or affect public lands or reservations of the United States; (3) would utilize surplus water or water
power from a government dam; or (4) if applicable, has involved or would involve any construction subsequent to 1935
that may have increased or would increase the project's head or generating capacity, or have otherwise significantly
modified the project's pre-1935 design or operation.

TGPL states that Pennzoil, the sole operator of natural gas production being transported by the subject facilities,
recently constructed a new pipeline to re-route the existing SMI Block 23 gas (and other Pennzoil gas production)
to the system of Sea Robin Pipeline Company. Pennzoil has informed TGPL that, as a result of this re-routing, Pennzoil
will no longer ship any gas through the subject facilities and that, commencing July 7, 1994, Pennzoil will abandon
by removal its SMI Block 23A, 23B&hyph;D and 23B&hyph;P Platforms. TGPL states that it will be required to disconnect
and remove its facilities from these platforms before they are abandoned by Pennzoil. TGPL states that it must commence
work on or about June 15, 1994, in order to complete the disconnecting and removal of its facilities. Therefore, TGPL
requests the Commission take appropriate action to grant this authority on an expedited basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 15,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214)
and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party in any proceeding herein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the
Commission's rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing
will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene
is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and
approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave
to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that formal hearing is required, further
notice of such hearing will be duly given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The single exception is that Public Law 95&hyph;348 contains a provision preserving funds appropriated for use by
the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI). Section 3(a)(2) provides that any funds made available to the NMI by the Congress
after March 24, 1976, ``*&blank;*&blank;* are hereby authorized to remain available until expended.'' Accordingly,
Title VI funds allotted to the NMI under the authority of Public Law 103&hyph;124 are not subject to the recision of
funds under the provisions of Public law 103&hyph;211. The table at the end of this notice lists the revised amount
of funding made available to each State to capitalize SRF programs authorized by Title VI of the CWA. Grants from this
allotment may be awarded as of the date of this notice.

On February 10, 1993, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Iowa (Region 15). On February 3, 1994, Region
15 submitted a proposed amendment to its plan that would reserve all unassigned channels for the State of Iowa. Because
the proposed amendment is a major change to the Region 15 plan, the Commission is soliciting comments from the public
before taking action. (See Report and Order, General Docket No. 87&hyph;112, 3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before May 16, 1994 and reply comments on or before
May 31, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554 and should clearly identify them as submissions to PR Docket 92&hyph;288 Iowa-Public
Safety Region 15.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated March 30, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Alabama resulting from severe storms, tornadoes,
and flooding on March 27, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster
declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I,
therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Alabama.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance and Public Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with
the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public
Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.

Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Melvin Schneider of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act
as the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide

802(b)(3)(B) of the act sets forth the requirements that must be met in an application for approval. Section 802(b)(3)(C)
of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine whether the requirements
of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires that the agency publish a notice

therapy for short-term administration for the treatment of synovitis of asteoarthritis, acute and subacute bursitis,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications SN 07/401,141 and 07/892,485, both entitled ``A Method
for the Treatment of Dopaminergic Neurodegenerative Disorders'' to Phoenix: Regenerative Technologies, Inc.
of Peoria, Illinois. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. This prospective exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published
notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The patent applications disclose a novel surgical implantation method, which comprises implantation, into the
brain, of suitable histocompatible leukocytes activates by such agents as plant mitogens, lymphokines, and cytokines.
The claimed process offers an improved method of treating Parkinson's disease and other diseases that affect the
dopaminergic system. This therapy can reduce or totally eliminate L&hyph;Dopa therapy, which has significant toxic
side effects, and also presents an alternative to fetal implantation therapy. Use of the patient's own autologous
leukocytes is also convenient and reduces the chance of host rejection.

Robert W. May, M.D.; Denial of Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 16, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) issued an Order to Show Cause to Robert W. May, Jr., M.D., of 200 South Tennessee Street, Cartersville,
Georgia 30120. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Dr. May's pending application for a DEA Certificate of Registration.
The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. May by registered mail. The return receipt was never forwarded to DEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to ensure that Dr. May was aware of the Order to Show Cause, two DEA Diversion Investigators traveled to
Dr. May's address in Cartersville on July 1, 1993. A DEA Diversion Investigator handed Dr. May another copy of the Order
to Show Cause and explained its significance to him. Dr. May replied that he had indeed received the original Order
to Show Cause but had thrown it in the trash because he did not want to fight the Federal bureaucracy. As of March 1, 1994,
Dr. May had not requested a hearing nor had he filed any statement on his behalf. Consequently, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d),
Dr. May is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. The Administrator now enters his final order in this
matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file as is provided for in 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. May's registration with the DEA would be inconsistent with the public interest
as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). The investigative file reveals that on December 19, 1986, in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Dr. May was convicted of fifteen counts of distributing
and dispensing controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1),
and forty counts of aiding and abetting the same in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2. Dr. May was placed
on probation for a period of five years and was prohibited from prescribing Schedule II and III controlled substances
during the probation period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigative file further reveals that the Composite Board of Medical Examiners (Board) issued a Consent Order,
effective February 16, 1988, suspending Dr. May's medical license for thirty days. The Consent Order also placed
his medical license on probation for a period of five years, to run concurrently with the probation imposed by the United
States District Court, required Dr. May to provide at least 500 hours of free medical services to the community and
ordered Dr. May to partake in 250 hours of continuing education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Consent Order precluded Dr. May from applying for renewal of his DEA Certificate of Registration
without the prior written approval of the Board. The Board stipulated that such approval would not be granted until
Dr. May had complied with all the conditions of his probations, including specified continuing education requirements.
As of February 1994, Dr. May had not received such approval from the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 823(f) of the Controlled Substances Act lists five factors which are to be considered when making a determination
as to whether a registration would be in the public interest. These factors include: (1) The recommendation of the
appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing,
or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal
or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance
with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which
may threaten the public health and safety. The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors
when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S.,
51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks, M.D., 52 FR 41030 (1986).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Administrator concludes that Dr. May's registration would be inconsistent with
the public interest. The Administrator finds that due to Dr. May's past practice of distributing and dispensing controlled
substances in the absence of a legitimate medical purpose, Dr. May cannot be entrusted with a DEA Certificate of Registration.
His criminal conviction for this conduct and the action taken against his state medical license by the Board provide
ample foundation for this conclusion. Dr. May's failure to respond to the Order to Show Cause, either by requesting
a hearing or by submitting a written statement, indicates that he is either unwilling or unable to proffer support
for his application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him
by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 21 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that Dr. May's application for registration with the DEA
as a practitioner be, and it hereby is, denied.

<DOCTITLE>Michael D. Lawton, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 16, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Michael D. Lawton, M.D., 1751 West Romneya, Suite C, Anaheim,
California 92801. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Dr. Lawton's (Respondent) DEA Certificate of Registration,
BL2125068, and deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged
that such action was proper in light of the fact that on June 19, 1992, the Medical Board of California, Division of Medical
Quality (Board), revoked Respondent's state medical license. Respondent, therefore, was no longer authorized
by the State of California to handle controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 2, 1993, Respondent filed a request for a hearing on the matter. The matter was placed on the docket of Administrative
Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. On August 2, 1993, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition. Attached to and
in support of its motion, the Government filed a copy of the Board's Decision ordering the revocation of Respondent's
California Physician and Surgeon's license effective July 19, 1992. The Board revoked Respondent's license based
on its finding that Respondent was guilty of, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
gross negligence in his treatment of patients, furnishing controlled substances without a prior good faith examination
and without medical indication, prescribing and administering excessive amounts of controlled substances and
gross negligence and unprofessional conduct arising from sexual relations with patients. On August 23, 1993, the
administrative law judge issued his opinion and recommended decision granting the Government's motion for summary
disposition and recommending that the Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BL2125068, be revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 31, 1993, Respondent filed a request for reconsideration of the administrative law judge's recommendation
alleging, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the Board's decision was an ``obvious forgery.'' Respondent denied that the Board had ever revoked his medical
license. Respondent further stated that the Board ``has never initiated any discipline of [my] license.'' In response,
on September 15, 1993, the Government filed certified copies of the Board's decision, dated June 19, 1992, and of the
Board's accusations, dated January 23, 1992, and April 14, 1992, all relating to Respondent's California Physician
and Surgeon's Certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order and recommendation dated September 16, 1993, the administrative law judge noted that Respondent's allegation
of falsity of the Board's decision was a collateral attack and was not a matter appropriate for consideration in the
Federal proceeding. The administrative law judge added that Respondent failed to offer even a ``scintilla'' of evidence
to support his argument that the Board's order had been forged. The administrative law judge therefore ruled that
his prior recommended ruling granting summary disposition would remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that the Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register a practitioner who is not duly authorized
to handle controlled substances in the state in which he does business. See 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The DEA Administrators
have consistently held that practitioners who lack state authorization to handle controlled substances cannot
be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration. See Ramon Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); George S. Heath,
M.D., 51 FR 26610 (1986); Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., 51 FR 23481 (1986). Consequently, the Administrator concludes that
Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration should be revoked based on lack of state authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him
by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BL2125068, issued
to Michael D. Lawton, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration be, and
they hereby are, denied.

Consolidation Coal Company, P.O. Box 100, Osage, West Virginia 26543 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364 (weekly examination) to its Arkwright No. 1 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01452) located in Monongalia County,
West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to make mine ventilation changes after obtaining District Manager approval
that will make certain check points established by granted petition M&hyph;91&hyph;35&hyph;C unnecessary. The
petitioner states that the mine's 1 South/2 South longwall panel will intersect and utilize certain entries for ventilation
of this panel when production starts. In addition, the petitioner states that the operator will rehabilitate this
short stretch of air course to make it safe to travel prior to start of production, eliminating the need for check points
19A and 19B; that the proposed ventilation changes would result in certain air courses becoming common with the track
entry, which is traveled and examined, eliminating the need for the associated check points. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings will
consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee Meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c) (4) and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

<DOCTITLE>Abnormal Occurrence Report Section, 208 Report Submitted to the Congress</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the requirements of section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as
amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published and issued another periodic report to Congress on
abnormal occurrences (NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 16, No. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which created NRC, an abnormal occurrence is defined as ``an unscheduled
incident or event that the Commission (NRC) determines is significant from the standpoint of public health or safety.''
NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection
against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report to Congress is for the third calendar quarter of 1993. The report identifies the occurrences or events that
the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report discusses two abnormal occurrences at NRC-licensed facilities. One involved a medical sodium iodide
misadministration and one involved a 1981 fatal radiation exposure of a radiographer. One industrial radiographer
overexposure event and four medical misadministrations that were reported by the Agreement States are also discussed,
based on information provided by the Agreement States as of November 1, 1993. The report also contains information
updating four previously reported abnormal occurrences at NRC-licensed facilities and three reported by the Agreement
States, and includes information on two other events of interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D has been added to this report which includes events submitted by Agreement States that are likely to be categorized
as abnormal occurrences. For these events, insufficient information was available as of November 1, 1993, to positively
identify them as abnormal occurrences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.
(Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout the
country.

<DOCTITLE>The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., et al.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating
License and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;58, issued to The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne
Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, and Toledo Edison Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No.1, located in Lake County, Ohio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment, requested by the licensee by letter of December 16, 1993, would represent a full conversion
from the current Technical Specifications (TS) to a set of TS based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR/6 Technical
Specifications,'' Revision O, September 1992. NUREG&hyph;1434 has been developed through working groups composed
of both NRC staff members and the BWR/6 owners and has been endorsed by the staff as part of an industry-wide initiative
to standardize and improve TS. As part of this submittal, the licensee has applied the criteria contained in the Final
NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements to the current Perry Nuclear Power Plant Technical
Specifications utilizing BWR Owners' Group (BWROG) report NEDO&hyph;31466, ``Technical Specification Screening
Criteria Application and Risk Assessment,'' (and Supplement 1) as incorporated in NUREG&hyph;1434.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has categorized the proposed changes into four general groupings. These groupings are characterized
as administrative changes, relocated changes, more restrictive changes, and less restrictive changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative changes are those that involve reformatting, renumbering and rewording of the existing TS. The reformatting,
renumbering and rewording process reflects the attributes of NUREG&hyph;1434 and do not involve technical changes
to the existing TS. Such changes are administrative in nature and do not impact initiators of analyzed events or assumed
mitigation of accident or transient events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relocated changes are those involving relocation of requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components
or variables that do not meet the criteria of inclusion in TS as identified in the Application of Selection Criteria
to the Perry TS. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to be initiators of analyzed
events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and surveillances for these
affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the TS to administratively controlled
documents. Changes made to these documents will be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected structures,
systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are also subject to 10
CFR 50.59 and subject to the change control provision in the Administrative Controls Section of the TS. These proposed
changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More restrictive changes are those involving more stringent requirements for operation of the facility. These more
stringent requirements do not result in operation that will alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident
or transient event. The more restrictive requirements continue to ensure process variables, structures, systems
and components are maintained consistent with the safety analyses and licensing basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes characterized as less restrictive have been subdivided into four additional subcategories. They include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relocating details to TS Bases, the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR), or procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements to be transposed from the TS to the Bases, USAR or procedures are the same as those currently included
in the existing TS. The TS Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information are subject to 10 CFR 50.59
and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of instrumentation surveillance test intervals (STIs) and allowed outage times (AOTs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed changes affect only the STIs and AOTs and will not impact the function of monitoring system variables
over the anticipated ranges for normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences, or accident conditions.
However, the changes are expected to reduce the test related plant scrams and test induced wear on the equipment. General
Electric topical reports GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;1 and GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;2 showed that the effects
of these extensions of STIs and AOTs, which produced negligible impact, are bounded by previous analyses. Further,
the NRC has reviewed these reports and approved the conclusions on a generic basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relocation of instrumentation only requirements (which provide no post-accident function).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These requirements are part of routine operational monitoring and are not considered in the safety analysis. Changes
made to the Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information will be made in accordance with 10 CFR
50.59 and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. These proposed
changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other less restrictive changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Additional changes that result in less restrictions in the TS are discussed individually in the licensee's submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By May 16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714,
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081.
If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel,
will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will
issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendments
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John N. Hannon, Director, Project Directorate III&hyph;3: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Jay E. Silberg, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington,
DC 20037, attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer, or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards considerations in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated December 16, 1993, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Perry Public Library, 3753, Main Street,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;62, issued to Illinois Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Clinton Power Station,
Unit 1, located in Dewitt County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment, requested by the licensee by letter of October 26, 1993, would represent a full conversion
from the current Technical Specifications (TS) to a set of TS based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR/6 Technical
Specifications,'' Revision 0, September 1992. NUREG&hyph;1434 has been developed through working groups composed
of both NRC staff members and the BWR/6 owners and has been endorsed by the staff as part of an industry-wide initiative
to standardize and improve TS. As part of this submittal, the licensee has applied the criteria contained in the Final
NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements to the current Clinton Power Station Technical Specifications
utilizing BWR Owners' Group (BWROG) report NEDO&hyph;31466, ``Technical Specification Screening Criteria Application
and Risk Assessment,'' (and Supplement 1) as incorporated in NUREG&hyph;1434.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has categorized the proposed changes into four general groupings. These groupings are characterized
as administrative changes, relocated changes, more restrictive changes, and less restrictive changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative changes are those that involve reformatting, renumbering and rewording of the existing TS. The reformatting,
renumbering and rewording process reflects the attributes of NUREG&hyph;1434 and do not involve technical changes
to the existing TS. Such changes are administrative in nature and do not impact initiators of analyzed events or assumed
mitigation of accident or transient events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relocated changes are those involving relocation of requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components
or variables that do not meet the criteria of inclusion in TS as identified in the Application of Selection Criteria
to the Clinton Power Station TS. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to be initiators
of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and surveillances
for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the TS to administratively
controlled documents. Changes made to these documents will be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected
structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are also
subject to 10 CFR 50.59 and subject to the change control provision in the Administrative Controls Section of the TS.
These proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More restrictive changes are those involving more stringent requirements for operation of the facility. These more
stringent requirements do not result in operation that will alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident
or transient event. The more restrictive requirements continue to ensure process variables, structures, systems
and components are maintained consistent with the safety analyses and licensing basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes characterized as less restrictive have been subdivided into four additional subcategories. They include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relocating details to TS Bases, the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR), or procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements to be transposed from the TS to the Bases, USAR or procedures are the same as those currently included
in the existing TS. The TS Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information are subject to 10 CFR 50.59
and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of instrumentation surveillance test intervals and allowed outage times.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed changes affect only the STIs and AOTs and will not impact the function of monitoring system variables
over the anticipated ranges for normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences, or accident conditions.
However, the changes are expected to reduce the test related plant scrams and test induced wear on the equipment. General
Electric Topical Reports GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;1 and GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;2 showed that the effects
of these extensions of STIs and AOTs, which produced negligible impact, are bounded by previous analyses. Further,
the NRC has reviewed these reports and approved the conclusions on a generic basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relocation of instrumentation only requirements (which provide no post-accident function). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These requirements are part of routine operational monitoring and are not considered in the safety analysis. Changes
made to the Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information will be made in accordance with 10 CFR
50.59 and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. These proposed
changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other less restrictive changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional changes that result in less restrictions in the TS are discussed individually in the licensee's submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By May 16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714,
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Vespasian Warner Public Libary, 120 West Johnson Street,
Clinton, Illinois 61727. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the
Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference schedule in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendments
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John N. Hannon, Director, Project Directorate III&hyph;3: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Sheldon Zabel, Esq., Schiff, Hardin and Waite, 7200 Sears Tower, 233 Wacker Drive, Chicago,
Illinois 60606, attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer, or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards considerations in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated October 26, 1993, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room, located at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 Johnson

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs
under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Section 4220 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1400) requires the plan sponsor of a multiemployer pension plan covered by Title
IV of ERISA to submit for PBGC review certain plan amendments authorized by ERISA sections 4201 through 4219 (29 U.S.C.
1381&hyph;1399). These amendments deal with modification of the statutory provisions regarding when a withdrawal
from a multiemployer plan occurs and how the withdrawing employer's withdrawal liability is determined. Any such
amendment is effective only if the PBGC approves it or, within 90 days after receiving notice and a copy of the amendment,
fails to disapprove it. The PBGC may disapprove an amendment only if it determines that the amendment creates an unreasonable
risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the PBGC.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 2677 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR part 2677), Procedures for PBGC Approval of Plan Amendments, includes,
in &sect;2677.2, rules for plan sponsor requests for agency approval of multiemployer plan amendments. Paragraph
(d) of &sect;2677.2 requires the submission of information that the PBGC needs to identify a plan and evaluate the
risk of loss, if any, posed by the amendment (and, hence, determine whether it should disapprove the amendment). The
regulation also permits submission of other information the plan sponsor believes to be pertinent to its requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC is requesting that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval of this collection of information
(OMB control number 1212&hyph;0031; expires May 31, 1994) for another three years. The agency estimates that it will
receive three requests annually and that each request will take two hours to prepare, for a total annual burden of six
hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice advises interested persons that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has received a request from
the San Francisco Baseball Associates, L.P. for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to the Major League Baseball Players
Benefit Plan. Section 4204(a)(1) provides that the sale of assets by an employer that contributes to a multiemployer
pension plan will not constitute a complete or partial withdrawal from the plan if certain conditions are met. One
of these conditions is that the purchaser post a bond or deposit money in escrow for the five-plan-year period beginning
after the sale. The PBGC is authorized to grant individual and class exemptions from this requirement. Before granting
an exemption the PBGC is required to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the exemption request. The
purpose of this notice is to advise interested persons of the exemption request and solicit their views on it.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4204 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980 (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), provides that a bona fide arm's-length sale of assets of a contributing
employer to an unrelated party will not be considered a withdrawal if three conditions are met. These conditions,
enumerated in section 4204(a)(1)(A)&hyph;(C), are that_

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the
same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, in an amount
equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding
the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year
in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in
which the sale occurred); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning
after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability
it (the seller) would have had but for section 4204.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make
any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes
by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding
four plan years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or
class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted.
The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sales rules be administered in
a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions.

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;S. 1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16
(Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980). The granting of an exemption or variance from the
bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC that a particular transaction satisfies the other
requirements of section 4204(a)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of
the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (&sect;&sect;2643.12&hyph;2643.14)
is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction
of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction
of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.
552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance or exemption if it determines
that approval of the request is warranted, in that it_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4204(c) of ERISA and &sect;2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency
of a request for a variance or exemption in the

The Request
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC has received a request from the San Francisco Baseball Associates, L.P. (the ``Buyer'') for an exemption
from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of the San Francisco Giants
(the ``Seller'') on November 20, 1992. In the request, the Buyer represents among other things that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective
bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League Baseball Players Association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Seller was a participating employer in the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major
League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating
employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating
employer in satisfaction of the employer's pension liability under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the
Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues
from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio
and television revenues, including revenues from foreign broadcasts, of regular and exhibition games.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. During the 1992 Plan year, approximately $34.1 million was paid into the Plan on behalf of all major league clubs.
In that year revenues to the Central Fund exceeded expenses, including contributions to the Plan, by approximately
$354 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The amount of the bond/escrow required under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA is $1,412,077, and the estimated amount
of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for section 4204 is $4,796,483.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The contract of sale between the Buyer and the Seller was effective November 20, 1992, and the final closing occurred
on January 14, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The contract of sale provides that the Buyer agrees ``to contribute to the Plan substantially the same number of
contribution base units which the Seller had an obligation to contribute to the Plan.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The contract of sale further provides that ``[i]f the Buyer thereafter, but prior to the end of the fifth plan year
commencing after the closing, partially or completely withdraws from the Plan, the Seller will be secondarily liable
for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the Plan *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In support of the waiver request, the requestor asserts that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``[B]ecause the Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's]
Trust without first passing through the hands of any of the Employers, the Plan enjoys adequate security *&blank;*&blank;*.
A change in ownership of an Employer does not in any way affect the obligation to fund the Plan *&blank;*&blank;* nor
create the possibility that there will be difficulty in collecting Plan contributions due from any new owner *&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. A complete copy of the non-confidential portions of the request has been sent to the Plan and the Union by certified
mail, return receipt requested.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 8, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange is proposing to list and trade cash-settled, European-style options on the CBOE Real Estate Investment
Trust Index (``REIT Index'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the CBOE, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enable the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style options
on an industry index, the CBOE REIT Index, in accordance with CBOE Rule 24.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT Index will reflect a segment of the U.S. equity securities market that currently is not represented in the
derivatives markets and, as such, will offer investors a low-cost means to achieve diversification or to tilt a portfolio
toward, or away from, real estate investments. The REIT Index will provide retail and institutional investors with
a means to benefit from forecasts about the financial performance of real estate investment trusts (``REITs'') and
their underlying real estate assets. Options on the index also may be used by portfolio managers and investors to provide
a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively or actively managed REITs, and may serve as a means of hedging
the risks of investing in real estate generally, and REIT stocks in particular.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT Index is based on twenty-five REIT stocks. Twenty-three of those stocks currently trade on the New York Stock
Exchange, and two currently trade on the American Stock Exchange. The REIT Index is price-weighted and will be calculated
on a real-time basis using last-sale prices of the securities underlying the index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT Index is composed of stocks that ranged in market capitalization from $220.2 million to $1.1 billion as of
February 14, 1994. The median capitalization as of that date was $518.7 million. The stock with the largest weight
in the index accounted for 6.5 percent of the total weighting, while the smallest weighted stock accounted for 1.1
percent. Four of the component stocks are currently the subject of trading in equity options, and the balance of the
component stocks meet the criteria for listing as equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3. All component stocks are ``reported
securities'' under Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT Index will be calculated continuously by the CBOE or its designee, and the index value will be disseminated
by the CBOE every 15 seconds. If a component stock currently is not being traded, the most recently traded price will
be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case with other industry indices that have been approved for trading on the Exchange, the REIT Index is price-weighted,
reflecting changes in the prices of the component stocks in relation to the base date of the index, January 3, 1994.
The REIT Index is calculated by summing the prices of the component stocks and then dividing by a divisor that yielded
an index value of 200.00 as of the base date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT Index will be maintained by the CBOE. To assure continuity in the index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
removal and replacement of one component stock, component stock splits, and financial restructuring of a component
REIT.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REIT Index will be reviewed approximately on a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The CBOE may change the composition
of the REIT Index at any time to reflect conditions in REIT markets. At present, all twenty-five REITs represented
in the index invest a preponderance of their assets (in most cases, at least 75 percent) in real property. If a REIT that
is included as a component stock becomes unrepresentative of REIT markets, the stock will be removed from the index.
Whenever removal is necessary, every effort will be made to replace the removed stock with a stock that is suitably
representative. In such circumstances, the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility,
and name recognition of the proposed replacement stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE most likely will maintain twenty-five stocks in the index at all times. Absent prior approval by the Commission,
the CBOE will not increase to more then thirty-three nor reduce to fewer than seventeen the number of stocks in the REIT
Index, nor will it make any change in the composition of the index that would cause less than ninety percent of the REIT
Index, by weight, to be composed of stocks that are eligible for listing as equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the REIT Index on the full value of the index. The Exchange may list
long-term index option series (``LEAPS''), as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9. The Exchange also may provide for the listing
of reduced-value LEAPS, the underlying value of which will be calculated at one-tenth the REIT Index value. The current
and closing index value of any such reduced-value LEAPS, after the initial computation, will be rounded to the nearest
one-hundredth. Strike price intervals will be no less than $5.00 for every series of REIT Index options, except that
reduced-value LEAPS will have stock price intervals that are no less than $2.50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REIT Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning
of the rules in Chapter XXIV, including CBOE Rule 24.9, which is being amended to refer specifically to REIT Index options.
The proposed options will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last
day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As modified in this proposed rule change, the Rules in Chapter XXIV will be applicable to REIT Index options. The REIT
Index will be deemed to be ``narrow-based'' for purposes of the position limit requirements of CBOE Rule 24.4A. Ten
reduced-value options will equal one full-value contract for position limit purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE has the necessary systems capacity to support new series of options that would result from the introduction
of REIT Index options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to enable the listing and trading of REIT Index
options subject to just and equitable principles of trade and is structured to protect investors and the public interest.

Letter from Jean M. Cawley, OCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Esq. Chief, Branch of Clearing Agency Regulation, Division
of Market Regulation, Commission (March 8, 1993). The amendment modified Article VIII, section 6 of OCC's By-Laws
to clarify that in the event a clearing member seeks to withdraw from membership at the time of an additional assessment
to the clearing funds and such clearing member's computed contribution is less than its minimum required contribution,
the clearing member will be obligated to contribute 100% of the amount equal to its minimum contribution less its computed
contribution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this rule change is to revise the formula by which OCC assesses its clearing funds for losses incurred
as a result of a default by a clearing member and for losses resulting from the failure of any bank or securities or commodities
clearing organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC maintains a stock clearing fund to which OCC's stock clearing members are required to contribute and a non-equity
securities clearing fund to which non-equity security clearing members are required to contribute. Among other
things, the purpose of the clearing funds is to make good any losses sustained by OCC as a result of the failure of a clearing
member to meet its obligations to OCC or the failure of a clearing bank or another clearing organization to settle with
OCC. Currently in the event of a clearing member default, once the contributions of the defaulting clearing member
are exhausted, OCC will charge on a pro rata basis the clearing fund contributions of non-defaulting clearing members
for any remaining losses. Similarly, in the event of a clearing bank or clearing organization default, the resulting
loss is to be charged against all clearing members' contributions to the clearing funds on a pro rata basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless a clearing member has been recently admitted, a clearing member's contribution to the clearing funds is determined
pursuant to the formula set forth in OCC Rule 1001. A clearing member's contribution to the clearing funds is related
to the clearing member's use of the options markets provided, however, that each clearing member must contribute
at least the required minimum. Pursuant to Rule 1001, each stock clearing member or non-equity securities clearing
member must contribute to the stock clearing fund or the non-equity securities clearing fund, respectively, the
greater of: (i) Such clearing member's proportionate share (``computed contribution'') of five percent of its average
daily aggregate margin requirement in respect of equity or non-equity securities option contracts outstanding
during the previous calendar month or (ii) the required minimum contribution amount of $75,000. Because this contribution
formula is based on a clearing member's open interests and margin requirements, it provides a reasonable approximation
of a clearing member's participation in the options markets and use of OCC's services. Therefore, it is highly probable
that a clearing member who deposits the required minimum to the clearing funds is less active in the options markets
in ways that give rise to potential OCC financial exposure than a clearing member whose clearing fund contribution
is its computed contribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current assessment formula, non-defaulting clearing members are charged on a pro rata basis against their
required contributions, whether computed or the minimum. OCC believes that it is more equitable to base its assessment
formula on a clearing member's participation in the options markets and use of OCC's services rather than on a minimum
contribution requirement. Therefore, OCC is proposing that charges to clearing fund contributions be made on a proportionate
basis against non-defaulting clearing members' computed contributions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OCC is amending section 5 of Article VIII of its By-Laws to provide that any losses remaining after use
of a defaulting clearing member's assets or as the result of a failure of a clearing bank or another clearing organization
will be charged on a proportionate basis against non-defaulting clearing members' computed contributions. Section
5 is further amended to add three Interpretations and Policies. The Interpretations and Policies set forth the manner
by which a clearing member's proportionate share of a remaining loss will be determined. As a result of these rule changes,
OCC believes that the assessment formula is based upon a clearing member's use of the options markets and use of OCC's
services and is more equitable to those clearing members which use the options markets with less frequency.

Conforming changes are made to sections 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), 5(d), 5(e), and 5(h), 6, 7, and 8 of Article VIII of OCC's By-Laws
and to Rule 1106(e). A technical amendment to Section 5(h) also is made to correctly identify paragraph (b), in the
place of paragraph (d), as a paragraph pertaining to certain applications of clearing fund contributions. A technical
amendment also is made to Section 1 of Article VIII to identify correctly Chapter XI in place of Chapter VI as the Chapter
of OCC's Rules where OCC's protective transaction provisions may be found.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirements of section 17A of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation
of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among participants.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change provides a more equitable formula by which OCC may assess the clearing fund contributions
of clearing members. Under the previous formula, clearing members depositing the minimum $75,000 clearing fund
requirement were subject to proportionately greater assessments than clearing members whose clearing fund requirements
were based on their computed contributions because the assessments were based upon a pro rata charge of required clearing
fund contributions. By basing clearing fund assessments on a proportionate basis against the computed contributions
of all clearing members, even those who have deposited the minimum requirement, the assessments will be linked more
closely to the open interests and market activities of clearing members.

Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency assure the safeguarding of securities and funds
which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed amendments will not affect the total size of the clearing funds. It is possible that as a result of the new
assessment formula more than one round of charges to the clearing fund contributions of clearing members could be
required to assess all of a clearing member's minimum contribution. However, OCC has provided in Article VIII, section
6 of its Bylaws that should a clearing member seek to withdraw from OCC membership, any portion of that clearing member's
clearing funds that are unavailable for the first charge will be available to OCC in a second assessment.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 20, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to allow the Exchange to list capped-style stock index options (``capped options'').
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Initially, the Exchange proposes to list capped options on the Wilshire Small Cap Index and the PSE Technology Index
(together, the ``Indexes'').

On October 20, 1993, the PSE amended its proposal to replace references to ``CAPS'' with references to ``capped-style''
options and to state that the Exchange plans initially to adopt a cap interval of 20 points. See Letter from Michael
D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division
of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated October 15, 1993 (``Amendment No. 1''). On November 3, 1993,
the PSE amended its proposal to indicate that the proposal will apply only to broad-based domestic index options and
to clarify that Bridge Data Company calculates the opening and closing index values for the Wilshire Small Cap Index
and the PSE Technology Index. See Letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Yvonne
Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division, Commission, dated October 29, 1993 (``Amendment No. 2'').
On February 7, 1994, the PSE amended its proposal to include new Rule 7.8(c), which will (1) indicate those indexes
that have been approved by the PSE for capped option trading; (2) provide, in rule form, that, unless modified by the
PSE, the cap interval will be $20.00; and (3) set forth the standards for listing and adding series of capped options.
See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Michael A. Walinskas, Staff Attorney,
Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated February 7, 1994 (``Amendment
No. 3''). On April 5, 1994, the PSE amended the proposal to indicate that the PSE has developed procedures to identify
and correct any exercise settlement values prior to clearance and settlement of such contracts at the Options Clearing
Corporation. See letter from Michael D. Pierson, Senior Attorney, PSE, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division
of Market Regulation, SEC, dated April 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 4).

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed PSE Rule 7.1(r) defines a ``capped-style index option'' as an index option that is exercised automatically
prior to expiration when the cap price is less than or equal to the closing index value for calls or when the cap price
is greater than or equal to the closing index value for puts. The cap price, which is assigned by the Exchange when the
capped option is listed, is the exercise price plus the cap interval for a call or the exercise price minus the cap interval
for a put. Accordingly, the cap price is above the exercise price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 strike price) for calls and below the exercise price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 strike price) for puts. The difference between the strike price and the cap price is equal to the ``cap interval.''
Specifically, the PSE defines the cap interval as a ``value specified by the Exchange which, when added to the exercise
price for the series (in the case of a series of calls) or subtracted from the exercise price for such series (in the case
of a series of puts), results in the cap price for the series.'' The PSE has set as an initial standard, subject to Exchange
modification that the cap interval for capped options must be $20.00.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While capped options will be subject to automatic exercise due to movements in the underlying index, they also will
be European-style, so that if the cap price is not reached prior to expiration the option can be exercised by the holder
only at expiration pursuant to the rules of the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''). Thus, if the underlying index
fails to reach the cap price during the life of the capped option, the option becomes European-style on the last business
day before expiration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon automatic exercise of a capped option, the holder receives a cash settlement amount equal to the cap interval
times the multiplier for the option. Under no circumstances, however, does the holder receive a cash settlement amount
greater than the cap interval times the index multiplier. Therefore, the cap price establishes a maximum pre-defined
value for the capped options. For example, if the index multiplier is 100, the index closes at 382 and the investor holds
a capped call option with a strike price of 360 and a cap interval of 20, then the holder would receive a cash settlement
amount equal to $2,000 (20 times $100).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Long capped call options closely resemble vertical bull spreads traded as a single security (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the combination of one long and one short call position with the same expiration but where the strike price of the short
call is higher than the strike price of the long call). Conversely, long capped put options closely resemble vertical
bear spreads traded as a single security (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the combination of one long put and one short put position with the same expiration, but where the strike price of the
short put is lower than the strike price of the long put).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PSE has proposed the following rule changes to accommodate the trading of capped index options. First, the PSE
plans to amend Exchange Rule 7.1, ``Definitions,'' to define ``capped-style option,'' ``capped-style index option.''
``cap interval,'' and ``cap price.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 7.6, ``Position Limits,'' to provide that capped options will
be aggregated with standard index option contracts on the same stock index for position limit purposes. However,
the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 7.7, ``Exercise Limits,'' to provide that capped options will not be
aggregated with standard option contracts on the same stock index when calculating exercise limits. This amendment
is designed to avoid instances where an investor would violate exercise limits by virtue of the automatic exercise
of the capped options, an event over which the investor has no control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 7.8, ``Terms of Options Contracts,'' to: (1) Indicate those indexes upon
which capped options can be traded; (2) reflect that the cap interval for capped options, unless modified by the Exchange,
shall be $20.00; (3) provide that initially, one at-the-money capped option call and put will be listed with an expiration
of up to one year in the future and additional at-the-money capped option series may be listed every two months with
expirations up to one year in the future; and (4) capped option series may be added to expiration months with three or
more months remaining to their expiration, if there has been a move of ten or more points in the index value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the Exchange proposes to amend Exchange Rule 7.16, ``Margin,'' to provide the following margin treatment
for short positions in capped options. For cash accounts, the customer must deposit an amount equal to the cap interval
times the index multiplier in cash or cash equivalents as defined in Section 220.8(a)(3) of Regulation T under the
Act. For margin accounts, the margin requirement is 100% of the current market value of the contract plus 15% of the
current index value times the index multiplier. In each case, the amount shall be decreased by any excess of the aggregate
exercise price of the option over the current index value as multiplied by the index multiplier in the case of a call,
or any excess of the current index value as multiplied by the index multiplier over the aggregate exercise price of
the option in the case of a put; provided, however, that the minimum margin required on each contract shall not be less
than (a) the option market value plus 10% of the current index value multiplied by the index multiplier or (b) the cap
interval multiplied by the index multiplier, whichever is less. The maximum margin required on each contract shall
not exceed the cap interval multiplied by the index multiplier.

III. Commission Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5),
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and, therefore, approves the Exchange's proposal.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the capped options are an innovative financial product that will provide
investors with additional choice and flexibility in their use of derivatives. In addition, capped options offer
both holders and writers of options a means to participate in the options markets at a predetermined maximum gain or
loss. Under the terms of the capped options, the option writer's (holder's) maximum loss (gain) is established at
the time of the investment by the option's cap interval. Once the option's cap price (the strike price plus the cap interval
for a call or the strike price minus the cap interval for a put) has been reached, the option is exercised automatically.
The option writer's maximum potential liability is the amount of the cap interval, and, conversely, the option holder's
maximum gain is the amount of the cap interval. Thus, capped options permit investors to participate in the options
market at a known and limited cost. By limiting some of the risks associated with spread positions in American-style
and European-style options, capped options likely will make the options markets more attractive to a broad range
of investors. In addition, the Commission notes that capped options, which are the equivalent of vertical bull and
bear spreads traded as a single security, likely will benefit investors by providing them with a more efficient and
cost-effective method of executing spread transactions.

The PSE proposal is nearly identical to separate proposals to list and trade capped-style index options submitted
by the CBOE and Amex and subsequently approved by the Commission. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29865,
56 FR 56255 (November 1, 1991) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;91&hyph;24) and 29934, 56 FR 58593 (November

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also finds that the specific rules proposed by the PSE to accommodate capped options are consistent
with the Act.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to set a cap interval of $20.00 in that the
cap price is placed sufficiently far from the exercise price so that the capped options will not be exercised automatically
on a frequent basis.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that PSE Rule 7.1(q) defines capped-style options and PSE 7.1(r) defines capped-style index
options. Because the current Exchange proposal, as the Commission's approval order herein, is limited to capped
options on the Wilshire Small Cap Index and the PSE Technology Index, should the PSE decide to list capped-style options
on other indexes, including a foreign broad-based stock index, a narrow-based stock index, or an individual security,
then the Commission believes an Exchange rule filing made pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act would be necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that a rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act would be necessary if the PSE decided to
change the present cap interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to bring up new at-the-money series of capped options
every other month and after significant market moves is consistent with the Act because it will not result in a proliferation
of options series. The Commission also finds that it is consistent with the Act to exclude capped options from exercise
limit calculations because holders of capped options have no control over when their positions will be exercised,
except on the last business day before expiration of the options. Moreover, the Commission notes that capped options
are not excluded from position limit calculations, in that capped options are aggregated with non-capped-style
index options for position limit purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission believes that the proposed margin treatment for capped options in cash and margin accounts
is consistent with the Act. Specifically, the Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act to permit short
capped options positions in a cash account so long as the maximum exposure (the difference between the exercise price
and the cap price times the index multiplier) is deposited. This position is the equivalent of a completely covered
position, because the maximum risk of loss is already on deposit. In addition, the Commission believes the proposed
margin requirements for capped options positions maintained in margin accounts are consistent with the Act because
they are virtually identical to the margin requirements for short stock index options positions in non-capped style
stock index options held in margin accounts, except for the fact that a limit equal to the maximum exposure to the option
writer is placed on the margin requirement. It is reasonable to limit the margin in this fashion because, if the limit
is invoked, the margin covers 100% of the exposure to the writer and no additional margin calls need be made.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the Commission believes that the automatic exercise feature of capped options necessitates that, when the
PSR lists capped options on a specific index, the PSE ensures that the exercise settlement value for the index is accurate
at all times. An erroneous exercise settlement value could conceivably result in the unwarranted automatic exercise
of capped options and the irreversible elimination of an options position. Accordingly, in this regard, the Commission
notes that the PSE has developed procedures to identify and correct any exercise settlement values prior to settlement
of such contracts at OCC.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the PSE's proposal to list capped options prior to the thirtieth day

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because the Exchange's proposal is substantially the same as the formerly submitted and approved CBOE and Amex proposals
to list and trade capped options.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission received no adverse comments on the CBOE or Amex proposals during the 21-day comment period. The Commission
also does not find any different regulatory issues arising from the PSE's proposal. Thus, the Commission believes
it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis in order to facilitate competition between
the exchanges for product services, which, in turn, should benefit public investors. The Commission believes, therefore,
that good cause exists for approving the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Air Express International
Corporation, Common Stock, $.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;8306</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
April 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air Express International Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule
12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration
on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved a resolution on September
10, 1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than continuing the present listing
on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before April 29, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Application To Strike From Listing and Registration; The Chicago
Stock Exchange, Inc. (Circle Fine Art Corporation, Common Stock, $.10 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;8653</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
April 8, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Exchange'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(c) promulgated
thereunder to strike the above specified security from listing and registration thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged for striking this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Exchange, Article XXVIII, Rule 7, states that, an issue will be considered for delisting when the
volume of trading declines to a level which will not support a listed market in the judgment of the Exchange and its Committee
on Floor Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Exchange, there has been no trading volume since 1990 for the Circle Fine Art Corporation on the Chicago
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Exchange, Article XXVIII, Rule 7 Paragraph 1 states, that the applicant shall agree to notify the
Exchange promptly of any changes in the general character or nature of its business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Exchange, the Company did not send a 10&hyph;K to the Exchange until it responded to a third request
from the Exchange. The Company had been delinquent in sending current filings to the Exchange. In the interim, there
were changes in the nature of the Company's general structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, having considered the facts stated in the application and having due regard for the public interest
and protection of investors, orders that said application be, and it hereby is, granted, effective at the opening
of business on April 11, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company originally incorporated under Massachusetts law and redomiciled
in Connecticut. On June 2, 1986, the board of directors of Hartford Life established the Account. The Account serves
as the funding medium for the Contracts and consists of several subaccounts (the ``Subaccounts''), each of which
invests in certain underlying registered investment companies.

In December of 1993, a registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 was filed with the Commission to register the Contracts.
As of the date of this notice, the registration statement had not yet been declared effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. HESCO, the principal underwriter for the Contracts, is registered with the Commission as a broker dealer under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Owners of the Contracts may allocate purchase payments to one or more of the Subaccounts, to the fixed account (the
``Fixed Account'') which is part of the general account of Hartford Life, or to a combination of the Subaccounts and
the Fixed Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A Contract owner may select an annuity option on either a fixed or variable basis and may select one of four annuity
options: Life annuity; life annuity with 120, 180 or 240 monthly payments certain; joint and last survivor annuity;
and payments for a designated period. Each annuity option provides for a series of annuity payments beginning on the
annuity commencement date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If upon death, prior to the annuity commencement date, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as applicable, had not
attained his or her 90th birthday, the beneficiary of the Contract will receive the greatest of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Contract value determined as of the day written proof of death of such person is received by Hartford Life;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 100% of the total purchase payments made to such Contract; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The maximum anniversary value
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 increased by the dollar amount of any purchase payments made and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial surrenders
(commonly referred to as a ``stepped up'' death benefit). If the deceased, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as
applicable, had attained age 90, the death benefit will equal the Contract value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The maximum anniversary value is equal to the greatest anniversary value attained as follows. The anniversary value
is equal to the Contract value on a Contract anniversary (anniversary of the effective date of the Contract), increased
by the dollar amount of any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial
surrenders since that anniversary. As of the date of death, Hartford Life will calculate an anniversary value for
each Contract anniversary prior to the deceased's attained age 81.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') may be assessed against Contract values upon surrender.
The length of time from receipt of a premium payment to the time of surrender determines the Sales Charge. Purchase
payments will be deemed to be surrendered in the order in which they are received and all surrenders will be deemed made
first from purchase payments and then from other Contract values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Sales Charge is 6% the first and second years, 5% the third and fourth years, 4% the fifth year, 3% the sixth year,
2% the seventh year, and 0% the eighth year. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract
owner may make a partial surrender of Contract values up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract
(as determined on the date of the requested withdrawal) without application of the Sales Charge. After the seventh
Contract year, the Contract owner may make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during
the seven years prior to the surrender, or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven
years prior to the surrender, without the application of a Sales Charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Hartford Life will deduct an annual maintenance fee of $30 from each Contract to reimburse Hartford Life for expenses
relating to administration and maintenance of the Contract and the Subaccounts. There is no charge for Contracts
with more than a $50,000 Contract value on the Contract anniversary. The application states that the annual maintenance
fee may not be increased during the life of the Contracts. Applicants further state that total revenues from the annual
maintenance fees under the Contracts are not expected to exceed Hartford Life's average expected costs for administering
the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Hartford Life will deduct a daily charge at the rate of 1.25% annually to compensate it for providing mortality and
expense guarantees with respect to the Contracts. Applicants estimate that 0.90% of the 1.25% charge is for mortality
risk and 0.35% is for expense risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants state that the mortality risk arises from the obligation of Hartford Life to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Make monthly annuity payments, regardless of how long an annuitant may live and regardless of how long annuitants
as a group may live; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Pay the minimum death benefit under a Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Hartford Life is the risk that the administrative fees assessed
by Hartford Life will be insufficient to cover actual expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge will not increase. If the charge is insufficient
to cover actual costs, the loss will fall on Hartford Life. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient to
meet actual expenses, the excess will be profit to Hartford Life and will be available for any proper corporate purpose.
Applicants state that Hartford Life expects a reasonable profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent relief is necessary
to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor
thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments
(other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which
prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts
as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally
performed by the bank itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Hartford Life under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable
variable annuity contracts. Applicants state that this representation is based upon a survey of comparable contracts
issued by a large number of other insurance companies. The application states that Hartford Life will undertake to
maintain and make available to the Commission upon request a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology and
the contracts of other insurance companies underlying this representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants represent that Hartford Life has concluded that there is the likelihood that the proceeds from sales
loads will be insufficient to cover the expected costs of distributing the contracts. Applicants state that any shortfall
will be covered from the assets of the general account, which may include profit from the mortality and expense risk
charge. Hartford Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Account's distribution financing
arrangement will benefit the Account and Contract owners. Applicants further state that Hartford Life undertakes
to maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants represent that the Account will invest only in open-end management companies which have undertaken
to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the open-end management company, formulate
and approve any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (IBP, Inc., Common Stock, $.05
Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;6085</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
April 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IBP, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Exchange, the Company is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and the
Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. IBP would like to delist from the PSE based on the low volume of trading and the costs associated
with the PSE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the Company's total stock traded on the NYSE and PSE for 1993, only 1.3% of the trading occurred on the PSE. The Company
has also determined that each trade on the PSE costs IBP about double the cost of a trade completed on the NYSE. Based
on these figures, IBP has determined it should delist from the PSE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before April 29, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the Application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. ITT Hartford, formerly ITT Insurance Corporation, is a stock life insurance company domiciled in Wisconsin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On May 20, 1991, the Board of Directors of Hartford Life established the Separate Account. The Separate Account
issues only flexible premium tax deferred variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account consists of several
subaccounts (the ``Subaccounts''), each of which invests in certain underlying registered investment companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In December 1993, the Separate Account filed a Form N&hyph;4 to register interests of a new flexible premium contract
to be funded by the Separate Account (the ``New Contract'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. HESCO will serve as the principal underwriter for the Contracts (including the New Contract). HESCO is registered
with the Commission as a broker dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Contract owners may allocate purchase payments to any one or more of the Subaccounts, to the fixed account (the ``Fixed
Account'') which is part of the general account of ITT Hartford, or to a combination of the Subaccounts and the Fixed
Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A Contract owner may select one of four annuity options: life annuity; life annuity with 120, 180 or 240 monthly payments;
joint and last survivor annuity; and payments for a designated period. Each annuity option provides for a series of
annuity payments commencing on the annuity commencement date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If upon death, prior to the annuity commencement date, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as applicable, had not
attained his or her 90th birthday, the beneficiary of the Contract will receive the greatest of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Contract value determined as of the day written proof of death of such person is received by ITT Hartford;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 100% of the total purchase payments made to such Contract; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The maximum anniversary value
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 increased by the dollar amount of any purchase payments made and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial surrenders
(commonly referred to as a ``stepped up'' death benefit). If the deceased, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as
applicable, has attained age 90, the death benefit will equal the Contract value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The maximum anniversary value is equal to the greatest anniversary value attained as follows. The anniversary value
is equal to the Contract value on a Contract anniversary (anniversary of the effective date of the Contract), increased
by the dollar amount of any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial
surrenders since that anniversary. As of the date of death, Hartford Life will calculate anniversary value for each
Contract anniversary prior to the decedent's 81st birthday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Contract Owners will not pay a sales charge at the time of purchase. However, a contingent deferred sales charge
(``CDSC'') may be assessed against Contract values when they are surrendered. The length of time from receipt of a
premium payment to the time of surrender determines the contingent deferred sales charge. Purchase payments will
be deemed to be surrendered in the order in which they are received and all surrenders will be first from purchase payments
and then from other Contract values. The CDSC equals 6% the first year, 6% the second year, 5% the third year, 5% the fourth
year, 4% the fifth year and 3% the sixth year, and 2% the seventh year, and 0% the eighth year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract owner may make a partial surrender
of Contract values of up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract (as determined on the date of the
requested withdrawal) without the application of the CDSC. After the seventh Contract year, the Contract owner may
make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender,
or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender, without
the application of a CDSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. ITT Hartford will deduct from Contract value each year a daily administrative charge at the rate of .15% per annum.
In addition, for Contracts with Contract value less than $50,000, ITT Hartford will deduct from Contract value each
year, on the Contract anniversary, a maintenance fee of $30. The annual maintenance fee is designed to reimburse ITT
Hartford for expenses relating to the administration and maintenance of a Contract and the Subaccounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Applicants represent that neither the annual maintenance charge nor the administrative charge may be increased
during the life of the Contracts. Moreover, Applicants do not expect the annual maintenance and administrative charges
to exceed ITT Hartford's average expected costs of administering the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. ITT Hartford will deduct a daily charge at the rate of 1.25% per annum to compensate it for providing mortality and
expense guarantees with respect to the Contracts. (The Applicants estimate that of the 1.25% charge, 0.90% is for
mortality risk and 0.35% is for expense risk.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. The mortality risk arises, in large part, from ITT Hartford's obligation:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To make monthly annuity payments, regardless of how long an annuitant may live, and regardless of how long annuitants
as a group may live; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To pay the minimum death benefit under a Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The expense risk is that administrative fees assessed by ITT Hartford will fail to meet the actual expenses incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge will not increase. If the charge is insufficient
to cover actual costs, the loss will fall on ITT Hartford. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient to
meet actual experience, the excess will be a profit to ITT Hartford and will become part of its general account surplus.
ITT Hartford expects to realize a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent relief
is necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account
which serves as a funding medium for the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor
thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment certificates unless the proceeds of all payments
(other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which
prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts
as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by ITT Hartford under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for
comparable variable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon Hartford Life's survey of comparable
contracts issued by a large number of other insurance companies. Hartford Life will undertake to maintain and make
available to the Commission upon request a memorandum outlining the methodology underlying this representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Applicants represent that it is likely that the proceeds from sales loads will be insufficient to cover the expected
costs of distributing the contracts. Any shortfall will be covered from the assets of the general account, which may
include profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Therefore, ITT Hartford has concluded that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the Separate Account's distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Separate Account and
Contract owners, and that it will maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum setting
forth the basis for this representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Applicants represent that the Separate Account will invest only in open-end management companies which, if
they should adopt any distribution financing plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, will have a board of directors,
a majority of whom are not interested persons of the open-end management company. Such board of directors must formulate
and approve any such distribution plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicants assert that for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards in section
6(c) of the 1940 Act. The Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions
of the 1940 Act.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Company is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Pennsylvania in 1977 and redomesticated
under the laws of Michigan on December 9, 1992. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Manufacturers Life
Insurance Company, a mutual life insurance company based in Toronto, Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Separate Account is a separate account of the Company established under the laws of Pennsylvania for the purpose
of funding variable annuity policies. Since December 9, 1992, it has operated under the laws of Michigan. Assets of
the Separate Account will be invested in shares of Manulife Series Fund, Inc. ManEquity, Inc. an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, will be the principal underwriter of the variable annuity
contracts funded through the Separate Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contracts are individual annuity contracts designed for use in connection with plans which are entitled to
special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and under plans or trusts not entitled to any special
tax treatment. They provide for the accumulation of values on a fixed, variable or fixed and variable basis and for
the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed basis only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts provide for the deduction of a record-keeping charge equal to 2% of the contract value up to a maximum
of $30 per year. The charge will be deducted from the guaranteed interest account, the fixed account and the Separate
Account in the same proportion that the value in each bears to the Contract value. The Company will also deduct an administrative
charge of .20% per year from the value of the Contractowner's assets allocated to the Separate Account. The Contracts
permit one free transfer per month of assets among the sub-accounts of the Separate Account and one additional transfer
per month subject to a $35 charge. There is a $5 charge per transfer or series of transfers occurring on any one transfer
date under a dollar cost averaging program if the Contract value is under $15,000. A $15 charge is assessed for each
transfer or series of transfers on one date if the contractowner chooses to participate in an asset allocation balance
program. The Company also reserves the right to impose an administrative charge not to exceed $150 for a partial withdrawal
or full surrender under a special policy access provision that allows a terminally ill Contractowner to make one such
withdrawal or surrender without application of any withdrawal charges. The Applicants state that they propose to
rely on Rules 26a&hyph;1 and 6c&hyph;8(c) under the 1940 Act to permit the imposition of these charges. The Company
does not expect to recover from any of these charges any amount in excess of its accumulated expenses in connection
with the administrative activities for which the charge is made. The Contracts also provide for the deduction of any
premium taxes or similar state or local tax attributable to a Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. No sales charge will be deducted from purchase payments as they are made. Instead, a withdrawal charge will be assessed
on amounts surrendered or withdrawn during a Contract year which exceed 10% of the Contract value as of the most recent
Contract anniversary. Those amounts will be deemed to be purchase payments. The withdrawal charge will be based upon
when the purchase payments to which such amounts are deemed attributable were made. The charge begins at 8% of purchase
payments withdrawn. When three complete Contract years have elapsed since a purchase payment was made, the charge
is reduced to 6% of that purchase payment and it declines 2% per year thereafter. The oldest previously unliquidated
purchase payment will be deemed to have been liquidated first, then the next oldest and so forth. In no event will the
sum of the withdrawal charges exceed 8% of the total purchase payments made.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. The Company proposes to deduct a mortality and expense risks charge (1) daily, from the assets of the Separate Account,
at an annual rate of .80% and (2) monthly, from the Contract value in the Separate Account and the Fixed Account at an
annual rate of .45%. The Company estimates that approximately .85% of each charge is attributable to the mortality
risks assumed by the Company in connection with the Contracts and .40% is attributable to the expense risks. According
to the Applicants, the mortality risks assumed are the risks that (i) annuitants may live for longer periods of time
than the periods indicated in the mortality tables on which the Company calculated the annuity tables in the Contracts,
(ii) mortality will cause a Contract to terminate prematurely before the assumed annuitization date and (iii) the
risk that mortality will cause the Company to incur higher costs than anticipated for certain benefits payable on
the death of the Contractowner. The expense risks assumed are that expenses in administering the Contracts will be
greater than the Company estimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Company is aware that deducting a portion of the mortality and expense risks charge monthly instead of daily
is slightly different from typical industry practice. To assure that the less frequent deduction of the 0.45% portion
of the mortality and expense risks charge does not result in that charge being effectively larger for Contractowners
than a solely daily charge at an annual rate of 1.25%, the 0.45% charge will be administered as a 0.449928% charge. As
a result, the overall effective rate would be 1.24225%, as compared to an effective rate of 1.24226% if the charge were
deducted as a daily charge at an annual rate of 1.25%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants submit that if the mortality and expense risks charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the
mortality and expense risks assumed, the Company will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient,
the excess will be profit to the Company and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other
things, payment of distribution expenses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act requires that all payments received under a periodic payment
plan certificate be held by a qualified trustee or a custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment
to the depositor or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as
the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that the Company is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and
expense risks, and Applicants represent that the aggregate of (i) the daily charge of .80% per annum and (ii) the monthly
charge of .45% per annum is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity products. Applicants state
that this representation is based upon an analysis made by the Company of publicly available information about selected
similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as the right to increase charges above current
levels, the existence of other charges, the number of transfers permitted without charge and the nature of the free
withdrawal provisions. Applicants represent that the Company will maintain at its service office, available to
the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and
results of, the comparative survey made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants submit that for it to be administratively possible for the Contracts to be issued by the Separate Account
(as opposed to a new separate account), the accumulation unit values calculated on a daily basis must equal the accumulated
unit values calculated for existing variable annuity contracts issued by the Separate Account. That can only be accomplished
by deducting a portion of the Contract's mortality and expense risks charge at the Contract level. By splitting the
charge into two components, the Company can avoid the cost of establishing, administering and auditing a new separate
account. Such costs would otherwise have to be passed on to Contractowners in some form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants acknowledge that the withdrawal charge under the Contracts is expected to be insufficient to cover
all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts and that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense
risks charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the withdrawal
charge. In such circumstances a portion of the mortality and expense risks charge might be viewed as providing for
a portion of the costs relating to distribution on the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has
concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with
respect to the Contracts will benefit the Separate Account and the Contractowners. The basis for such conclusion
is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by the Company at its service office and will be available to the
Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Company represents that the Separate Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes,
in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to
have such plan formulated and approved by the particular company's board of directors, a majority of the members of
which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants agree to the following conditions if the order is granted: (1) The fee table examples in the prospectus
for the Contracts will reflect all applicable charges in a manner that will permit comparison with other contracts
on the same basis as if the daily and monthly portions of the mortality and expense risks charge were combined; (2) all
advertisements of the performance of the sub-accounts of the Separate Account will reflect the impact of both elements
of the mortality and expense charge; (3) if the size of this charge is discussed in advertising, it will be presented
as a 1.25% charge, with part deducted daily and part monthly; and (4) changes in accumulation unit values will not be
advertised.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ``Morgan Stanley Group'') constitute a global
financial services firm. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated (``MS&amp;Co.''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Morgan Stanley Group Inc., is the principal broker-dealer affiliate of the Morgan Stanley Group and is registered
as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''). MS&amp;Co. and Morgan Stanley
Group Inc. are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Partnership is a newly-formed Delaware limited partnership that was formed for the purpose of enabling certain
employees, officers, directors, and advisory directors of the Morgan Stanley Group to pool their investment resources
and to participate in various types of investment opportunities, including venture capital and private equity investments,
without the necessity of each investor seeking to identify investments and to analyze their merit. The pooling of
resources permits diversification and participation in investments that usually would not be offered to individual
investors. The goal of the Partnership is to reward and retain key personnel by enabling them to participate in investment
opportunities that would not otherwise be available to them and to attract other individuals to the Morgan Stanley
Group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Partnership will operate as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. The Partnership
will seek to achieve a high rate of return through long-term capital appreciation by providing expansion capital
to a diversified group of private emerging growth companies. The Partnership will co-invest alongside two venture
capital funds (the ``MS Venture Capital Funds'') that recently were organized by the Morgan Stanley Group for third
party investors. The MS Venture Capital Funds are exempt from registration under the Act in reliance upon section
3(c)(1) thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The general partner of the Partnership is Morgan Stanley Venture Partners II, L.P. (the ``General Partner'').
At present, the sole limited partner of the Partnership is Morgan Stanley Venture Capital II, Inc. (``MSVC II''),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The General Partner and MSVC II are registered as investment
advisers under the Advisers Act. MSVC II is the managing general partner of the General Partner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Interests in the Partnership will be offered without registration under a claim of exemption pursuant to section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''). Interests will be offered and sold only to ``Eligible
Employees'' of the Morgan Stanley Group or trusts established by such Eligible Employees for their benefit or the
benefit of their immediate family. To be an Eligible Employee, an individual must currently be an employee, officer,
director, or advisory director of a member of the Morgan Stanley Group and, except for certain individuals who will
manage the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership, and ``accredited investor'' meeting the income requirements
set forth in rule 501(a)(6) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The limitations on the class of persons who may acquire interests, in conjunction with other characteristics of the
Partnership, will qualify the Partnership as an ``employees' securities company'' under section 2(a)(13) of the
Act.

Three of the individuals who will manage the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership are not ``accredited investors.''
Each of these individuals is a partner of the General Partner, had reportable income from all sources in the calendar
year immediately preceding such person's admission as a partner of the General Partner in excess of $120,000, and
has a reasonable expectation of reportable income in the years in which such person will be required to make capital
contributions to the General Partner of at least $150,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Only a small proportion of the Morgan Stanley Group's employees qualify as Eligible Employees. The Eligible Employees
are experienced professionals in the investment banking, merchant banking, or securities business, or in administrative,
financial, accounting, or operational activities related thereto. No Eligible Employee will be required to invest
in the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The management and control of the Partnership, including all investment decisions, is vested exclusively in the
General Partner. The management and control of the General Partner, in turn, is vested exclusively in MSVC II. The
business and affairs of MSVC II is managed by or under the direction of its board of directors (the ``Board''). Thus,
the Board indirectly manages and controls the Partnership. The Board will, among other things, act as the investment
committee of the Partnership responsible for approving all investment and valuation decisions. Actions by the Board
require the vote of a majority of its members. The Board is comprised exclusively of directors and senior officers
of the Morgan Stanley Group, each of whom qualifies as an Eligible Employee. Members of the Board who are not partners
of the General Partner have indicated their intention to participate in the Partnership on the same terms as other
Eligible Employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The day-to-day affairs of the Partnership will be managed by certain individuals who are general and limited partners
of the General Partner. These individuals have primary responsibility for identifying, investigating, structuring,
and monitoring Partnership investments, and making recommendations with respect to investment decisions to the
Board. All such individuals qualify as Eligible Employees and are officers of the Morgan Stanley Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Partnership has obtained subscriptions from a number of Eligible Employees to acquire limited partnership
interests in the Partnership; however, such Eligible Employees have not yet been admitted to the Partnership. In
connection with the subscriptions, each Eligible Employee has deposited an amount equal to 10% of such Eligible Employee's
capital commitment in a segregated interest-bearing account established by MS&amp;Co. (the ``Segregated Account'').
Funds held in the Segregated Account on behalf of an Eligible Employee (including interest) will be returned to such
person if admission to the Partnership does not occur before June 30, 1994, or if the Eligible Employee's subscription
for a limited partnership interest is rejected by the General Partner for any reason.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Upon the occurrence of certain events (including receipt by the Partnership of the requested order), the Eligible
Employees will be admitted to the Partnership as limited partners (the ``Limited Partners''), and all amounts held
in the Segregated Account (including interest on the deposited amounts) will be paid over to the Partnership. Simultaneously
with the occurrence of these events, the limited partnership interest held by MSVC II will be redeemed by the Partnership
in full and MSVC II will receive from the Partnership an amount equal to the sum of (a) the balance of MSVC II's capital
account in the Partnership; (b) the expenses and management fee previously charged against MSVC II's capital account;
and (c) interest on MSVC II's capital contributions to the Partnership calculated at an annual rate of 3% from the date
each such capital contribution was made. Upon their admission into the Partnership, the Eligible Employees will
be treated for all purposes (including without limitation the allocation of Partnership profits and losses) as it
they had been Limited Partners from the initial formation of the Partnership. The date on which Eligible Employees
are initially admitted to the Partnership is hereinafter referred to as the ``Initial Closing.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Board, through the General Partner, will determine in its sole discretion the amount and timing of capital
contributions to be made by the General Partner and the Limited Partners to the Partnership, subject to certain maximum
amounts that may be required during specified periods. Capital contributions will fund Partnership investments
and the payment of Partnership expenses. The capital contribution of each Partner, including the General Partner,
will be applied towards the Partner's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
share of each Partnership investment and each Partnership expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The maximum amount of capital contributions that a Limited Partner may be required to make during the life of the
Partnership will be limited to the Limited Partner's capital commitment. The minimum capital commitment of each
Limited Partner will be $100,000, subject to waiver by the General Partner in its sole discretion. The General Partner
will be authorized to cause the Partnership to raise additional capital after the Initial Closing by admitting, at
one or more additional closings held not later than June 30, 1994, additional Eligible Employees as Limited Partners.
An additional Limited Partner will be required, at the time of admission to the Partnership, to make a capital contribution
and to pay an interest charge to the Partnership as if such Limited Partner had been admitted to the Partnership at the
Initial Closing and the Partnership had made a loan to such Limited Partner for any capital contribution required
during the period from the Initial Closing to the admission date. Such interest charge will be allocated to the capital
accounts of the Partners who had been previously admitted to the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The General Partner has made a capital commitment to the Partnership equal to at least 1% of the Partnership's aggregate
capital commitments. The partners of the General Partner are obligated to make capital contributions to the General
Partner as and when the General Partner is required to make capital contributions to the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The General Partner serves as the sole general partner of one MS Venture Capital Fund and a co-general partner (with
responsibility for investment decisions) of the other MS Venture Capital Fund. The management and control of the
MS Venture Capital Funds are vested exclusively in the General Partner, in its capacity as the general partner of such
Funds. Thus, as in the case of the Partnership, the Board indirectly manages and controls the MS Venture Capital Funds,
and the individual general and limited partners of the General Partner manage the day-to-day affairs of the MS Venture
Capital Funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. The General Partner has made capital commitments to the MS Venture Capital Funds in an aggregate amount of approximately
10.6% of the aggregate capital commitments of the Funds, of which approximately 94% will be funded by MSVC II and approximately
6% will be funded by the individual general partners and limited partners of the General Partner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The General Partner will be paid an annual management fee equal to 2 percent of the Partnership's aggregate capital
commitments, subject to reduction as specified in the Partnership's limited partnership agreement. However, to
the extent the General Partner, its constituent general partners or its employees receive any officers', directors',
broken-deal, remunerative or other net fees (i.e., excluding expense reimbursement) from portfolio companies,
affiliates of portfolio companies, and potential portfolio companies, or to the extent employees of another member
of the Morgan Stanley Group who serve as officers or directors of such entities pursuant to rights held by the Partnership
to designate such officers or directors receive any officers' or directors' fees (excluding expense reimbursement),
a portion of such net fees will reduce the management fee on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The General Partner will pay out of the management fee its normal operating expenses, including rent, salaries
of its personnel, expenses incurred by its personnel in investigating investment opportunities, and communications
and travel expenses. The Partnership will pay certain enumerated expenses of the General Partner and the Partnership
incurred in connection with the organization, operation, and dissolution of the Partnership. Expenses borne by
the Partnership may include the fees, commissions, and expenses of a member of the Morgan Stanley Group for services
performed by such member to the Partnership, including, without limitation, brokerage or clearing services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. The General Partner will be entitled to receive a ``carried interest'' of 12% of the realized and unrealized gains
and losses of the Partnership. The remaining 88% will be shared by all Partners in proportion to their capital commitments.
A ``carried interest'' is an allocation to the General Partner of the Partnership's net gains in addition to the amount
allocable to the General Partner that is in proportion to its capital contributions. For purposes of determining
he Partnership's net gains, management fees and expenses borne by the Partnership, in addition to the Partnership's
realized and unrealized losses, will be netted against the Partnership's realized and unrealized gains. The entire
12% carried interest received by the General Partner will be paid to the individual general and limited partners of
the General Partner. The General Partner's carried interest is structured to comply with the requirements of rule
205&hyph;3 promulgated under the Advisers Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The Partnership will invest all of its capital in investment opportunities in which the MS Venture Capital Funds
invest. The Partnership will not be permitted to make investments other than co-investments with the MS Venture Capital
Funds. In connection with any investment opportunity, except with the consent of an advisory committee consisting
of limited partners of one or both of the MS Venture Capital Funds (the ``Fund Advisory Committee''), the amount of
the Partnership co-investment generally will bear the same proportion to the aggregate investments of the MS Venture
Capital Funds and the Partnership as the aggregate capital commitments of the Partnership bears to the aggregate
capital commitments of the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership (other than with regard to differences that
result from the specific expenses incurred by the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership). In addition, except
with the consent of the Fund Advisory Committee, the Partnership will be required to make any co-investments on terms
no more favorable than those applicable to the investments by the MS Venture Capital Funds.

2&blank;It is anticipated that the economic terms applicable to the Partnership's investments will be the same as
those applicable to the corresponding investments by the MS Venture Capital Funds. It is possible, however, that
the investment of the MS Venture Capital Funds will have more favorable non-economic terms (e.g., the right to representation
on the board of directors of the portfolio company) in light of regulatory or other considerations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Majority or 100% ownership interests in portfolio companies;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. The Partnership will not invest more than 15% of its assets in securities issued by registered investment companies
(with the exception of temporary investments in money market funds), and the Partnership will not acquire any security
issued by a registered investment company if immediately after such acquisition the Partnership will own more than
3% of the outstanding voting stock of the registered investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. An ``MS Related Person,'' as defined below, will not, until the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership are
fully invested, be permitted to make certain types of equity investments in private emerging growth companies without
first having offered the opportunity to make the investment to the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership. An
``MS Related Person'' means the General Partner, Morgan Stanley Group Inc., any other person at least 80% of which
is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by Morgan Stanley Group Inc., and any investment fund managed by any
of the foregoing. Certain investments, however, are not subject to the ``obligation to offer'' described above.
These investments include (a) an investment made by an MS Related Person pursuant to an offer available only to Morgan
Stanley Group Inc. or one of its affiliates; (b) an investment that constitutes compensation for providing investment
banking or other services to any person or entity; (c) an investment relating to an acquisition of a business or assets
to be operated or used in connection with the existing, or a new line of, business of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. or one
of its affiliates (other than the General Partner); (d) an investment made by any MS Related Person in its underwriting
capacity or in connection with broker-dealer activities; (e) an investment made with an aggregate purchase price
of less than $1 million; (f) an investment made by or in connection with an existing investment fund as a follow-on investment
in one of its portfolio companies; and (g) an investment made in connection with the purchase of a portfolio of securities
from another person or entity, subject to certain limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. No individual general or limited partner of the General Partner, and no employee on the General Partner's staff,
will be permitted to co-invest with the Partnership in any investment opportunity, except: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Through an MS Venture Capital Fund as a partner of the General Partner;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As a Limited Partner; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Through the exercise of stock options or warrants granted, on the same terms and amount, to all outside directors
of the entities in which the Partnership invests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Except for the prohibitions described in paragraph 23 above, any member of the Morgan Stanley Group or any client
of such member may co-invest with the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership in connection with any investment
opportunity in which the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership participate. Such co-investments will be made
on terms no more favorable than the terms applicable to the investments by the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership;
however, members will be permitted to invest on more favorable terms if and to the extent such terms are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In full or partial satisfaction of a fee that such members would otherwise be entitled to receive for providing
financial advisory or other services in connection with such co-investment (other than services provided by the
General Partner);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The product of agreements or arrangements entered into by such members (other than the General Partner) with portfolio
companies before the formation of the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Obtained through the exercise of officer's, director's, or similar options or warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. If, in connection with any investment opportunity, there are securities available for investment (determined
after taking into account the proposed investments by the Partnership, the MS Venture Capital Funds and certain other
persons, including other members of the Morgan Stanley Group), such remaining securities will be offered to limited
partners of the MS Venture Capital Funds for co-investment outside the MS Venture Capital Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The Partnership and the MS Venture Capital Funds will not be permitted, except with the consent of the Fund Advisory
Committee, to invest for the first time in portfolio companies in which a member of the Morgan Stanley Group has previously
made an investment, or in which a member is a director or officer. The Partnership and the MS Venture Capital Funds also
will not be permitted, except with the consent of the Fund Advisory Committee, to make a follow-on investment in a portfolio
company previously participated in by a member of the Morgan Stanley Group if, in such round, the member is acquiring
more or less than its

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. Except as described below, the Partnership will be given the opportunity to sell or otherwise dispose of its investments
at the same time and on the same terms as the MS Venture Capital Funds. The General Partner does not intend to make distributions-in-kind
to the Partners of portfolio securities that are subject to restrictions on sale (other than pursuant to rule 144(k)
of the Securities Act) or that cannot be sold due to sales volume limitations, except in connection with distributions
upon the dissolution of the Partnership. Because the Limited Partners generally will be affiliates of Morgan Stanley
Group Inc., the General Partner may elect not to make distributions-in-kind of portfolio securities to the Limited
Partners even though, in its capacity as general partner of the MS Venture Capital Funds, it has decided that a distribution-in-kind
of portfolio securities of the same class as those held by the Partnership is appropriate for the MS Venture Capital
Funds. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any Partnership investment may be reinvested by the General
Partner in Partnership investments, subject to certain limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. Subject to the limitations described above, the Partnership will be permitted to enter into transactions involving:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A member of the Morgan Stanley Group (including without limitation an MS Venture Capital Fund); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any entity in which the Partnership and/or the MS Venture Capital Funds make investments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any partner of an MS Venture Capital Fund that is not a member of the Morgan Stanley Group (together with the affiliates
of such partner, a ``Non-MS Venture Fund Partner''); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any Partner or person or entity related to any Partner. Any such transaction, however, must be on terms no less favorable
to the Partnership than are generally afforded to unrelated third parties in comparable transactions. Such transactions
include, without limitation, the purchase or sale by the Partnership of an investment, or an interest therein, from
or to any member of the Morgan Stanley Group, acting as principal. With respect to any investment purchased by the Partnership
from a member of the Morgan Stanley Group, acting as principal, the Partnership will acquire the investment for no
more than the fair value at the time of purchase, plus carrying costs and certain organizational expenses. The fair
value at the time of such purchase may be more or less than the price paid by the member, depending on the appreciation
or depreciation in the particular investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. A member of the Morgan Stanley Group may provide investment banking, management, or other services and receive
fees or other compensation and expense reimbursement in connection therewith from entities in which the Partnership
makes an investment or competitors of such entities. Such fees or other compensation may include, without limitation,
advisory fees, organization or success fees, financing fees, management fees, performance-based fees, fees for
brokerage and clearing services, and compensation in the form of carried interests entitling the member to share
disproportionately in income or capital gains or similar compensation. The Morgan Stanley Group reserves the right
not to charge or to waive all or part of any such fees or other compensation or expense reimbursement that the Partnership
otherwise might incur or bear indirectly. However, except as described in paragraph 16 above, any such fees or other
compensation or expense reimbursement received by a member of the Morgan Stanley Group will not be shared with the
Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. The Partnership may make distributions to the Partners at such times and in such amounts as determined by the General
Partner in its sole discretion. Until the Limited Partners have received distributions equal to their respective
capital contributions (disregarding, for this purpose, any distributions to enable Partners to pay taxes with respect
to the Partnership's net taxable income allocated to them during any fiscal year), all discretionary distributions
will be made to the Partners in proportion to their respective capital contributions. Thereafter, such distributions
generally will be made 12% to the General Partner and 88% to the Partners, subject to certain limitations. When distributing
cash or securities or both to the Partners, the General Partner will be required to distribute the cash and securities
to all Partners in the same proportions; however, the General Partner will have the right, with the consent of Limited
Partners representing at least two-thirds of the aggregate capital commitments, to make fair non-ratable distributions
in kind. Such non-ratable distributions would be made in the event a Limited Partner notifies a General Partner that
the receipt by such Limited Partner of a specific portfolio security would violate any law, regulation, or government
order applicable to such Limited Partner. No distribution may be made to a Partner to the extent that such distribution
would (a) create or increase a deficit balance in such Partner's account, or (b) render such Partner liable for a return
of such distribution under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. The General Partner will conduct a valuation of the Partnership's assets each time items of Partnership profit
or loss (including unrealized gains and losses) are to be allocated to the capital accounts of the Partners; at the
time of any distribution in kind to the Partners; and in connection with the preparation of periodic reports to the
Partners. The General Partner's valuation of any securities will be conclusive and binding on all parties; however,
if Limited Partners representing at least a majority of the aggregate capital commitments object to any valuation,
a procedure exists for submitting the valuation to arbitration. The rules applicable to the valuation of Partnership
assets are the same as those applicable to the valuation of assets of the MS Venture Capital Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. The Partnership will be permitted to borrow money, subject to limitations as to the aggregate principal amount
and maturity of indebtedness that may be incurred by the Partnership. It is not anticipated that a member of the Morgan
Stanley Group will advance funds to the Partnership but, if any such advances are made, the terms thereof will be no
less favorable to the Partnership than would be obtained on an arm's-length basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
33. Pending investment of capital contributions from the Partners and any distribution of proceeds to the Partners,
the Partnership's funds may be invested in short-term money market or other comparable investments, including money
market funds that may be advised by a member of the Morgan Stanley Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. The term of the Partnership will expire on the tenth anniversary of the date on which capital contributions are
first made to the Partnership. The term may be extended by the General Partner, with the consent of Limited Partners
representing specified percentages (depending upon the extension being sought) of the aggregate capital commitments.
The Partnership may be dissolved prior to the expiration of the term with the approval of Partners representing at
least two-thirds of the aggregate capital commitments. In addition, the Partnership may be dissolved upon the occurrence
of certain events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. A Limited Partner may not withdraw from the Partnership prior to the dissolution of the Partnership, except under
certain limited circumstances. The General Partner may require a Limited Partner to withdraw (a) if the Limited Partner
is a Defaulting Partner (as defined below); (b) if the Limited Partner violates the restrictions on transfer described
below; or (c) if the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion that continued membership of the Limited
Partner in the Partnership would subject the Partnership to material onerous legal or other regulatory requirements
that cannot reasonably be avoided. A Limited Partner may not withdraw in any event until the first anniversary of such
Limited Partner's admission to the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. If any Limited Partner fails to make any required capital contribution when due or called by the General Partner
(a ``Defaulting Partner''), the General Partner may elect in its discretion any one or more of the following alternatives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Cause the Partnership to bring an action against the Defaulting Partner to collect the due and unpaid payment plus
interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Cause the Defaulting Partner to forfeit up to 50% of the value of such Defaulting Partner's capital account (as
valued at the date the capital contribution was originally due), which forfeited portion will be allocated among
the other Partners in proportion to their respective capital contributions, provided that the General Partner will
not elect this alternative if the Defaulting Partner is suffering from, or will suffer, severe hardship;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Determine that the Defaulting Partner will not be permitted to make additional capital contributions; and/or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Reduce the Defaulting Partner's share of the Partnership's future profits by up to 50% of the amount that such Defaulting
Partner would otherwise have been entitled to receive had it not defaulted. These rights and remedies are cumulative,
and the General Partner may pursue any other remedies available to it or the Partnership to enforce the obligation
of the Defaulting Partner. The Defaulting Partner is liable for all costs of the Partnership, including attorney's
fees, incurred with respect to the collection of any of the capital contributions and the enforcement of any of the
rights of the Partnership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
37. Interests in the Partnership will be non-transferable except with the prior written consent of the General Partner,
which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion, and in any event, will not be transferable to persons other than
(a) other Partners; (b) trusts established by the transferor Limited Partner for the benefit of such Limited Partner
or such Limited Partner's immediate family; or (c) by succession or testamentary disposition upon the death of the
transferor Limited Partner. A Limited Partner's interest will not be redeemable upon, and will not be affected by,
such Limited Partner's termination of employment from the Morgan Stanley Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. During the existence of the Partnership, books of account will be kept, in which the General Partner will enter,
or cause to be entered, all business transacted by the Partnership, all moneys and other things received, advanced,
paid out, or delivered on behalf of the Partnership, the results of the Partnership's operations, and each Partner's
capital. Such books will at all times be accessible to all Partners. In addition, for each fiscal year of the Partnership,
the General Partner will cause an examination of the financial statements of the Partnership to be made in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards by a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants. A copy
of the accountants' report with respect to each fiscal year will be furnished to each Partner within a specified period
after the end of such fiscal year. The General Partner will also furnish certain information to the Partners on a quarterly
basis. The scope and nature of the information furnished to the Limited Partners is the same as that furnished to the
third party investors of the MS Venture Capital Funds.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant requests an exemption under sections 6(b) and 6(e) of the Act from all provisions of the Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, except section 9, sections 17 and 30 (except as described below), sections 36 through
53, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to (a) permit a member of the
Morgan Stanley Group, acting as principal, to engage in any transaction directly or indirectly with the Partnership
or any company controlled by the Partnership; (b) permit the Partnership to invest in or engage in any transaction
with any entity, acting as principal, (i) in which the Partnership, any company controlled by the Partnership, or
any member of the Morgan Stanley Group has invested or will invest, or (ii) with which the Partnership, any company
controlled by the Partnership, or any member of the Morgan Stanley Group is or will become otherwise affiliated; and
(c) permit a Non-MS Venture Fund Partner, acting as principal, to engage in any transaction directly or indirectly
with the Partnership or any company controlled by the Partnership. The transactions to which the Partnership is a
party will be effected only after a determination by the Board that the requirements of Condition 1 below have been
satisfied. In addition, these transactions will be effected only to the extent not prohibited by the limited partnership
agreements of the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The principal reason for the requested exemption is to ensure that the Partnership will be able to invest in companies,
properties, or vehicles in which a member of the Morgan Stanley Group (including without limitation an MS Venture
Capital Fund), or the member's employees, officers, directors, or advisory directors, or the partners of an MS Venture
Capital Fund, may make or have already made an investment. The relief is also requested to permit the Partnership the
flexibility to deal with its portfolio investments in the manner the General Partner deems most advantageous to all
Partners or as required by the MS Venture Capital Funds or the Partnership's other co-investors. Furthermore, the
requested exemption is sought to ensure that a Non-MS Venture Fund Partner will not directly or indirectly become
subject to a burden, restriction, or other adverse effect by virtue of the Partnership's participation in an investment
opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Partners will have been fully informed of the possible extent of the partnership's dealings with an MS Venture
Capital Fund or another member of the Morgan Stanley Group or with a Non-MS Venture Partner and, as professionals employed
in the securities business, will be able to understand and evaluate the attendant risks. Applicant asserts that the
community of interest among the Partners, on the one hand, and an MS Venture Capital Fund or another member of the Morgan
Stanley Group or the Non-MS Venture Fund Partners, on the other hand, is the best insurance against any risk of abuse.

5. Applicant states that the Partnership will not make loans to an MS Venture Capital Fund or any other member of the
Morgan Stanley Group, or to any employee, officer, director, or advisory director of the Morgan Stanley Group, with
the exception of short-term repurchase agreements or other fully secured loans to a member of the Morgan Stanley Group.
In addition, the Partnership will not sell or lease any property to an MS Venture Capital Fund or any other member of
the Morgan Stanley Group except on terms at least as favorable as those obtainable from unaffiliated third parties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit
affiliated persons of the Partnership (including without limitation the General Partner, the MS Venture Capital
Funds, and other members of the Morgan Stanley Group) or affiliated persons of any of these persons (including without
limitation the Non-MS Venture Fund Partners) to participate in, or effect any transaction in connection with, any
joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the Partnership or a company controlled
by the Partnership is a participant. The exemption requested would permit, among other things, co-investments by
the Partnership and individual partners or employees, officers, directors, or advisory directors of the Morgan
Stanley Group making their own individual investment decisions apart from the Morgan Stanley Group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Compliance with section 17(d) would prevent the Partnership from achieving its principal purpose. Because of
the number and sophistication of the potential Partners and persons affiliated with such Partners, strict compliance
with section 17(d) would cause the Partnership to forego investment opportunities simply because a Partner or other
affiliated person of the Partnership (or any affiliate of such a person) also had, or contemplated making, a similar
investment. In addition, attractive investment opportunities of the types considered by the Partnership often
require each participant in the transaction to make available funds in an amount that may be substantially greater
than may be available to the Partnership alone. As a result, the only way in which the Partnership may be able to participate
in such opportunities may be to co-invest with other persons, including its affiliates. The requested exemption
also is sought to ensure that a Non-MS Venture Fund Partner will not directly or indirectly become subject to a burden,
restriction, or other adverse effect by virtue of the Partnership's participation in an investment opportunity.
The flexibility to structure co-investments and joint investments in the manner described above will not involve
abuses of the type section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 were designed to prevent. The concern that permitting co-investments
or joint investments by an MS Venture Capital Fund or another member of the Morgan Stanley Group or by the Non-MS Venture
Fund Partners on the one hand, and the Partnership on the other, might lead to less advantageous treatment of the Partnership
should be mitigated by the fact that (a) the Morgan Stanley Group, in addition to its substantial stake as a general
partner in the MS Venture Capital Funds and investments in the Partnership and in the portfolio companies in which
the Partnership invests, will be acutely concerned with its relationship with the key personnel who invest in the
Partnership; and (b) senior officers and directors of the Morgan Stanley Group will be investing in the Partnership.

8. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(f) and rule 17f&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit a member
of the Morgan Stanley Group to act as custodian without a written contract. Because there is such a close association
between the Partnership and the Morgan Stanley Group, requiring a detailed written contract would expose the Partnership
to unnecessary burden and expense. Furthermore, any securities of the Partnership held by the Morgan Stanley Group
will have the protection of fidelity bonds. An exemption is requested from the terms of rule 17f&hyph;1(b)(4), as
applicant does not believe the expense of retaining an independent accountant to conduct periodic verifications
is warranted given the community of interest of all the parties involved and the existing requirement for an independent
annual audit.

9. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(g) and rule 17g&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit the Partnership
to comply with rule 17g&hyph;1 by having a majority of the members of the Board take such actions and make such approvals
as are set forth in rule 17g&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicant requests an exemption from Section 17(j) and rule 17j&hyph;1 (except rule 17j&hyph;1(a)) because
the requirements contained therein are burdensome and unnecessary in the context of the Partnership. Requiring
the Partnership to adopt a written code of ethics and requiring access persons to report each of their securities transactions
would be time consuming and expensive, and would serve little purpose in light of, among other things, the community
of interest among the Partners by virtue of their common association in the Morgan Stanley Group; the substantial
and largely overlapping protections afforded by the conditions with which the Applicant has agreed to comply; the
concern of the Morgan Stanley Group that personnel who participate in the Partnership actually receive the benefits
they expect to receive when investing in the Partnership; and the fact that the investments of the Partnership will
be investments that usually would not be offered to the Partners, including those Partners who would be deemed access
persons, as individual investors. Accordingly, the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Act,
because the dangers against which section 17(j) and rule 17j&hyph;1 are intended to guard are not present in the case
of the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Sections 30(a), 30(b) and 30(d), and the rules under those sections, generally require that registered investment
companies prepare and file with the Commission and mail to their shareholders certain periodic reports and financial
statements. The forms prescribed by the Commission for periodic reports have little relevance to the Partnership
and would entail administrative and legal costs that outweigh any benefit to the Limited Partners. Exemptive relief
is requested to the extent necessary to permit the partnership to report annually to its Partners in the manner described
above in paragraph 37. An exemption also is requested from section 30(f) to the extent necessary to exempt the General
Partner, MSVC II, members of the Board, and any other persons who may be deemed members of an advisory board of the Partnership
from filing Forms 3, 4 and 5 under section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to their ownership of interests in the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicant submits that the exemptions requested are consistent with the protection of investors in view of the
substantial community of interest among all the parties and the fact that the Partnership is an ``employees' securities
company'' as defined in section 2(a)(13). The Partnership was conceived and will be organized and managed by person
who will be investing in the Partnership, and will not be promoted by persons seeking to profit from fees or investment
advice or from the distribution of securities. Applicant also submits that the terms of the proposed affiliated transactions
will be reasonable and fair and free from overreaching.

Applicant agrees that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each proposed transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) or section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 to which

Partner, determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable to the
Partners and do not involve overreaching of the Partnership or its Partners on the part of any person concerned; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The transaction is consistent with the interests of the Partners, the Partnership's organizational documents
and the Partnership's reports to its Partners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the General Partner will record and preserve a description of such affiliated transactions, their findings,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. In connection with the Section 17 Transactions, the Board, through the General Partner, will adopt, and periodically
review and update, procedures designed to ensure that reasonable inquiry is made, prior to the consummation of any
such transaction, with respect to the possible involvement in the transaction of any affiliated person or promoter
of or principal underwriter for the Partnership, or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal
underwriter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The General Partner will not invest the funds of the Partnership in any investment in which a ``Co-Investor,'' as
defined below, has or proposes to acquire the same class of securities of the same issuer, where the investment involves
a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1 in which the Partnership and the
Co-Investor are participants, unless any such Co-Investor, prior to disposing of all or part of its investment, (a)
gives the General Partner sufficient, but not less than one day's, notice of its intent to dispose of its investment;
and (b) refrains from disposing of its investment unless the Partnership has the opportunity to dispose of the Partnership's
investment prior to or concurrently with, and on the same terms as, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A company in which the General Partner acts as a general partner or has a similar capacity to control the sale or other
disposition of the company's securities (including without limitation each MS Venture Capital Fund). The restrictions
contained in this condition, however, shall not be deemed to limit or prevent the disposition of an investment by a
Co-Investor: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) To its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, to any company (a ``parent'') of which the Co-Investor is a
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, or to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To immediate family members of the Co-Investor or a trust established for any such family member; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the investment is comprised of securities that are listed on any exchange registered as a national securities
exchange under section 6 of the Exchange Act; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When the investment is comprised of securities that are national market system securities pursuant to section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Partnership and the General Partner will maintain and preserve, for the life of the Partnership and at least
two years thereafter, such accounts, books, and other documents as constitute the record forming the basis for the
audited financial statements that are to be provided to the Partners, and each annual report of the Partnership required
to be sent to the Partners, and agree that all such records will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.

time during the fiscal year then ended Partnership financial statements audited by the Partnership's independent
accountants. At the end of each fiscal year, the General Partner will make a valuation or have a valuation made of all

of the Partnership or as soon as practicable thereafter, the General Partner shall send a report to each person who

for the preparation by the partner of his or its federal and state income tax returns and a report of the investment activities

6. In any case where purchases or sales are made by the Partnership from or to an entity affiliated with the Partnership
by reason of a 5% or more investment in such entity by a Morgan Stanley Group advisory director, director, officer,
or employee, such individual will not participate in the Partnership's determination of whether or not to effect
such purchases or sale.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Southern Company (``Southern''), 64 Perimeter Center East, Atlanta, Georgia 30346, a registered holding company,
has filed a declaration pursuant to sections 6(a), 7 and 12(e) of the Act and Rules 50(a)(5), 62 and 65 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes to adopt, subject to shareholder approval at the 1994 annual meeting of shareholders to be held
on May 25, 1994 (``1994 Annual Meeting''), The Southern Company Outside Directors Stock Plan (``Plan''). Under the
Plan, Southern proposes to issue, from time-to-time through December 31, 2004, up to one million shares of common
stock, par value of $5 (``Common Stock''). Southern states that the purpose of the Plan is to provide a mechanism for
non-employee directors to automatically increase their ownership of Southern Common Stock and thereby further
align their interests with those of the shareholders of Southern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan will be newly issued shares which have been authorized but unissued
shares or shares that will be acquired on the open market pursuant to a prior authorization. The Plan provides that
any member of the board of directors who is not otherwise actively employed by Southern or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates shall receive a portion of the annual retainer fee (currently $30,000) equal to $5,000 in unrestricted
Common Stock, with the remainder of to be payable in increments elected by the director, in cash or in Common Stock.
Southern requests an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50 under the Act pursuant to subsection
(a)(5) in connection with any issuance or sale of Common Stock under the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Southern requests authorization to solicit proxies from its shareholders for approval of the Plan,
among other things, at its 1994 Annual Meeting. Southern requests that the effectiveness of its declaration with
respect to the solicitation of proxies for voting by its shareholders on the Plan be permitted to become effective
as provided in Rule 62(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appearing to the Commission that the declaration regarding the proposed solicitation of proxies should be permitted
to become effective forthwith, pursuant to Rule 62:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Leidy Hub, Inc. (``Leidy''), formerly Enerop Corporation (``Enerop''), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York
14203, a nonutility subsidiary company of National Fuel Gas Company (``National''), a registered holding company,
has filed a post-effective amendment under sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act to its application-declaration which was
originally filed under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By orders dated May 1, 1986 and March 18, 1988 (HCAR Nos. 24081 and 24604, respectively), the Commission authorized,
in relevant part: (1) National to loan $200,000 to Metscan, Inc. (``Metscan''), a New York corporation that has developed
an electronic meter reading system (``Metscan System''), and to receive an option to convert the note (``Note'')
evidencing the loan into 80,000 shares of Metscan's preferred stock, at a price of $2.50 per share; (2) National to
assign the Note and option from Metscan to Enerop; (3) National to provide Enerop $442,500 as a contribution to capital,
which funds Enerop was authorized to invest, together with third parties, in Metscan Technology Partners (``Partnership''),
a New York partnership formed by Metscan, after which Enerop would own approximately 9.96% of the Partnership; and
(4) the Partnership and Metscan to be reorganized as a corporation before the end of 1989, and Enerop to acquire approximately
7.23% of the common stock of the new corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 18, 1988 order contained a reservation of jurisdiction over this reorganization which was released by order
dated April 27, 1989 (HCAR No. 24874). The reorganization occurred on May 17, 1989, and the new corporation was called
Metscan Acquisition Corporation (``MAC''). Pursuant to the reorganization, the Note and Enerop's Partnership
interest attributable to the $442,500 investment were converted into 80,000 shares and 177,000 shares of MAC common
stock, respectively, at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share. MAC subsequently changed its name to Metscan, Inc.,
and the 257,000 shares that Enerop then owned represented 6.0% of the total shares of Metscan common stock outstanding,
and 5.1% of that total if shares subject to outstanding warrants and employees' options were included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By order dated September 7, 1990 (HCAR No. 25143), the Commission authorized Enerop to acquire an additional 143,000
shares of Metscan common stock for $357,500 ($2.50 per share), and 39,500 shares of Metscan Class A Preferred Stock
(``Class A Preferred'') for $158,000 ($4 per share). The Class A Preferred pays a cumulative annual 7% dividend, and
is convertible by the stockholders to Metscan common stock on a 1:1 basis, through July of 1995. As a result of the September
7, 1990 order, Enerop owned 9.4% of Metscan's common stock and 7.1% of Metscan's Class A Preferred, or 7.9% of such common
stock if the Class A Preferred stock is converted into common stock, and if all warrants and other rights are exercised.

Finally, by order dated July 12, 1991 (HCAR No. 25346), Enerop was authorized to purchase 17,000 additional shares
of the Class A Preferred for $68,000 ($4 per share). Following the acquisition, Enerop owned 9.4% of Metscan's common
stock and 9.8% of the Class A Preferred, or about 8.2% of the actual and potential equity investment in Metscan. Enerop's
total investment in Metscan then totaled $1,226,000. On December 29, 1993, Enerop changed its name to Leidy Hub, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leidy now proposes to acquire 29,167 shares of Metscan Class B Preferred Stock, $.01 par value, (``Class B Preferred''),
out of a total number of 2,736,667 shares to be sold, for $35,000 ($1.20 per share). Once the proposed transaction has
been consummated, Leidy will own 7.31% of Metscan's common stock, 9.83% of the Class A Preferred and 1.07% of the Class
B Preferred, or about 5.52% of the actual and potential equity investment in Metscan. Leidy will, however, divest
itself of all interest in Metscan within ten years of the acquisition of the Class B Preferred.

Entergy Corporation (70&hyph;8149)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, a registered holding company,
has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 32, and 33 of the Act and Rules 53 and 54 thereunder. The Commission issued
a notice of the declaration on April 9, 1993 (HCAR No. 25789). Since then, Entergy has filed an amendment which requires
the Commission to issue a second notice of the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entergy proposes to enter into arrangements with one or more banks to effect borrowings and reborrowings by Entergy
from time to time for a period not to exceed three years, of not more than $300 million by issuing to participating banks
(``Banks'') its unsecured promissory notes (``Notes'') payable no later than three years from the date of their issuance.
The proposed borrowing arrangements will be contained in a credit agreement among Entergy and the Banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each borrowing by Entergy could either be made 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 among the Banks, or be allocated among one or more of the Banks in such proportions as the Banks and Entergy shall agree.
Each payment by Entergy with respect to a borrowing would be made 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 among the Banks according to their respective ratable portions of the such borrowings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed arrangements, each borrowing would bear interest from the date thereof on the unpaid principal
amount thereof at a rate per annum selected by Entergy from a number of rate options. These rate options include: (1)
The higher of (a) the prime commercial rate of a specified bank (or an average of such rates of some or all of the Banks)
from time to time in effect and (b) a specified margin (not in excess of 1%) above rates on overnight Federal funds transactions
on a given day (or the average of such rates for a specified period) (``Prime Rate''); (2) the sum of (c) specified offered
rates for certificates of deposit of a specified Bank (or an average of such rates of some of all of the Banks) for the
amounts equivalent to such borrowing and for selected interest periods, appropriately adjusted for the cost of reserves
and F.D.I.C. insurance and (d) a margin not in excess of 1.5% per annum (``CD Rate''); (3) the sum of (e) specified rates
offered for U.S. dollar deposits by or to a specified Bank (or an average of such rates of some or all of the Banks) in the
interbank Eurodollar market for amounts equivalent to such borrowing and for selected interest periods, appropriately
adjusted for the cost of reserves and (f) a margin not in excess of 1.25% per annum (``LIBOR Rate''); or (4) a rate negotiated
at the time of borrowing with one or more Banks, which would not in any event exceed a maximum rate of the Prime Rate plus
2% per annum, appropriately adjusted for the cost of bidding or negotiation (``Competitive Advance Rate'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entergy states that generally interest on Prime Rate borrowings would be payable quarterly, and interest on CD Rate
and LIBOR Rate borrowings would be payable at the end of selected interest periods for such borrowings, or, depending
upon the length of such selected interest periods, at specified intervals within such periods and at the end thereof.
Interest on Competitive Advance Rate borrowings would be payable on such dates as are agreed to by Entergy and Banks
funding such borrowings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Entergy may agree to pay to each Bank a facility and/or commitment fee for the period from the commencement of the borrowing
arrangements to and including the date of termination of the commitments, computed at a rate not in excess of 1/2 of
1% per annum of the total commitments (in the case of a commitment fee) in effect during the period for which payment
is made. Entergy also may agree to pay to the agent Bank (if any) an agent fee for the period from the commencement of the
borrowing arrangements to and including the date of termination of the commitments, not in excess of $200,000 per
year. The facility and/or commitment fee and agent fee would be payable on a quarterly basis and on the date upon which
Entergy shall terminate the commitments. Entergy also may agree to pay to the Banks an up-front fee not in excess of
1% of the total commitments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proceeds of the borrowings under the proposed arrangements will be used by Entergy for general corporate purposes,
including: (1) The acquisition of shares of Entergy's outstanding common stock pursuant to outstanding Commission
authorization and any future similar authorizations; (2) further investments by Entergy in related non-utility
businesses, subject to receipt of any further Commission approval, if necessary; and (3) investments in exempt wholesale
generators and foreign utility companies.

Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''), a registered holding company, and EUA Service Corporation (``EUA Service''
and together with EUA, ``Applicants''), a wholly-owned subsidiary, each located at One Liberty Square, P.O. Box
2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, have filed a declaration pursuant to Section 12(c) of the Act and Rule 46(a) thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated February 18, 1986 (HCAR No. 24020) (``1986 Order''), the Commission authorized EUA to make capital
contributions to EUA Service in order to support interim financing for constructing EUA Service's office complex
(the ``Service Center''). EUA made a $5 million equity capital contribution to EUA Service during 1987. The 1986 Order
also authorized EUA Service to charge other companies in the system amounts in order to provide a return on EUA Service's
equity capital, as increased by the capital contribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated December 18, 1987 (HCAR No. 24543) (``1987 Order''), the Commission authorized EUA Service to issue
and sell up to $20 million in notes (``Notes'') to pay or reduce outstanding short-term borrowings incurred to construct
the Service Center. The Notes mature in 2008 and are being repaid pursuant to a sinking fund schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants state that EUA Service desires to reduce the $5 million in equity capital in order to reduce its fees
to companies in the EUA holding company system. The Applicants further state that reducing this amount over the next
fifteen years will permit payments out of internally generated cash and avoid the incurrence of additional debt to
finance the payments. EUA Service proposes to declare and pay dividends to EUA out of EUA Service's paid-in capital
account, from time to time through December 31, 2008, in amounts aggregating $5 million. Specifically, EUA Service
proposes to pay $500,000 in 1994, $1,000,000 in each of 1995 and 1996, and $200,000 annually through 2008.

Gulf Power Company (70&hyph;8397)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gulf Power Company (``Gulf''), 500 Bayfront Parkway, Pensacola, Florida 32501, a subsidiary of The Southern Company,
a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 6(b), 7 and 12(d) of the
Act and rules 44 and 50(a)(5) thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf proposes to issue and sell from time to time, prior to January 1, 1997, short-term and/or term-loan notes to lenders,
commercial paper to dealers and/or non-negotiable promissory notes to public entities in exchange for the proceeds
of their revenue anticipation notes in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of up to $150,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf states that any borrowings proposed herein may be, and any such borrowings in excess of its charter limits on short-term
unsecured debt would be, secured by a subordinated lien on certain assets of Gulf. In no circumstances will Gulf have
unsecured borrowings outstanding at any one time that exceed applicable charter limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf proposes to borrow from certain banks or other lending institutions. Such institutional borrowings will be
evidenced by notes to be dated as of the date of such borrowings and to mature in not more than four years after the date
of issue, or by ``grid'' notes evidencing all outstanding borrowings from each lender to be dated as of the date of the
initial borrowing and to mature not more than four years after the date of issue. Gulf proposes that any note evidencing
such borrowings may not be prepayable, or that it may be prepaid with payment of a premium that is not in excess of the
stated interest rate on the borrowing to be prepaid, which premium in the case of a note having a maturity of more than
one year, may thereafter decline to the date of the note's final maturity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Borrowings will be at the lender's prevailing rate offered to corporate borrowers of similar quality. Such rates
will not exceed the prime rate or (i) LIBOR plus up to 3/4 of 1%, (ii) the lender's certificate of deposit rate plus up
to 1%, or (iii) a rate not to exceed the prime rate to be established by bids obtained from the lenders prior to a proposed
borrowing; provided, however, that with respect to borrowings with a maturity in excess of one year, the rate will
not exceed the yield for a comparable maturity Treasury note plus one percent. Compensation for the credit facilities
may be provided by balances of up to 10% of the available facility or by fees of up to 1/2 of 1% per annum of the amount of
the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf also proposes to issue and sell commercial paper to dealers from time to time prior to January 1, 1997. Such commercial
paper to dealers will be in the form of promissory notes with varying maturities not to exceed nine months. The commercial
paper notes will be issued in denominations of not less than $50,000 and will not by their terms be prepayable prior
to maturity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulf also may effect short-term borrowings in connection with the financing of certain pollution control facilities
through the issuance by public entities of their revenue bond anticipation notes. Under an agreement with each such
public entity, the entity would effectively loan to Gulf the proceeds of the sale of such revenue bond anticipation
notes, having a maturity of not more than one year after date of issue, and Gulf may issue its non-negotiable promissory
note therefore. Such note would provide for payments thereon to be made at times and in amounts which shall correspond
to the payments with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, which shall not exceed the prime rate,
on such revenue bond anticipation notes, whenever and in whatever manner the same shall become due, whether it stated
maturity, upon redemption or declaration or otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prior Commission orders in File No. 70&hyph;7937 dated March 31, 1992, November 30, 1993 and February 16, 1994 (HCAR
Nos. 25507, 25932 and 25989, respectively), Gulf may effect short-term borrowings prior to April 1, 1996. Gulf proposes
that the authorization sought herein will supersede and replace, with respect to Gulf, authorizations in File No.
70&hyph;7937 effective immediately upon the date of the Commission's order herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proceeds from the proposed borrowings will be used by Gulf for working capital purposes, including the financing
in part of its construction program. None of the proceeds from any borrowing or from the sale of the notes proposed herein
will be used by Gulf, directly or indirectly, for the acquisition of any interest in an ``exempt wholesale generator''
or a ``foreign utility company.''

2. At a joint meeting held on March 31, 1993, the boards of trustees of applicant and SunAmerica Income Funds (the ``Acquiring
Company''), a series company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, approved an agreement and plan of reorganization
(the ``Agreement'') between applicant and the Acquiring Company. The Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are collectively referred to as the ``Reorganization.'' The Agreement provided for the transfer of all of
the assets and liabilities of applicant's series, SunAmerica Tax Exempt Insured Fund (the ``Fund'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 in exchange for shares of SunAmerica Tax Exempt Insured Fund (the ``Acquiring Fund''). The Acquiring Company is a
series company organized as a Massachusetts business trust,

 and the Acquiring Fund is a series of the Acquiring Company.

3. Applicant stated in proxy materials filed in connection with the Reorganization that the purpose of the Reorganization

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicant, the Acquiring company, and the Acquiring Fund are ``affiliated persons'' of each other, as that term
is defined in the Act, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common trustees, and common officers.
Applicant and the Acquiring Company relied on rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act in order to exempt the transaction from
the affiliated transaction prohibition of section 17(a) of the Act. To avail itself of the rule 17a&hyph;8 exemption,
each of the boards of directors of applicant and the Acquiring Company determined that the Reorganization was in the
best interest of the shareholders and that the interests of existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result
of the Reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Preliminary proxy materials were filed on June 17, 1993, as part of the Acquiring Company's registration statement
on Form N&hyph;14. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Reorganization were filed on July 29, 1993, and mailed
to applicant's shareholders on or about that date. Applicant's shareholders voted to approve the Agreement on September
23, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As of October 1, 1993, applicant had 14,839,217.351 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of
$190,683,942.96, and a per share net asset value of $12.85. On October 1, 1993, pursuant to the Agreement, applicant
transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund. The
aggregate net asset value of Acquiring Fund shares received was equal to the net asset value of the Fund's shares held.
Applicant then distributed the Acquiring Fund's shares it received

pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to its shareholders, in complete liquidation of applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the Reorganization. Pursuant to the Agreement, the expenses
for effecting the Reorganization were borne by the participating funds, including applicant and the Acquiring Company.
Such expenses, which are not expected to exceed $50,000 for applicant, include preparation of proxy materials, printing
expenses, and legal and accounting fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any
business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. On March 23, 1994, applicant filed a certificate of Termination of Trust with the Massachusetts Secretary of State.

SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants seek an order, on behalf of the Trust and all investment companies for which the Adviser in the future becomes
investment adviser and the Distributor in the future becomes principal underwriter, amending a prior order (the
``Prior Order'') that permitted the establishment of a dual class and contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'')
arrangement. Investment Company Act Release Nos. 18460 (Dec. 31, 1991) (notice) and 18502 (Jan. 28, 1992) (order).
The requested amended order will modify the multi-class arrangement allowed by the Prior Order to, among other things,
allow the Trust to issue a third class of shares for one of its series (the ``Multi-Class Plan''). Except with respect
to the imposition of the CDSC, the requested amended order will supersede the Prior Order in its entirety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is a registered open-end management investment company organized in series form. The Trust currently
has six series: Money Market Series, Government Securities Series, Priority Selection List Series, Zweig Strategy
Fund, Zweig Appreciation Fund and Zweig Managed Assets (collectively and individually, the ``Series''). The Trust
has from time to time created new Series and may do so in the future. The Adviser serves as the investment manager of the
Trust. The Distributor acts as the principal distributor of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust (``Shares'').
Pursuant to the Prior Order, the Trust presently offers two classes of Shares: Class A shares and Class B Shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A new series of the Trust, Zweig Cash Fund (``New Cash Fund'') is being created to become the successor by merger to
Money Market Series, a series of the Trust, and Zweig Cash Fund Inc. (``Cash Fund''), an affiliated money market fund
with the same investment adviser and distributor as the Trust. In connection with that merger, the Trust proposes
to create a new class of Shares (the ``Class M Shares''), which will be exchanged for the assets of Cash Fund and then
distributed to Cash Fund shareholders in complete liquidation of such Fund. In addition, Money Market Series will
transfer its assets to New Cash Fund in exchange for Class A and Class B shares of New Cash Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Class A Shares of five Series of the Trust are sold with a sliding scale initial sales charge. Class A Shares of Money
Market Series are sold without an initial sales charge, and Class A Shares of New Cash Fund will also be sold without
an initial sales charge. As provided in a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act (the ``Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plan''), the Class A Shares of each Series pays the Distributor distribution fees of .05% and service fees of .25% of
average daily net assets per annum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Class B Shares of the Trust are sold without the imposition of an initial sales charge, but they are subject to
a CDSC of 1.25% of the net asset value of shares redeemed within one year of purchase. No CDSC is imposed on Class B Shares
redeemed thereafter. Under the rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan, the Distributor is paid a distribution fee of .75% per annual
of average daily net assets of Class B Shares of four Series, .50% for one Series, and .05% for Money Market Series. In
each case, the Distributor also is paid a service fee of .25%. New Cash Fund will have the same pricing structure as Money
Market Series, and the Class B Shares will pay an annual distribution and service fee of .05% and .25%, respectively,
of average daily net assets (the same as paid by the Class A Shares).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Under the Multi-Class Plan, the Trust will continue to offer Class A and B Shares on the same terms as are presently
offered, and New Cash Fund will also offer Class M Shares. Class M Shares will be sold without a front-end sales charge
or CDSC but subject to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan that requires the Class M Shares of New Cash Fund to pay up to .15% per annum
of average daily net assets to securities dealers, financial institutions and other industry professionals for
distribution, promotion and administration of and/or servicing investors in Class M Shares, and for payment by the
Class M Shares for prospectuses, reports and promotional material in an amount not to exceed $100,000 per year. The
Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan for Class M Shares of New Cash Fund will be identical to the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan presently in effect
for shares of Cash Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Although there are no present plans for offering other classes of shares of the Trust (including Class M Shares of
the other Series of the Trust), the terms of which may differ from the classes of shares described herein and in the application,
the Trust may choose to do so in the future. Any such new classes, however, would comply with all of the conditions set
forth below. The sum of any initial sales charge, asset-based sales charge, and CDSC for the existing or any new classes
will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the
National Association of Securities Dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Under the Multi-Class Plan, each share of a Series will represent an equal pro rata interest in a Series, regardless
of class, and will be identical in all respects except for: (1) The amount and type of fees permitted by Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plans and the terms of service agreements, if applicable; (2) voting rights on matters concerning Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plans; (3) exchange privileges; (4) any expenses which the Board of Trustees determines should be allocated or charged
on a class basis (``Differential Expenses''), which are limited to (a) transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer
agent as attributable to a specific class, (b) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing
class specific material such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders, (c) Blue
Sky and Commission registration fees incurred by a class of Shares, (d) the expenses of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, if any, (e) litigation or other legal expenses
relating solely to a specific class of Shares, (f) trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class
of Shares and (g) other expenses that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class
of shares which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; and (5) the designation of such classes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Under the Multi-Class Plan, all expenses incurred by each Series will be allocated among the various classes of
shares based upon the net assets of the Series attributable to each class, except that shares of a particular class
will bear the Differential Expenses incurred by such class. In addition, shares of a particular class will bear expenses
assessed to that class as a result of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for a distribution fee or a service fee. Consequently,
the net income of, and the dividends payable with respect to, each particular class would generally differ from the
net income of, and the dividends payable with respect to, the other classes of shares of each Series. Therefore, the
net asset value per share of the classes will differ at times. Expenses of each Series allocated to a class of shares
will be borne on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis by each outstanding share of that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Class 9 Shares of a Series will be exchangeable only for Class A Shares of the other Series, Class B Shares will be exchangeable
only for Class B Shares of the other Series and Class M Shares of New Cash Fund will have no exchange feature since no other
Series currently offers Class M Shares. The applicable exchange privileges will be in compliance with rule 11a&hyph;3
under the 1940 Act and will be set forth in each Series' prospectus.

Applicants' Legal Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants seek an exemption from sections 18(g), 18(f)(1), and 18(i) of the 1940 Act to the extent the Multi-Class
Plan may result in a senior security, as defined by section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, the issuance and sale of which would
be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the 1940 Act, and to the extent the allocation of voting rights under the Multi-Class
Plan may violate the provisions of section 18(i) of the 1940 Act. Applicants believe that the Multi-Class Plan does
not raise any of the legislative concerns that section 18 of the 1940 Act was designed to ameliorate. The proposal does
not involve borrowing and does not affect the Trust's existing assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement
will not increase the speculative character of the Shares of the Trust since all such Shares will participate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in all of the Trust's income and expenses with the exception of the differing Rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and Differential
Expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants also believe that the Multi-Class Plan will both facilitate the distribution of Shares by the Trust
and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing Shares. Additionally, if the Trust is able
to maintain and expand its number of shareholders through the Multi-Class Plan, it shareholders would benefit to
the extent the Trust's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 operating expenses per share would be decreased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditions of Relief
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the requested relief is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investment of a Series and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of the same Series
will relate solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Series; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result
of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for a distribution fee or a service fee; (c) different Differential Expenses for
each class of shares, which are limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable
to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholders
reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class
of shares; (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses
relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) Trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class
of shares; (d) the related voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting one class of shares (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the adoption, amendment or termination of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in
rule 12b&hyph;1; and (e) different exchange privileges. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically
identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated until approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, will approve the Multi-Class Plan
prior to its implementation by a particular Series. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of the Trust regarding
the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class Plan will
reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed Multi-Class Plan is in the best interests of the Series
and its respective shareholders.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The initial determination of the Differential Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees.
Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Trust to meet the Differential
Expenses shall provide to the Trustees, and the Board shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts
so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the 1940 Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Series for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of
shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, will take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any
potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own
costs will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing
expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the
statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of one class of shares will be used to
support any distribution or servicing fee charged to shareholders of that class of shares. Expenditures not related
to the sale or servicing of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fees charged
to that class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the
review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Dividends paid by a Series with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that each particular class
will bear exclusively its own Differential Expenses and costs and distribution fees associated with any rule 12b&hyph;1
plan relating to a particular class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert, the Independent
Examiner. The Independent Examiner has rendered a report to the Applicants, which has been provided to the staff of
the Commission, stating that the methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and allocations
will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute
Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based
upon this review, will render at least annually a report to the Trust that the calculations and allocations are being
made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the
Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the 1940 Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with
respect to these reports, following request by the Trust, which the Trust agrees to make, will be available for inspection
by the Commission's staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant,
the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator or Associate and Assistant Administrators.
The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``Report on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation,'' and
the ongoing reports will be ``Special Purpose'' reports on the ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation
and Tests of Operating Effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing
standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 210 of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (the Act) (49 U.S.C. app. 2509) required the Secretary of Transportation
to establish standards for annual or more frequent inspection of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), and the retention,
by motor carriers, of the records of such inspections. On December 7, 1988, the FHWA published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 49402) [Docket No. MC&hyph;113] which implemented the statutory requirements by amending part 396, Inspection,
Repair, and Maintenance, of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). That final rule requires that
CMVs operating in interstate commerce be inspected at least once a year. The inspection is to be based on Federal inspection
standards, or a State inspection program determined by the FHWA to be comparable to, or as effective as, the Federal
standards. Accordingly, if the FHWA determines that a State's PI program is comparable to, or as effective as, the
requirements of part 396, then a motor carrier must ensure that any of its CMVs which are required by that State to be
inspected through the State's inspection program are so inspected. If a State does not have such a program, the motor
carrier is responsible for ensuring that its CMVs are inspected using one of the alternatives included in the final
rule.

On March 16, 1989, the FHWA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 11020) [Docket No. MC&hyph;89&hyph;10] which requested States and other interested parties to identify and
provide information on the CMV inspection programs in their States. Upon review of the information submitted, the
FHWA published a list of State inspection programs which were determined to be comparable to the Federal PI requirements
on (December 8, 1989, 54 FR 50726). This initial list included 15 States and the District of Columbia. The list was revised
on September 23, 1991 (56 FR 47983), to include the inspection programs of the Alabama Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)
Board, California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, all of the Canadian Provinces, and the Yukon Territory. On November
27, 1992 (57 FR 56400), the list was revised to include the Wisconsin bus inspection program.

Determination: State of Texas CMV Inspection Program

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 8, 1993, the State of Texas (the State) amended its inspection requirements for CMVs under &sect;23.101
of the Texas Administrative Code. The State requires CMVs which are registered in Texas to be inspected annually.
The State defines a CMV as any self-propelled or towed vehicle (except certain farm vehicles with a gross weight, registered
weight, or gross weight rating of less than 48,000 pounds) used on a public highway to transport passengers or property
when: (1) The vehicle or combination of vehicles has a gross weight, registered weight, or gross weight rating in excess
of 26,000 pounds, (2) the vehicle is designed to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, or (3) the
vehicle is used in the transportation of hazardous materials in a quantity requiring placarding. Upon review of the
material submitted by the State, the FHWA has determined that the Texas CMV inspection program in effect as of January
1, 1994, is comparable to or as effective as the Federal PI requirements. Therefore, motor carriers operating CMVs
(as defined in 49 CFR 390.5) subject to the Texas PI program must use the State's program to satisfy the Federal PI requirements.
Not all CMVs are subject to the Texas program, however. Motor carriers operating vehicles that fall below the threshold
weight for the Texas program, but which meet the FHWA's definition of a CMV may continue to use alternative means to
satisfy the Federal PI requirements (e.g., self-inspection, the use of a commercial garage or similar facility,
or passing a roadside inspection that meets the requirements of 49 CFR 396.17).

The FHWA notes that the State requires that CMVs subject to its program, and inspected prior to January 1, 1994, be inspected
on or before the expiration of the current State inspection certificate or decal but no later than December 31, 1994.
Therefore, CMVs that have Texas inspection certificates or decals issued prior to January 1, 1994, may use the alternative
means provided by &sect;396.17 until the pre-1994 inspection certificate or decal expires, but no later than December
31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that in accepting the State's PI program, the FHWA also accepts the recordkeeping requirements
associated with the inspection program. Texas issues inspection decals for CMVs which pass the State inspection.
The State inspection decal is considered by the FHWA as satisfying the Federal requirement for proof of inspection
on the CMV.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to publish guidelines
for cancellation of bond charges. The guidelines in effect at the time the Act was promulgated were published by Treasury
Decision 89&hyph;48, dated April 14, 1989. This document amends certain portions of the guidelines that have proven
to be inequitable or outdated, provides for new guidelines for cases in which petitions are filed untimely and for
certain violations of regulations that have recently been promulgated, and republishes those guidelines which
have worked successfully. The authority to promulgate these guidelines was delegated to the Commissioner of Customs
by Paragraph 1 of Treasury Department Order No. 165, revised (T.D. 53654). A document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In T.D. 89&hyph;48, dated April 14, 1989, the text of guidelines for cancellation of claims for liquidated damages
in effect at the time of enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act was published. Because of changing
enforcement priorities and the need for more efficient administrative processing, the guidelines require amendment.
Through this document, Customs is publishing those changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
New Sections XI and XII Added To Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The most significant change involves the addition of a new Section XII to the guidelines governing the cancellation
of any claim for liquidated damages in which the petition for relief is filed untimely. Under the provisions of &sect;
172.12(b)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 172.12(b)(1)), a bond principal has 60 days from the date of mailing
of the notice of liability for liquidated damages to file a petition for relief. If the principal does not pay the claim,
arrange to pay the claim or file a petition within the 60-day period, then the surety is notified of the claim. Pursuant
to the provisions of &sect;172.12(b)(2) of the Regulations (19 CFR 172.12(b)(2)), the surety has 60 days after notification
to file a petition for relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of &sect;172.2(a) of the Regulations (19 CFR 172.2(a)), if any party liable for liquidated damages
fails to pay, make arrangements to pay or file a petition for relief, the district director shall promptly refer the
claim to the Department of Justice. If no response is received from both the principal and surety, Customs will issue
bills to both parties, demanding payment of the unpaid claims. Billing is required before referral of the matter to
the Department of Justice for commencement of judicial collection action in the Court of International Trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of &sect;172.23 of the Regulations (19 CFR 172.23), no petition may be entertained after a claim
has been referred to the Department of Justice. In the past, Customs has articulated that, as a matter of policy, no
late petitions would be entertained even if the matter had not yet been referred to the Department of Justice, but the
petitioning period had expired. Under current procedures, if a principal or surety wishes to respond to the claim
after billing has begun but referral has not yet occurred, it may only do so through the submission of an offer in compromise
pursuant to the provisions of title 19, United States Code, section 1617, and section 161.5 of the Customs Regulations
(19 CFR 161.5). Before acceptance of any offer, Customs must seek approval of the Office of General Counsel of the Treasury.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this document, Customs is changing its policy with regard to acceptance of late petitions. Petitions which
are not filed timely will be honored, but mitigation will be less generous than that offered in those situations where
petitions are filed timely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under new guidelines for mitigation to be offered when a petition is filed late, the district director will determine,
based on the record and information submitted in the untimely filed petition, as to appropriate mitigation that would
have been afforded had the petition been filed timely. The district 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
director will then calculate the number of calendar days the petition is late. Weekends and holidays will not be excluded
from the calculation of number of days late. He will then multiply the number of calendar days late by 0.1 percent. A
calculation similar to that used to determine mitigation in late filing of entry summary cases will then be used, as
the mitigation amount will be multiplied by the number of days late times 0.1 percent. A minimum additional payment
of $100 on a late petition mitigation will be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, on November 1, Customs issues a CF&hyph;5955A against a bonded carrier, indicating that the carrier
is liable for liquidated damages of $100,000 for delivering merchandise directly to the consignee in violation of
the provisions of 19 CFR 18.8 and its custodial bond. The petition for relief is due from the bond principal by January
1. A petition is received on January 21, some 20 days late. A review of the petition shows that entry was not made on the
merchandise nor were estimated duties paid by the consignee. Had an entry been filed, duties of $9,900 would have been
paid. The carrier was shown to have had a good record of compliance, militating toward mitigation in the low end of the
$100-$1,000 range for that type of violation. Accordingly, had the petition been filed timely, mitigation to $10,000
($9,900 in an amount equal to approximate lost revenue plus $100) would have been afforded. Insofar as the petition
was 20 days late, the time of lateness (20 days) will be multiplied by 0.1 percent, resulting in a multiplier of 2 percent.
The $10,000 mitigation will be multiplied by 2 percent, resulting in a calculation of $200. The $200 amount is compared
to the minimum charge of $100 for a late petition. Insofar as the computed amount is higher than the minimum amount,
$200 would be added to the mitigation. Mitigation would then be afforded in the amount of $10,200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, under current procedures no petitions are accepted after billing of the principal and surety has commenced.
While we are rescinding that policy through this document, in no case will a petition be accepted after the billing
cycle has ended and the case has been determined by Customs to be eligible to be included in any surety sanctioning action
pursuant to the provisions of &sect;113.38 of the Regulations (19 CFR 113.38).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Inasmuch as both the principal and surety have separate petitioning times, a question arises as to whether the late
charge will apply to a bond principal who fails to file a petition in the time period afforded to him by regulation, but
then files a petition during the time period afforded to surety. Because the principal failed to respond timely during
the time period permitted to him, Customs takes the view that his petition will be considered to be late, even if filed
during the time period afforded to surety, and mitigation will reflect that late filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new Section XI is added to the guidelines to provide cancellation standards involving claims for liquidated damages
assessed against Centralized Examination Station (CES) operators for violations of their custodial bond. A Final
Rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 22, 1993 (58 FR 5596) as Treasury Decision (T.D.) 93&hyph;6, whereby Customs amended the Regulations to
provide for a new part 118 (19 CFR part 118) and other amendments delineating the duties and responsibilities of CES
operators. They are required, pursuant to new section 19 CFR 118.4(g), to maintain a Customs custodial bond in an amount
set by the district director. The terms of the Customs custodial bond are found in &sect;113.63 of the Customs Regulations
(19 CFR 113.63). Under the provisions of new section 19 CFR 151.15(b) (also added by T.D. 93&hyph;6), CES operators
assume liability for merchandise for which they receipt or for which they transport to the CES under their operator's
bond. Many of these violations are similar to those arising from breaches of &sect;113.62(f) of the basic importation
bond which involve failure to deliver to or hold merchandise at the place of examination (current Section X of the Guidelines).
Accordingly, the cancellation standards relating to failure to keep merchandise safe in the CES or failure to deliver
merchandise to the CES will be similar. The explanation of changes to Section X will detail these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CES operator is also responsible, under the provisions of 19 CFR 118.4(h), for the maintenance and retention of
records connected with the operation of the CES. Failing to maintain those records would involve a violation not involving
merchandise and would result in liquidated damages of $1,000 for each day the violation continues. The bond cancellation
standards for these cases will mirror the guidelines used for cancellation of claims incurred by bonded warehouse
operators for violations not involving merchandise. The background information to the changes to Section VII describes
these guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to Section I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section I of the bond cancellation standards includes guidelines for the cancellation of charges for late filing
of entry summaries. The Option 1 immediate payment of a preset mitigated amount in lieu of filing a petition for relief
is an extremely successful procedure and is being retained in late filing of entry summary cases. For those violators
who do not wish to take advantage of the Option 1 mitigated amount, petitioning rights will be protected; however,
under new guidelines, a party who chooses to petition for relief in a late filing case will no longer necessarily be
afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. If the petitioning party fails to show that the violation did not occur or
that it occurred as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no
less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current guidelines, when a petition for relief is filed in a late filing case, a distinction is made between
when the entry summary is late by less than 30 days and when it is late by more than 30 days. Different criteria apply to
the review of those two types of petitions. This distinction has proved to be meaningless. Petitions are generally
filed on the basis that the violation did not occur, or that it occurred as a result of contributory Customs error. In
general, petitions are submitted without regard to whether the entry summary was more or less than 30 days late. Additionally,
the factors delineated in the current guidelines to be considered when the entry summary is more than 30 days late are
not consistent with the Option 1 procedure which does not turn on the intent of the violator, the circumstances causing
the lateness or the past record of the violator. Accordingly, Customs is eliminating the distinction in the guidelines
between cases that are late by more or less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current guidelines note that ordinarily, mitigation granted under Option 2 shall not be in an amount less than
that determined in accordance with Option 1 unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present. It has been Customs
experience that those extraordinary circumstances generally relate to contributory Customs error or inaccurate
detection of the violation. Accordingly, the guidelines are being amended to reflect this fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines do not indicate whether applicable merchandise processing fees, harbor maintenance fees and internal
revenue taxes are included in the term ``withheld duty'' for purposes of mitigation of late filing cases. Questions
have arisen as to the propriety of inclusion of these fees and taxes in the withheld duties upon which mitigation is
based. In our view, the Government is deprived of not only duties but also these fees when an entry summary is filed and
payment of duties and fees is tendered late. Accordingly, the guidelines are amended to provide a definition of ``withheld
duties'' to include any fees and charges that are due and owing at the time of filing of the entry summary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the streamlining of the entry process and the onset of automation, multiple entry summaries are often filed by
Customs brokers either in a combined single statement with a single duty check attached or a single electronic fund
transfer occurring to satisfy the appropriate duties, fees and taxes. (This electronic fund transfer is known as
the Automated Clearing House, or ACH.) On occasion, an entry statement check or an electronic fund transfer will be
filed untimely. Because each individual entry summary on the statement is covered by its own importation bond, when
an untimely filing occurs separate claims for liquidated damages are generated for each entry summary. Multiple
assessments arise stemming from the same incident. Bond cancellation standards call for mitigation of each claim
separately. This could involve mitigation of $100 or $200 per entry summary (depending upon whether Customs must
bill for duties or the duties are paid voluntarily prior to billing) plus the concomitant interest charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multiple liquidated damages assessments arise against numerous bonded parties because of a single error made with
regard to the filing of the statement. An electronic fund transfer that is deficient a small amount of money on a large
payment of duties will result in rejection of an entire statement. In these instances, mitigation based on each individual
bond breach could provide an anomalous result and prove counterproductive to Customs desire to encourage the filing
of statement entries. Accordingly, the bond cancellation guidelines are being amended to permit the district director,
in his or her discretion, to grant extraordinary relief from multiple claims for liquidated damages when a statement
is filed untimely. If it appears from the facts available at the time of the breach that a Customs broker is responsible
for the untimely filing of the statement, the district director is afforded the discretion to mitigate all claims
arising from the breach in the same manner as an Option 1 calculation, except that rather than take a $100 base charge
for each entry in the statement or batch (as the traditional guidelines dictate), one $500 base amount may be taken
in settlement of all claims from the statement or batch. The appropriate interest calculation shall be added to the
$500 base amount to arrive at the final Option 1 figure. If the responsible broker fails to pay such Option 1 mitigation
within the time period prescribed or fails to petition for relief, the mitigation will be withdrawn and liquidated
damages will be issued against all bond principals who have entries included in the statement. Those cases will then
be treated individually within appropriate guidelines. District directors are encouraged to use the $500 guideline
for first-time violators. Use of these guidelines on subsequent violations is at the district directors' discretion.

In Treasury Decision 93&hyph;37, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 28, 1993, (58 FR 30979), Customs amended the provisions of the basic importation and entry bond to provide for
liquidated damages when estimated duties, fees and taxes are paid in an untimely manner, when an estimated duty check
is returned unpaid by a financial institution or when an electronic fund transfer is made without sufficient funds
in the debited account. This claim for liquidated damages is assessed only when the entry documents are filed or electronically
submitted timely, but the estimated duty payment is not timely. A claim for liquidated damages of double the unpaid
estimated duties, fees and taxes is assessed. The new bond cancellation standards are amended to include these violations
in the Option 1 late filing of entry summary guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury Decision 93&hyph;37 also amended the provisions of the international carrier bond to provide for liquidated
damages against international carriers who collect passenger processing fees as required by law, but who fail to
remit those fees to Customs in a timely manner. Under the provisions of &sect;24.22(g) of the Customs Regulations
(19 CFR 24.22(g)), carriers are required to pay passenger processing fees over to Customs no later than 31 days after
the close of the calendar quarter in which they were collected. The failure to remit the collected fees as required
by regulation results in assessment of liquidated damages equal to two times the collected but unremitted fees. The
guidelines for cancellation of claims for late filing of estimated duty payments are amended to include guidelines
for those claims established for late remission of collected passenger processing fees.

Changes to Section II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section II includes the standards for cancellation of claims resulting from breaches of Temporary Importation Bonds
(TIBs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current guidelines, if merchandise is exported or destroyed but not within the bond period, or if it was exported
but not under Customs supervision (if required), or if it was timely exported or destroyed but Customs was not notified
(See C.S.D. 91&hyph;19 for timeliness of notification requirements) so as to cancel the bond, the guidelines call
for cancelling the claim for liquidated damages upon payment of an amount between 1 and 5 percent of the ``bond amount''
but not less than $100. This language has caused some confusion, insofar as the bond amount is often the full amount
of a term bond. The bond amount can far exceed and double the duty or 110 percent of the duty claim that might arise because
of a breach. Accordingly, Customs is amending this guideline by replacing the phrase ``bond amount'' with the term
``the claim.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs has determined that less culpability exists in those cases where the merchandise is exported or destroyed
in a timely fashion and the required proof is filed untimely as opposed to those instances where the merchandise is
exported or destroyed outside the bond period. Therefore, the former claims will continue to be cancelled upon payment
of an amount between 1 and 5 percent of the claim for liquidated damages (usually double or 110 percent of the duties),
but in the latter instances (exportation or destruction outside the bond period), the claims will be cancelled upon
payment of an amount between 5 and 10 percent of the claim, but not less than $200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current guidelines, relief is granted to one times the duty on merchandise which is sold but later exported.
This does not take into account whether merchandise is exported within or outside of the bond period. Customs is amending
the guidelines to grant relief to one times the duty on merchandise which is sold but later exported within the bond
period. For merchandise which is sold but later exported outside the bond period, the claim for liquidated damages
will be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to one and one-half times the duty. No relief shall be granted in these
cases involving liquidated damages of 110 percent of the duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current policy, when Customs wishes to supervise the exportation or destruction of TIB merchandise, the entry
is designated at the time of presentation for Customs supervision of exportation or destruction. If the importer
fails to obtain Customs supervision of exportation or destruction, despite the specific designation by Customs,
he receives the same mitigation as the importer who receives the requisite supervision but does so outside the bond
period. Customs is of the view that, inasmuch as supervision of exportation or destruction is required so infrequently,
the TIB importer who fails to obtain such supervision should receive less generous mitigation. Accordingly, the
guidelines are amended to take an amount between ten and twenty-five percent of the claim amount, but not less than
$500, when supervision is required but not obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TIBs are sometimes taken on goods that are otherwise duty-free. Under the provisions of &sect;10.31(f) of the Customs
Regulations (19 CR 10.31(f)), the district director is empowered to require a bond amount necessary to protect the
revenue. In those instances where a breach occurs regarding otherwise duty-free merchandise, Customs should follow
the appropriate guideline based on the circumstances surrounding the breach, but in no case should Customs cancel
the claim upon payment of an amount less than two times the applicable merchandise processing fee or $100, whichever
is greater.

Changes to Section III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III includes bond cancellation standards for claims which arise from violation of a custodial bond maintained
by a bonded carrier. With the proliferation of overnight courier services, the volume of violations involving misdelivery
of in-bond merchandise has risen. These result in violations of 19 CFR 18.8 and the assessment of claims for liquidated
damages. In many instances, informal entries are filed on the misdelivered merchandise. The claims for liquidated
damages are generally cancelled upon payment of $100, an amount that often exceeds the value of the misdelivered merchandise.
Accordingly, Section III of the Customs Bond Cancellation Standards is amended to provide for cancellation upon
payment of an amount between $50 and $1,000 of any claim for which entry is made and duties, fees and taxes are paid via
the informal entry process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, many times in-bond violations are discovered when carriers come forward and disclose the violations
to Customs. In order to encourage this behavior, new guidelines have been promulgated to permit mitigation to as low
as $25 per entry when the in-bond carrier brings such violations to Customs attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Occasionally, the merchandise which is not properly delivered or is delivered short is, in fact, restricted merchandise.
In those instances, mitigation guidelines based upon a loss of revenue do not take into account the possible inadmissibility
of the merchandise. Accordingly, the guidelines are amended to specifically address these situations. Where the
principal or surety can show that entry was made, duties were paid and the merchandise was found to be admissible, the
claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000, consistent with guidelines for admissible
merchandise; however, in those instances where the bond principal cannot show that entry was made, duties were paid
and the merchandise was found to be admissible, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the duties
plus an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the value of the merchandise, but not less than $250. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the in-bond guidelines are amended to permit use of the Option 1 mitigation procedures when the violation
involves the late delivery of in-bond merchandise or the late delivery of in-bond documents to Customs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to Section IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV of the bond cancellation standards includes guidelines for cancellation of claims arising from failure
to redeliver merchandise to Customs custody. An anomalous situation results under current guidelines for cancellation
of claims for failing to mark merchandise with the country of origin (as required by the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1304)
when the merchandise is not marked and liquidation of the entry has become final, which would preclude Customs from
assessing marking duties. Pursuant to current guidelines, if liquidation is final, thereby barring the assessment
of marking duties, claims are cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to no less than 50 percent of the value. This
places the bond principal whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has become final at a mitigation disadvantage
compared to the bond principal whose entry has not been liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latter principal, if a first-time violator, would receive mitigation to an amount between 10 and 25 percent of
the value of the merchandise, after marking duties have been deposited. This would leave this principal with an ultimate
liability, combining the payment of marking duties and the bond charge cancellation amount, of between 20 and 35 percent
of the value of the shipment. Rather than further penalize the principal whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation
has become final, Customs is amending the guidelines to provide for mitigation to an amount between 20 and 35 percent
of the value of the merchandise for the first-time violator whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has
become final and to an amount between 35 and 60 percent of the value of the merchandise to the subsequent violator whose
entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has become final, thereby barring the assessment of marking duties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines are amended to add a section dealing with cancellation of bond claims that arise from failing to redeliver
merchandise that is marked with a false designation of origin in violation of the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1124 and 1125.
These guidelines, designated as a new paragraph F provide for mitigation less generous than that afforded violations
involving failing to mark merchandise with the country of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines for cancellation of claims for violation of other Customs statutes and regulations permit cancellation
of claims incurred by first-time violators upon payment of an amount between one and five percent of the value of the
merchandise. This guideline does not provide Customs with sufficient mitigation flexibility. Accordingly, Customs
amends the guidelines to permit cancellation of claims incurred by first-time violators upon payment of an amount
between one and fifteen percent of the value of the merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new guideline has been formulated for cases that involve failure to provide a sample to Customs. Under current guidelines,
if an importer fails to provide a sample and liquidated damages result, the importer will receive mitigation in the
one to five percent range because this is considered to be a violation of other Customs statutes or regulations. If
an importer has a violative shipment, and a sample will serve to provide evidence of the shipment's inadmissibility,
the importer could benefit in mitigation from failing to provide that sample.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, if an import specialist requests a sample to determine whether a shipment of merchandise bears a genuine
or counterfeit trademark and the importer provides the sample and a violation is determined to exist, any resultant
claim for liquidated damages would be cancelled using the guidelines for trademark violative goods (generally a
25&hyph;50 percent result). Under current guidelines, by failing to provide a sample, the importer would be granted
relief in the one to five percent range. The guidelines are amended to provide that a claim for liquidated damages for
failure to provide a sample will be cancelled consistent with guidelines in effect for any violation that is suspected
with regard to the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a new guideline is promulgated which will provide that in any case where redelivery or compliance with country
of origin marking occurs, but not in a timely manner (i.e., outside the 30-day redelivery period or any other redelivery
period which may be designated by the district director), the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of $100 or one percent
of the value of the shipment, whichever is higher, but in no case shall the amount exceed $1,000. This guideline will
only be appropriate for compliance that occurs prior to the issuance of the Notice of Claim for Liquidated Damages.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section VI of the bond cancellation guidelines covers Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims Arising From Failure
to Timely File Shipper's Export Declarations (SEDs). The guidelines provide for relief for the first and second violations
incurred by a carrier, but after two violations, no relief is afforded from any claim. These guidelines do not take
into account the fact that most carriers file large numbers of SEDs each year and that three violations may be a very
small number when considering the total number of SEDs filed. Accordingly, Customs is amending the guidelines to
remove the references to first or second violations. All claims will be cancelled upon payment of an amount between
25 and 50 percent of the claim but not less than $100, except that no relief shall be granted from any claims written for
$50 or $100. If this mitigation does not have a deterrent effect upon a chronic violator, then cancellation upon payment
of an amount exceeding 50 percent (or denial of relief) may be warranted. In order to promote administrative efficiency,
the guidelines are also being amended to permit Option 1-type mitigation in failure to file SED cases.

In Treasury Decision 92&hyph;81 (57 FR 37692), Customs published a Final Rule amending the Customs Regulations to
provide for regulations specific to duty-free stores. The bond cancellation standards for violations of warehouse
bond regulations are amended to make clear that they are also applicable to duty-free stores. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current policy, claims for liquidated damages for non-merchandise violations relating to the maintenance
of a bonded warehouse are issued at $1,000 for each day that a violation continues. For example, under the provisions
of &sect;19.12(a)(4) of the Regulations (19 CFR 19.12(a)(4)), a bonded warehouseman is required to update a permit
file folder related to a bonded warehouse entry within two business days after any transaction related to that entry
(generally a withdrawal for consumption) is accomplished. By failing to update within two business days, he is in
breach of his bond. If the violation continues for 100 business days, he will be liable for liquidated damages of $100,000.
This has provided some overly harsh claims for liquidated damages for relatively minor violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this document, Customs amends Section VII of the Customs Bond Cancellation Standards to provide for a limit
of $10,000 on any continuing warehouse bond violation not involving merchandise. The promulgation of this cap on
assessment of the claims will not affect guidelines for cancellation currently in effect, but will serve to eliminate
overly harsh assessments and concomitantly harsh cancellation amounts. The guidelines are also amended to permit
implementation of Option 1 procedures in all warehouse bond cases that involve claims for liquidated damages based
upon defaults not involving merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current guidelines for claims arising from defaults involving merchandise do not accurately reflect commercial
reality. The guidelines include a category of defaults arising from clerical error or mistake, that is a non-negligent,
inadvertent error. Under Customs Directives issued concerning assessment of these claims, district directors
are given broad discretion to issue claims for liquidated damages when breaches are detected. Issuance of claims
for liquidated damages for violations arising from clerical error or mistake, as a matter of policy, is unnecessary
in order to encourage compliance. Accordingly, if a claim for liquidated damages is established and the warehouse
proprietor can show that the claim arose from clerical error or mistake and no loss of revenue occurred, then the claim
will be cancelled without payment. If a loss of revenue occurred, it shall be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
evidence that something other than clerical error or mistake occurred and other sections of the guidelines should
be followed.

The guidelines for cancellation of claims arising from defaults involving merchandise which are based upon negligence
do not distinguish between those violations involving merchandise that do not necessarily involve a threat to the
revenue (i.e., manipulation of merchandise without Customs permit or not in accordance with the activity described
in the permit) and those which do involve a threat to the revenue (i.e., removal of merchandise from the warehouse without
permit, or failure to locate or account for merchandise in the warehouse.) The guidelines are amended to provide for
a revenue-based distinction in violations involving merchandise. Violations involving merchandise which result
from negligence but involve no loss of revenue shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between one and fifteen
percent of the value of the merchandise but not less than $100 nor more than $10,000. No distinction shall be made between
violations involving restricted merchandise and violations involving merchandise which is not restricted; however,
if the violation does involve restricted merchandise, that shall be considered to be an aggravating factor which
will result in less generous mitigation. Violations involving merchandise which result from negligence but involve
a potential loss of revenue shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between one and three times the loss of revenue
on the merchandise which cannot be accounted for, unless that merchandise is restricted, in which case the claim shall
be cancelled upon payment of an amount between three and five times the loss of revenue but in no case less than 10 percent
of the value of such merchandise. If the violation is found to be intentional in nature, then no relief from the claim
shall be granted.

Under Section VIII of the guidelines, a reference is made to cancellation of claims for liquidated damages arising
from violation of airport security regulations as published in &sect;122.14 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 122.14).
In Treasury Decision 90&hyph;82, the provisions of &sect;122.14 were renumbered as 19 CFR 122.181 et. seq. The guidelines
are amended to reflect that change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For violations involving unauthorized entry into a secured area, failure to openly display or possess the identification
card, strip or seal, or failure to surrender identification upon demand by an authorized Customs officer, under current
guidelines a first violation is cancelled upon payment of $200, a second violation is cancelled upon payment of $500
and a third or subsequent violation results in no mitigation. If a bond principal has three employees or contractors
who enter into a secured area without authorization, three violations immediately occur and any benefit given for
a first or second violation dissipates. In order to provide a district director with more administrative discretion,
the first, second and third violation distinctions are being eliminated. The district director will be able to cancel
any claim arising from the violative conduct described above upon payment of an amount between $250 and $500. A district
director will always have the discretion to deny relief in these cases based upon articulable aggravating factors.
Inasmuch as the district director will be afforded the noted discretion, old paragraph F of the guidelines, which
permits greater mitigation to a prior violator who does not incur a violation for six months, is being eliminated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines for airport security violations are also being amended to permit the district director to apply Option
1 mitigation procedures, if the facts of a particular case are undisputed and the circumstances surrounding such
case so warrant.

As with the guidelines relating to the cancellation of claims arising from violation of the warehouse bond, the guidelines

any cap on the assessment of claims for violations which do not involve merchandise. For purposes of liquidated damages
assessment (as opposed to penalties which are assessed under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 81s), as a matter of policy,
the guidelines are amended to provide that claims will not be issued for any continuing violation in an amount that
exceeds $10,000. The promulgation of this cap on assessment of the claims will not affect guidelines for cancellation
currently in effect, but will serve to eliminate overly harsh assessments and concomitantly harsh cancellation
amounts.

As with warehouse bond violations, the current guidelines for claims arising from defaults involving merchandise
do not accurately reflect commercial reality. The guidelines include a category of defaults arising from clerical
error or mistake, that is a non-negligent, inadvertent error. Under Customs Directives governing Foreign Trade
Zones issued concerning assessment of these claims, district directors are given broad discretion to issue claims
when breaches of the bond are detected. Issuance of claims for liquidated damages for violations arising from clerical
error or mistake is not always necessary, as a matter of policy, in order to encourage compliance. Accordingly, if
a claim for liquidated damages is established and the Foreign Trade Zone proprietor can show that the claim arose from
clerical error or mistake and no loss of revenue occurred, then the claim will be cancelled without payment. If a loss

The guidelines for cancellation of claims arising from defaults involving merchandise which are based upon negligence
do not distinguish between those violations involving merchandise that do not necessarily involve a threat to the

without permit, or failure to locate or account for merchandise in the zone). The guidelines are amended to provide
for a revenue-based distinction in violations involving merchandise. Violations involving merchandise which
result from negligence but involve no loss of revenue shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between one and fifteen
percent of the value of the merchandise but not to exceed $10,000. No distinction shall be made between violations
involving restricted merchandise and violations involving merchandise which is not restricted; however, if the
violation does involve restricted merchandise, that shall be considered to be an aggravating factor which will result
in less generous mitigation. Violations involving merchandise which result from negligence but involve a potential
loss of revenue shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between one and three times the loss of revenue on the merchandise
which cannot be accounted for, unless that merchandise is restricted, in which case the claim shall be cancelled upon
payment of an amount between three and five times the loss of revenue, but in no case less than 10 percent of the value
of such merchandise. If the violation is found to be intentional in nature, then no relief from the claim shall be granted.

The current guidelines for cancellation of claims for liquidated damages arising from the failure to hold merchandise
at the place of examination in violation of the provisions of &sect;113.62(f) of the Regulations (19 CFR 113.62(f)),
are based on a standard that involves a determination by the deciding officer of a level of culpability (clerical error,
negligence, intentional violation) of the bond principal. This standard is not followed in the guidelines in use
for other similar misdelivery-type violations. Accordingly, through this document, Customs is abandoning the
standard of finding a level of culpability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to establish a violation under the provisions of 19 CFR 113.62(f), Customs must show that the bond principal
obtained permission from Customs to have his merchandise examined at a place which is not in the charge of a Customs
officer (e.g., his business premises, a Centralized Examination Station) and that the bond principal failed to:
Hold the merchandise at such place until released by Customs; transfer such merchandise to any place directed by Customs;
or keep all seals and cording intact.

Through this document, Customs amends the current guidelines so that when a party fails to hold the merchandise for
examination or fails to transfer the merchandise to another place upon instruction from Customs obtained before
the merchandise was released, the claim will be cancelled upon the following terms: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If either the bond principal or surety files an entry summary and pays estimated duties, taxes and fees, Customs
will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected by
Customs to be restricted or prohibited; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If neither the bond principal nor surety files an entry summary and pays estimated duties, taxes and fees, Customs
will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties, taxes and fees that would have been
due plus an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected by Customs to be restricted or prohibited;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the merchandise not held for examination was suspected of being restricted or prohibited, and the bond principal
files an entry summary, pays estimated duties, taxes and fees and the merchandise was deemed admissible with that
entry summary, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the merchandise not held for examination was suspected of being restricted or prohibited, and the bond principal
does not file an entry summary or pay estimated duties or provide a showing that the merchandise was deemed admissible,
Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties, taxes and fees plus an amount
between 25 and 50 percent of the value of the merchandise, but not less than $250; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the violation is determined to be intentional in nature, no relief will be afforded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a violation which involves the failure to keep any Customs seal or cording intact until the merchandise is examined,
the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $500 if there is no evidence to indicate the merchandise
in the sealed or corded shipment was the subject of tampering. If there is evidence of tampering, the claim shall be
cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the value of any missing merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, an additional sentence shall be added to the guidelines to indicate that when the term ``value'' is used in
any provision of these guidelines it means value as determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a and not domestic value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims for Liquidated Damages for Late Filing of Entry Summary Claims (19 CFR 142.15
and 113.62(b)), Late Payment of Estimated Duties Claims (19 CFR 113.62(a)(1)(i) and 113.62(k)(4)), and Late Remission
of Collected Passenger Processing Fees (19 CFR 113.64(a)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Failure to file entry summaries timely. Pursuant to section 172.22(d) of the Customs Regulations, claims for liquidated
damages for failure to file entry summaries timely shall be issued and mitigated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Notification of liquidated damages incurred; modified CF&hyph;5955A. Notices of liquidated damages incurred
shall be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner
may choose to resolve the demand.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 1.

He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning,
he waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with
the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these
guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petition for relief. Pursuant to the provisions of 19 CFR 172.11, the bond principal or surety may file a petition for
relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount.
The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur or
that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation
did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the
claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Calculation of mitigated amount; entry summary filed late. The amounts to be set forth under Option 1 on the CF 5955A
shall be calculated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Dutiable entry summary filed late. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bond principal or surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $100 plus interest on the withheld duty at the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Failure to Hold or Transfer Merchandise. If the principal seeks and obtains permission from Customs to have merchandise
examined at a place other than at a wharf or other place in the charge of a Customs officer and fails to hold merchandise
at the place of examination or fails to transfer the merchandise to another place upon instruction from Customs obtained
before the merchandise was released, the claim will be cancelled upon the following terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. If either the bond principal or surety files an entry summary and pays estimated duties, taxes and fees on the merchandise,
Customs may cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected
by Customs to be restricted or prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If neither the bond principal nor surety files an entry summary and pays estimated duties, taxes and fees on the merchandise,
Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties that would have been due plus
an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected by Customs to be restricted or prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the merchandise not delivered to or retained at the examination site is restricted or prohibited, and the bond
principal or surety proves that an entry summary was filed, estimated duties, taxes and fees were paid and the merchandise
was deemed admissible with that entry summary, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between
$100 and $1,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the merchandise not delivered to or retained at the examination site is restricted or prohibited, and the bond
principal or surety does not prove that an entry summary was filed, estimated duties were paid or provide a showing
that the merchandise was deemed admissible, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the
estimated duties plus an amount between 15 and 25 percent of the value of the merchandise but not less than $250. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If the violation is determined to be intentional in nature, no relief should be afforded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Failure to Keep Customs Seal or Cording Intact. For a violation which involves the failure to keep any Customs seal
or cording intact until the merchandise is examined, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between
$100 and $500 if there is no evidence to indicate the merchandise in the sealed or corded shipment was tampered with.
If there is evidence of tampering, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the value of any missing
merchandise.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Merchandise not delivered to or retained at a Centralized Examination Station (CES) by the CES operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. If an entry summary is filed on the merchandise and estimated duties, taxes and fees are paid, Customs may cancel
the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000 if the merchandise was not suspected by Customs to be
restricted or prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If an entry summary is not filed or estimated duties, taxes and fees are not paid on the merchandise, Customs will
cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the estimated duties that would have been due plus an amount

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. If the merchandise not delivered to or retained at the CES is restricted or prohibited, and the bond principal or
surety proves that an entry summary was filed, estimated duties, taxes and fees were paid and the merchandise was deemed
admissible with that entry summary, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the merchandise not delivered to or retained at the CES is restricted or prohibited, and the bond principal or
surety does not prove that an entry summary was filed, estimated duties, taxes and fees were paid or provide a showing
that the merchandise was deemed admissible, Customs will cancel the bond claim upon payment of an amount equal to the
estimated duties, taxes and fees plus an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the value of the merchandise, but not less
than $250. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If the violation is determined to be intentional in nature, no relief should be afforded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Failure to maintain records as required by regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. If a Centralized Examination Station operator fails to maintain records as required by Customs, claims for liquidated
damages not involving merchandise shall result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the breach resulted from clerical error, the claim may be cancelled without payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the breach resulted from negligence, the claim may be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $250
per default, depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the breach was intentional, no relief shall be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Aggravating and mitigating factors shall be those enumerated in Section VII of these Standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
XII. Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims When Petitions for Relief Are Filed Untimely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Petitions may be accepted at the discretion of the district director at any time prior to commencement of any sanctioning
action against a bond principal or the issuance of any notice to show cause against a surety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If a petition is received untimely, Customs shall first consider the petition as though it had been filed timely
and shall determine the amount of mitigation that would have been afforded in the case had the petition been filed timely.
For purposes of these guidelines, this determination shall be known as the base amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Once the base amount has been determined, Customs shall calculate the number of calendar days that the petition
is late and charge an additional mitigation amount of 0.1 percent (.001) per day. In no case shall the additional amount
be less than $100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. If the bond principal fails to file a petition during the time period provided by regulation, but then files a petition
during the period in which the surety, by regulation, could file a petition, that petition will be considered as a late
petition. The number of days late shall be calculated from the end of the 60-day petitioning period afforded to the
principal.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
To address the danger of global climate change from emissions of greenhouse gases, on April 21, 1993, President Clinton
announced the nation's commitment to reduce emissions of these gases in the United States to their 1990 level by the
year 2000 and to produce a cost-effective plan to continue the trend of reduced emissions thereafter. On October 19,
1993, the President released the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), which commits the federal government, in partnership
with the private sector, to a broad range of measures in many sectors to meet the target for the year 2000. Studies of
greenhouse gas emission trends leading up to the CCAP confirmed that, particularly in the years after 2000, the personal
transportation sector is expected to be the fastest growing contributor to carbon dioxide emission levels, as a result
of continuing fast growth of vehicle miles travelled and relatively slow improvement in vehicle fuel economy. Although
the CCAP contains several measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, there is a
need for significant cost-effective longer-term efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and
light duty trucks.

The CCAP directed three policy offices in the Executive Office of the President_the Office of Environmental Policy
(OEP), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Economic Council (NEC)_to co-chair a process
to develop policies to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles in the years after
2000. The three offices, in consultation with the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Energy (DOE),
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Council of Economic Advisors (CEA),
have established a process under which a Policy Dialog Advisory Committee, constituted pursuant to the Federal Advisory
Committee Act, will be convened. The Advisory Committee will develop recommendations on the sets of policies that
would, if adopted, most cost-effectively obtain a return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions from personal
motor vehicles by the years 2005, 2015 and 2025, with no upturn thereafter. This framework of achievement of 1990 emissions
levels in three alternative years is designed to focus the issues and the Committee's recommendations. Decisions
on the amount and timing of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, and the policies
to attain them, remain the responsibility of the federal government. However, the Administration has stated that
it is committed to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goal of the Advisory Committee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The goal of the Advisory Committee's deliberations will be to develop a consensus among major stakeholders on the
sets of policies that would, if adopted, most cost-effectively return greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light
trucks to 1990 levels by the years 2005, 2015, and 2025, with no upturn thereafter. (There will be three different sets
of policies, one for each year.) The Advisory Committee process is structured this way to generate maximum consideration
of potential policies, their interactions and trade-offs and to increase the potential to reach consensus. By law,
the Advisory Committee's functions must be purely advisory. Therefore the decisions on the amount and timing of emissions
reductions from personal motor vehicles and the policies to attain them, ultimately remain the responsibility of
the federal government. However, in the CCAP the Administration stated its intention to take action_regulatory,
legislative or otherwise_immediately after the process is completed to begin responding to the problem of increased
greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, with or without consensus among the stakeholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advisory Committee will consider a broad range of policy alternatives, including policies affecting: (i) Demand
for personal vehicle travel, (ii) vehicle and fuel technology changes (including increases in vehicle and fuel system
operating efficiency); and (iii) shifts in consumer choice among vehicle and fuel technology options. Policies
to be considered will focus on those that can be implemented by the federal government, but such policies will be considered
in the context of what can and should be accomplished at the state, local and regional levels, and by private parties,
both consumers and producers. Groups of policies designed to achieve 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in each
of the three targeted years will be evaluated on the basis of costs and projected reductions in metric tons of carbon
equivalents (greenhouse gas emissions). Policy groups will also be evaluated on the basis of the speed, reliability,
sustainability and efficiency of greenhouse gas reductions; the potential impact of options on urban air pollution
and on safety; the cost of alternative policies affecting this sector (including their impact on consumers, jobs,
competitiveness and mobility); improvements in energy security; and the feasibility of adoption and ease of implementation.

Operation of the Advisory Committee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Advisory Committee will be expected to meet approximately eight times over a period of one year. Meetings are expected
to be two days in duration. Although most meetings will be held in Washington, DC, one to two meetings may be held in other
locations to maximize public participation. Meetings will be open to the public. To maximize the opportunities for
participation by those representing the public, the federal government may pay travel expenses, including per diem
in lieu of subsistence, of Advisory Committee members representing not-for-profit entities and state or local governments
who would not otherwise be able to participate. On-line facilities will be used to enhance the operation of the Advisory
Committee, to broaden opportunities for public participation, and to reduce costs. The Advisory Committee and steering
committee will be able to work with an interagency analytical support team led by the CEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advisory Committee will issue an interim report within six months of the date of its first meeting. This report
shall advise the President, through the steering committee, of the Advisory Committee's proceedings. The Committee
shall submit its final report to the President, through the steering committee, within on year of the date of its first
meeting, unless this period is extended by the President.

3. Objectives and Scope of Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Climate Change Action Plan directed the National Economic Council (NEC), the Office of Environmental Policy
(OEP), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to co-chair a process to develop measures to significantly
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, including cars and light trucks. This process, called
the Personal Motor Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Reduction Project, will be directed by a steering committee responsible
for making recommendations to the President at the close of the project. The steering committee will consist of representatives
of the NEC, OEP, OSTP, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Office
of Management and Budget and Council of Economic Advisors. A representative of the Office of the Vice President will
participate in meetings of the steering committee. As set forth in section 4 of this Charter, the Advisory Committee
shall provide to the President, through the steering committee, advice and recommendations concerning cost-effective
groups of policies that would, if adopted, return total greenhouse gas emissions from use of personal motor vehicles
to their 1990 levels by the years 2005, 2015 and 2025 (and then stabilize or continue to reduce such emissions).
