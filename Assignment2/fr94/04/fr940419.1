SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes to amend its Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly
Based on Whistleblowing. This amendment extends the time limit for filing an appeal of an agency action where the appellant
first files a request for a stay of that action. This proposed change will bring the filing time in initial whistleblower
cases into line with filing times in the Board's appellate jurisdiction cases and will also have the effect of making
the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change came about as a result of Executive Order 12866, September 30, 1993, requiring agencies to insure
that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable. The Board's review found that changing
the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent with the legal and regulatory
time limits for filing with the Federal courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission both of which can potentially
review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed change will help to eliminate possible
confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order
12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612).

In its letter of March 14, 1994, to DOE, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers requested postponement of

In its letter of March 16, 1994, to DOE, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association requested postponement of the

that given ``the unexpected severity of DOE's proposed rule, a short interval between publication of the proposed

Many corporate credit unions are closely tied to credit union leagues or trade associations through interlocking
boards of directors or common management. The NCUA Board requests comment on whether to amend its regulations to require
that a corporate credit union's board of directors be independently elected by its members, that the board represent
primarily the interests of those members that are credit unions, and that management report only to the corporate
credit union's board of directors.

A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The corporate credit union system today consists of 44 corporate credit unions serving the nation's 13,000 natural
person credit unions, with U.S. Central Credit Union in turn serving the corporate credit unions. The corporate credit
union system provides liquidity, investment, and payment services to credit unions. As of December 31, 1993, the
44 corporate credit unions held about $41 billion in assets, half of which was reinvested in shares in U.S. Central.
Approximately half of the corporate credit unions are closely tied to state credit union leagues, either through
interlocking boards, management relationships, or both. In the case of U.S. Central, six of nine board seats are allotted
to trade association representatives: three to the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), two to the Association
of Credit Union League Executives, and one to the Kansas Credit Union Association. In addition, U.S. Central's CEO
reports to the CEO of CUNA.

For the reasons discussed below, the NCUA Board is requesting comment on whether a corporate credit union's board
of directors should be independently elected by its members, primarily represent the interests of the corporate's
member credit unions, and have sole authority over the management of the corporate credit union. These and other corporate
credit union issues, including investment powers and capital levels, are currently under review by NCUA as part of
a 180-day study of the corporate system, and the Board may propose specific regulatory changes at the completion of
the study.

B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The history of the ties between corporate credit unions and trade associations is a long and, for the most part, successful
one. It stems from the credit union movement's long struggle for a national solution to its liquidity problems. A review
of these efforts is essential in understanding how the present system, with its unusual combination of private and
government entities, was established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original draft of the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act contained a section for a central bank for credit unions. It
was dropped in exchange for a grant of authority for federal credit unions to make deposits in, and to borrow from, federal
reserve banks. Opposition from the Federal Reserve System led to the striking of this authority. Federal credit unions
were led to believe that, as a compromise, they would be included in the upcoming legislation to create the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When the legislation was adopted, however, credit unions were not included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1940's, credit unions experienced a number of liquidity problems, especially during the war years of 1941&hyph;1945.
In response, the first corporate credit union was organized by credit union leaders in Kansas in 1951. Also in 1951,
the credit union movement secured the introduction of a bill for a national central bank and seven regional banks,
but Congress failed to address the issue. In the late 1950's, several bills were considered by Congress for the chartering
of central credit unions which could accept the deposits of federal credit unions. None of these was adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forced to address liquidity problems on their own, credit union leagues began to establish additional state-chartered
corporate credit unions. League officials lent their expertise in helping to start these corporate credit unions
and serving on their boards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Following severe liquidity problems in 1966 and 1969, the credit union movement again petitioned Congress for a central
bank. Congressman Wright Patman (D&hyph;TX) introduced a bill to create a national credit union bank in 1971, but
did not secure enactment. He tried again in 1973, once more unsuccessfully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Realizing that credit union system liquidity and investment needs would continue to be addressed in the private sector,
CUNA worked to establish a central institution to serve corporate credit unions, securing a charter for U.S. Central
Credit Union from the State of Kansas in 1974. In 1980, legislation was passed enabling U.S. Central and the other corporate
credit unions to be designated as ``bankers banks,'' with access to the Federal Reserve System. By the early 1980's,
most states had established corporate credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The financial reform bills of the early to mid-1970's advanced the concept of a central liquidity facility for credit
unions, rather than a central bank. The credit union movement eventually supported the establishment of such a facility
to serve as a backup for the private system. The Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) was officially established November
1978 and continues in its role of providing a government-operated source of liquidity for the credit union system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The credit union movement must be acknowledged for successfully establishing a private system which has met the liquidity
needs of credit unions and provided services in the areas of investments, securities safekeeping, payment systems,
and correspondent services. This corporate credit union system, while encountering some problems, has nevertheless
done an admirable job of meeting the needs of credit unions over an extended period of time.

C. Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The history of NCUA's regulatory efforts in this area reflects its concern regarding the control and direction of
corporate credit unions. Until 1979, only natural person members of a corporate credit union were permitted to serve
on the board of directors. In 1979 the NCUA Board issued a final rule permitting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
member credit unions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to appoint representatives to the corporate credit union. See 44 FR 58496, Oct. 10, 1979. A representative was empowered
to attend meetings, vote, and stand for election on behalf of the member credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1980 the Board issued Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) 80&hyph;3, which clarified that although

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
other non-natural person members 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of corporate credit unions were entitled to vote through agents, such agents could not stand for election in place
of the non-natural person member and were not eligible to serve in any elective or appointive capacity in the corporate
credit union. 45 FR 14202, Mar. 5, 1980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983 the Board adopted the standard corporate federal credit union (FCU) bylaws. Article XV, Section 2, addresses
conflicts of interest of officials and employees and is identical to Article XIX, Section 4, of the standard FCU bylaws
for natural person FCUs. It provides, in relevant part:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No director, committee member, officer, agent, or employee of this credit union shall in any manner, directly or indirectly,
participate in the deliberation upon or the determination of any question affecting his/her pecuniary interest
or the pecuniary interest of any corporation, partnership, or association (other than this credit union) in which
he/she is directly or indirectly interested.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to concerns about the implications for a corporate credit union official who is the designated representative
of a member credit union acting upon matters which may affect that credit union, the Board noted that the provision
was not intended to preclude an official from participating in the establishment of policy and general direction
of the corporate credit union. The Board stated that it was intended to preclude an official from taking part in actions
which would represent a true conflict of interest in a meaningful sense pertaining to his or her credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984 the Board issued a final rule permitting all non-natural person members of corporate credit unions to designate
representatives to stand for election and hold elective and appointive office. 49 FR 50368, Dec. 28, 1984. In the preamble
to the proposed rule, the Board stated that the restrictions of the regulation and IRPS 80&hyph;3 were at variance
with the underlying philosophy of one-member-one-vote. 49 FR 17953, Apr. 26, 1984. In the preamble to the final rule,
the Board stated that because corporate credit unions must primarily serve other credit unions, the credit union
members would continue to influence the direction, policy, and priorities of the corporates through the democratic
process. The Board also acted to officially repeal IRPS 80&hyph;3, stating that it addressed matters that were either
superseded by or incorporated in the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over time, a limited number of corporate credit unions developed financial problems resulting in part from poor quality,
preferential loans made to affiliated leagues, less than arms-length transactions involving the purchase or lease
of league's fixed assets, and the payment of other league expenses. These incidents occurred in corporates that were
closely tied to leagues at either the board or management level. In response, the NCUA Board issued a proposed rule
in 1991 requiring that at least three members of the corporate credit union board be individuals who were independent
of any organization with which the corporate credit union was associated, excluding member credit unions. See 56
FR 11952, Mar. 21, 1991. The Board noted that many corporate credit unions shared physical space, personnel, and officials
with other organizations, often leagues and service organizations, creating an environment in which conflicts
of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could develop. The proposed rule also contained a recusal
provision identical to Article XV, Section 2, of the standard corporate FCU bylaws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, issued on May 7, 1992, see 57 FR 22626, May 28, 1992, gave corporate credit unions an option with regard
to board representation. Section 704.12(a) states that the board of directors of a corporate credit union is determined
as stipulated in the corporate credit union's bylaws, provided that: (1) At least three directors are not officers,
directors, or employees of an affiliated organization; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) elections are open and independent, with procedures for nominations by petition and mail balloting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed recusal provision was also changed. Section 704.12(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
requires recusal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for matters involving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
personal pecuniary interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For matters involving the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pecuniary interest of an entity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in which an official or employee is interested, Section 704.12(c)(2) requires recusal only when the amount in question
exceeds 5 percent of the corporate credit union's capital, when measured annually as an aggregate of business arrangements
with the entity. The conflict faced by corporate FCUs, between the new recusal provision and the bylaws, was not addressed.

D. Re-examining the System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the new regulations have resulted in greater independence of corporate credit unions, the leagues and trade
associations still wield considerable influence in some institutions. A number of factors have led the Board to consider
whether additional steps should be taken to ensure that boards of directors and management of corporate credit unions
operate independently of credit union trade associations and represent the interests of the corporate's member
credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One important factor is the dramatic increase in the scrutiny of financial institutions by the public, the press,
and Congress as a result of the savings and loan disaster. A primary example of this scrutiny is the exhaustive General
Accounting Office study of credit unions. This 371-page report was the longest and most detailed of any financial
institution sector and was done at a time when the credit union movement was recording record growth, record health,
and was experiencing no identifiable problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This atmosphere of intense scrutiny, while fully understandable, means that measures must be taken to ensure that
safety and soundness, and the perception of safety and soundness, are maintained at the highest possible level. Public
confidence in the financial system is based, after all, more on public perception than on an intimate knowledge of
the workings of the system. The crash of the savings and loan industry and temporary problems at the FDIC have increased
public scrutiny and mistrust of the financial services industry. In this atmosphere, it is essential that credit
union members and the public be assured that corporate credit union decision makers act only with the interests of
the corporate credit union's members in mind.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second factor is a function of credit union growth. The asset level of corporate credit unions is almost as high
as that of the entire credit union movement when the CLF was created. The magnitude of the asset growth within the corporate
system attracts outside attention and warrants continuous re-examination for possible weaknesses and/or areas
of improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, as previously mentioned, the interrelationships between corporate credit unions and state trade associations
have in some cases led to the misuse of corporate credit unions' resources to address budgetary or financial constraints
in the trade associations. The NCUA Board is concerned that such conflicts, or even the appearance of conflicts in
these areas, may threaten the survival of a strong and independent credit union system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the recent publicity concerning U.S. Central's foreign investments has focused considerable attention
to the corporate credit union system. The Board is concerned that if the system is perceived as having areas of potential
conflict, Congress will introduce legislative proposals to address them. As mentioned earlier, the Board has undertaken
a study of the corporate credit union system which should allay these concerns if they are unfounded. If changes are
needed, however, the Board believes it is preferable to address them by regulation, rather than await Congressional
action over which NCUA and credit unions may have little or no control.

E. Request for Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Election of Directors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the above factors, the Board requests comment on changes to NCUA's regulation of corporate credit
unions, 12 CFR Part 704, to require that the board of directors of a corporate credit union be independently elected
by its members, with the condition that at least a majority of the board seats be held by representatives of member credit
unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that in many instances interlocks exists as a result of the same representative(s) being separately
elected to both the corporate credit union board of directors and the board of a league or other association, the NCUA
Board also requests comment on whether it should establish a requirement that all or a majority of the corporate board
be comprised of representatives who do not serve in dual capacities other than as officials of both the corporate and
a member credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests comments on other issues related to how best to accomplish majority representation by credit unions.
For example, elections could be open, with unrestricted nominations. However, once the maximum number of seats permitted
to representatives of non-credit union members was filled, the remaining seats would go to credit union representatives,
even if a non-credit union representative received more votes. As an alternative, the Board could revise the regulations
to revert to the limitations of IRPS 80&hyph;3, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that non-credit union members have full voting rights but are not eligible to hold seats or place representatives
on the board of directors. The Board seeks comments on these and other methods to assure a corporate credit union's
board is representative primarily of the interests of the corporate's member credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is aware that this is a departure from the democratic ideal of equal rights for all members, but believes for
the reasons described above, that it may be in the best interests of credit unions. As the history of part 704 shows,
the rights of various types of corporate credit union members frequently have differed, as the role of corporate credit
unions has evolved over the years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of U.S. Central Credit Union, the Board has some concern that majority representation by its member credit
unions may not be the best solution. While U.S. Central serves other corporate credit unions, it ultimately has great
responsibilities, because of its central and national role, to natural person credit unions and credit union members.
The Board requests comment on whether classes of directors should be established at U.S. Central in order to ensure
representation by natural person credit unions and others broadly representative of the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-natural Person Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also seeks comment on whether election or appointment of a non-natural person member representative to
a position in a corporate credit union should be considered to be an election or appointment of the individual or the
non-natural person member. In IRPS 80&hyph;3 the Board took the position that election or appointment was of the individual,
not the non-natural person member. The Board stated that while the board of directors of a member credit union (at that
time the only non-natural person member permitted to designate a representative to stand for election) was free to
change its designated representative at any time, where that representative had been elected to the corporate credit
union's board of directors or elected or appointed to a committee, revocation of the designation meant that any position
held by that individual must be declared vacant. Such vacancies were to be filled in accordance with the Article VII,
Section 3, of the FCU bylaws (the corporate FCU bylaws had not yet been issued), which provides that vacancies on the
board, credit committee, or supervisory committee shall be filled by vote of a majority of the directors then holding
office. The member credit union's new representative did not automatically assume the old representative's elected
or appointed position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, IRPS 80&hyph;3 was repealed in the 1984 revision to the regulation. However, there was no discussion
of NCUA's position on filling a position when a non-natural person member's designated can no longer serve or the non-natural
person member wishes to change its designate. Subsequently, NCUA informally took the position that it was a matter
to be determined by each corporate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that there are sound arguments for each position. In IRPS 80&hyph;3, it was observed that where the
designated representative of a non-natural member has been elected or appointed to a position in the corporate credit
union, the voters or appointing official were, at least in part, swayed by the qualifications of the individual. It
was reasoned that to permit the board of directors of the non-natural person member to substitute another individual
in the place of a representative who has been elected or appointed to an office defeats the purpose of an election in
the one case and usurps the power of the appointing official in the other. On the other hand, it is the non-natural person
entity that is the actual member of the corporate credit union, not the representative, so it can be argued that it is
the non-natural person member that holds the elected or appointed position. As such the member should have the right
to determine who serves as its representative. The Board seeks comment on whether all corporates should be required
to take the same approach to non-natural person members and which approach is preferable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recusal Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring that a majority of the board of directors of a corporate credit union, but not all, be representatives of
member credit unions means that some board members may be either representatives of other non-natural person members,
such as leagues and service organizations, or natural person members with ties to such entities. Also, depending
on the Board's ultimate decision on the issue, individual representatives of member credit unions may, in some cases,
continue to serve on the corporate board and, at the same time, serve on the board of a league or other association. Finally,
conflicts will continue to arise when matters come before the board of a corporate credit union that directly involve
a member credit union whose representative serves on the board. Accordingly, the NCUA Board believes that to avoid
even the appearance of a conflict of interest, it is important to have a strong recusal provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these concerns, the Board is considering returning to the language of Article XV, Section 2, of the standard
corporate FCU bylaws, which prohibits directors, committee members, officers, agents, or employees of corporate
credit unions from participation in any question affecting the pecuniary interest of any organization in which those
individuals are interested. Adopting this language would resolve the conflict, for corporate FCUs, between the
bylaw and the regulation, and would make the standard uniform for all corporate credit unions. The Board seeks comment
on this idea and on the appropriate definition of ``interested.''

Management Accountability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, as previously mentioned, the NCUA Board is concerned about situations in which management of a corporate
credit union reports to the officials of an affiliated league or trade association. For corporate FCUs, this may violate
several provisions of the standard corporate FCU bylaws. Article VI, Section 5, provides that the board shall have
the general direction and control of the affairs of the credit union. The bylaw states that the board may delegate the
performance of administrative duties but is not relieved of its responsibility for their performance. Article VII,
Section 6, provides that the board may employ a management official who shall not be a member of the board and who shall
be under the direction and control of the board. Although the Board cannot speak to the bylaws of state-chartered corporate
credit unions, the practice of the management of one entity reporting to officials of another entity violates fundamental
principles of general corporate law. Accordingly, the Board is considering amending its regulations to require
that management of a corporate credit union report solely to the board of directors of that credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board welcomes comment on these and any other considerations with respect to the management and control of corporate
credit unions.

F. Effect on State-Chartered Corporate Credit Unions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 704 applies to all federally insured corporate credit unions. Further, non-federally insured corporate credit
union must agree to comply with NCUA's corporate credit union regulation as a condition of receiving funds from natural
person FCUs. Thus, the regulatory changes will affect all corporate credit unions. The Board believes this result
is essential, given that the vast majority of funds held in the corporate system represent investments by federally
insured credit unions.

The Proposal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter VOR Federal
Airways V&hyph;172 and V&hyph;177 located in Wisconsin and Illinois. To expedite the flow of traffic, direct routings
are desirable for aircraft arriving at satellite airports in the Chicago metropolitan area. V&hyph;172 would be
realigned from the newly relocated ELGIN, IL, intersection direct to the Du Page, IL, (DPA) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional
Range/Distance Measuring Equipment facility. V&hyph;177, heading southeast from the Janesville, WI, (JVL) Very
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility toward the Joliet, IL, (JOT) VORTAC
currently doglegs over the Rockford, IL, (RFD) VORTAC. Realigning V&hyph;177 would provide a direct route between
the Janesville and Joliet VORTACs and eliminate the dogleg over the Rockford VORTAC. Domestic VOR Federal airways
are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which
is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airways listed in this document would be
published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to May 4, 1994, the comment period on the notice of proposed rulemaking
pertaining to combinations of over-the-counter (OTC) internal analgesic and antacid ingredients, specifically
sodium bicarbonate used as an antacid active ingredient (February 2, 1994, 59 FR 5068). FDA is taking this action in
response to a request to extend the comment period for an additional 30 days to allow more time to comment on this proposal.
The comment period for these issues closed on April 4, 1994. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products
conducted by FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 2, 1994 (59 FR 5068), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the tentative final monograph
for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (hereinafter referred to as the February
1994, proposal). This proposal affected combinations of internal analgesic and antacid ingredients, specifically
sodium bicarbonate used as an antacid active ingredient. As proposed, combination drug products intended to be dissolved
in liquid prior to administration, such as powders and effervescent granules or tablets, would not be allowed to make
a claim for ``relief of overindulgence in food and drink'' or a claim for ``relief of hangover.'' FDA issued the February
1994, proposal after receiving reports of gastric (stomach) rupture following ingestion of sodium bicarbonate
to relieve gastrointestinal distress. Interested persons were given until April 4, 1994, to submit comments on the
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 28, 1994, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), a trade association representing
the manufacturers and distributors of OTC medicines, requested that the comment period be extended for at least 30
days. NDMA stated that the extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to develop comprehensive comments to
submit to the agency. NDMA explained that most companies that distribute OTC drug products containing sodium bicarbonate
as an active ingredient were not anticipating changes in the internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic
tentative final monograph and the February 1994, proposal provided the first opportunity for many affected parties
to become aware of the agency's concerns and intentions for amending the tentative final monograph. NDMA stated that
interested parties have had insufficient time to acquire the reference materials cited by FDA, to retrieve relevant
product experience reports, and to research thoroughly the issues raised in FDA's February 1994, proposal. NDMA
also mentioned that the time period for the comments includes several days on which many company employees will not
be working because of religious holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has carefully considered the request and believes that this additional time for comment is in the public interest.
Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to May 4, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before May 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products containing sodium bicarbonate
as an antacid active ingredient. Three copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is developing a regulation requiring employers to certify abatement and submit abatement plans and progress
reports as a result of OSHA citations. In addition, OSHA is proposing the placement of a tag on cited equipment to alert
affected employees that a hazardous condition exists while abatement is being accomplished. Violation of the regulation
would result in civil penalties as prescribed by section 17 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. This
notice invites interested parties to submit comments and recommendations on the issues detailed in this document,
as well as other pertinent issues. All the information received in response to this notice will be carefully reviewed.
The comments received will assist OSHA in developing the final regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposed rule is to require employers to inform OSHA and their employees about measures they will
take or have taken in response to OSHA citations, as well as to inform employees about OSHA citations and the alleged
safety or health hazards described therein.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (i.e., ``the Act'' or ``the OSH Act''), 29 U.S.C. 651 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, OSHA inspects workplaces to determine whether employers are complying with OSHA standards and other statutory
or regulatory requirements. If OSHA believes that an employer has committed a violation, a citation is issued. The
citation will reference the requirement allegedly violated, the alleged violation, and note the proposed penalty
and a date by which the violation is to be corrected, i.e., the abatement date. Section 9(a), 29 U.S.C. 658(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the cover letter to the employer which accompanies an OSHA citation states that the employer must notify
the Area Director promptly by letter of abatement of violations. (OSHA Instruction ADM 1&hyph;1.12A CH&hyph;7,
August 3, 1987. ``IMIS FORMS Manual'', Appendix C, page C&hyph;22). No specific regulation, however, authorizes
this notification action. When, therefore, an employer does not provide written verification of abatement, OSHA
may, depending on the circumstances, seek to verify abatement by making further efforts to communicate with the employer
(e.g., by telephone), or by conducting an on-site follow-up inspection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 1991, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report to Congress in which it assessed the adequacy of OSHA's
policies and procedures for determining whether hazards have been abated. The report (GAO/HRD&hyph;91&hyph;35)
(Ex. 1)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 found that these policies and procedures have limitations that impede the Agency's ability to detect employers who
have failed to abate the safety and health hazards for which they have been cited. GAO found that OSHA's policies: (1)
Do not require, but merely request, employers to provide evidence of abatement, and (2) inadequately address confirmation
of hazard abatements found at construction worksites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The GAO report concluded that OSHA would obtain improved evidence of abatement if its regulations required employers
to provide specific documentation that they have abated hazards. The report further concluded that such a requirement
would enhance OSHA's ability to detect noncomplying employers and determine where to conduct follow-up inspections.
Employers also would be more likely to abate hazards because they would have to provide specific evidence of abatement.
Accordingly, GAO recommended that OSHA promulgate a regulation requiring employers to submit detailed evidence
of what corrective actions have been taken to abate hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAO was also concerned about hazard abatement problems in the construction industry due to the mobility of hazardous
equipment. The report's conclusion stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA needs to confirm abatement of construction hazards in such a way that they will not be repeated at subsequent worksites.
OSHA's practice of accepting worksite closing as a form of abatement allows the continuation of procedures and practices
that perpetuate hazardous conditions. Consequently, contractors can continue to use a defective piece of equipment,
untrained employees, or inadequate procedures and processes at subsequent worksites. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA should require contractors to take abatement actions that will correct what caused the hazard rather than just
eliminate the hazard at the inspection site.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis added) (GAO/HRD&hyph;91&hyph;35)

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second GAO recommendation was for OSHA to revise its polices so that (1) citations to employers at construction
worksites require correcting the condition, equipment, or procedure that create the hazard, and (2) employers will
not be able to ``abate'' hazards solely by moving to another location.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not referenced in the GAO report, unsuspecting employees may be exposed to similar hazards under conditions
in which the place of employment and equipment are permanent, but there is a frequent turnover of employees in temporary
jobs or employees are rotated frequently through different job assignments. Also, workers in mobile crews who visit
different job sites should have available hazard warning information regarding defective equipment which they
must operate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current OSHA policy is that written, detailed plans of abatement shall be submitted to the Area Director when citations
are issued alleging (i.e. noise or air contaminant) violations and OSHA orders that engineering or administrative
controls be implemented. In these cases, employers are also asked to submit progress reports, generally every ninety
days, detailing steps taken to achieve complete abatement (e.g., procurement of engineering controls). Field Operations
Manual, chapter V (appendix), E.4.a. and c., E.5.a. and c. (Ex. 2) OSHA's policy, therefore is to have employers verify
that the violation cited has been corrected. Despite this policy, there is no existing regulation, enforceable by
citations and civil penalties, which mandates employers to submit abatement plans, progress reports, or abatement
verification letters. Thus, OSHA proposes that employers should be required by regulation to submit such documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 29 CFR 1903.16 requires the posting of a citation at or near the place of the alleged violation. This regulation
is inadequate in many instances to notify employees that OSHA has required the abatement of hazardous conditions
because citations are often posted on company bulletin boards that employees may not see or read. Employees are more
likely, therefore, to be informed about hazardous equipment they are operating via a required tag affixed to that
equipment than by a posted citation. OSHA already requires that employers in general industry and construction affix
accident-prevention tags informing employees about hazardous conditions. 29 CFR 1910.145(f) and 1926.200(h).
However, these standards do not require employers to state that a condition has been cited. Further, the General Industry
standard does not apply to construction, maritime, or agricultural employers. 29 CFR 1910.145 (f)(1)(ii). Therefore,
OSHA also proposes that all employers covered by the OSH Act be required to affix tags to cited equipment informing
employees about an OSHA citation regarding that equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the proposed rule, there are two key terms, i.e., ``abatement date'' and ``final order.'' The following
discussion is provided in order to relate these terms to the statutory framework created by the OSH Act. The discussion,
however, is general in nature and is not intended to address every situation that may arise in the course of litigation.

Contesting a Citation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, an employer has the right, under the OSH Act, to contest a citation or a prescribed abatement date. (employers
may also contest only the amount of the penalty proposed for a violation, but this action does not delay the abatement
period prescribed for that violation). An abatement date can also be contested by an affected employee or a representative
of affected employees. If neither the employer nor employees contest the citation, the date set forth in the citation
for the correction of the violation is the abatement date.

The Act provides that an employer may file a notice of contest within fifteen working days of receiving the notification
of proposed penalty. Section 10, 29 U.S.C. 659. (Under current OSHA practice, the notification of proposed penalty
is attached to the citation.) Appellate courts have held that OSHA may set an abatement date which falls within the
fifteen-day period, in which case the period allowed for contest is shortened accordingly. See

The Act also provides that, in the event of a contest, the employer's obligation to abate a cited violation is suspended,
provided that the employer's contest has been made ``*&blank;*&blank;* in good faith and not solely for purposes
of delay or avoidance of penalties.'' Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 659(b). Once a citation is contested, an employer's
abatement obligation generally does not start to run until a ``final order'' has been issued ending the administrative
phase of the litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a citation or a prescribed abatement period has been contested, the matter is adjudicated by the Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (i.e., ``the Commission''), an independent agency headed by three Presidential
appointees (i.e., ``Members''). Initially, a contested case is usually heard by an administrative law judge (ALJ)
of the Commission. The ALJ issues a decision and order, which are then docketed with the Commission. This decision
and order may subsequently be reviewed by the full Commission. Section 12(j), 29 U.S.C. 659(j). Under this review
procedure, any Member of the Commission may direct review of the ALJ's decision and order within thirty days of the
docketing date. If there is no direction for review, the ALJ's decision and order becomes the final order of the Commission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any abatement requirement affirmed or modified by an ALJ's decision and order will start to run on the date that the
ALJ's decision and order become a final order. The new abatement date is determined by adding to the final order date
either: (1) The number of days allowed originally for abatement in the citation (in cases where the ALJ affirms the
abatement requirement) or (2) the newly specified period for abatement (in cases where the ALJ modifies the abatement
requirement). If, However, the Commission reviews an ALJ's decision and order, the employer's abatement obligation
remains suspended during the review process. Following its review, the Commission will generally issue its own decision,
which becomes a final order thirty days after its decision is issued. Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C. 659(c).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Again, any abatement period affirmed or modified as a result of the Commission's decision will start to run from the
date its decision becomes a final order.

Prior to issuing its decision, the Commission may sever one or more citation items from the case if it determines that
it will not review the ALJ's affirmance of those items. See Hamilton Die Cast Inc., 12 BNA OSRC 1797 (No. 83&hyph;308,
1986). The order severing citation items will become a final order as to those items.

It is possible that the Commission (or an ALJ) could, in modifying an abatement requirement, state an actual date by
which abatement must be accomplished. In that situation, the abatement date would be the date as specified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ALJ's decision and order that have not been directed for Commission review, or a decision of the Commission following
such review, also may be challenged in the appropriate federal appellate court. Sections 11(a) and (b), 29 U.S.C.
660(a) and (b). Filing a petition for appellate court review does not automatically stay the employer's abatement
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In extraordinary cases, however, either the Commission or the court of appeals may stay the final order at the employer's
request. If stayed, the abatement requirement does not begin to run until the appellate court upholds the earlier
decision of the Commission or the ALJ (i.e., to affirms or revise the abatement requirement) by issuing a mandate or
an equivalent order giving legal effect to the appellate court's decision. Where a citation was vacated by the Commission
or the ALJ, and the appellate court subsequently reverses that decision, the appellate court will generally remand
the case to the Commission for entry of an order to affirm the citation. The abatement requirement then will begin to
run thirty days after the date of the appellate court's order. Should the appellate court, in such cases, not remand
the case for entry of a Commission order, the abatement obligation begins to run from the court's own entry of mandate
or equivalent order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Settlement or withdrawal of a contest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At any stage of an ongoing contest proceeding, there may be a settlement of the case, in whole or in part, or the employer
may unilaterally withdraw the notice of contest, in whole or in part. Under these conditions, the ALJ or the Commission
will enter an order based on the settlement or withdrawal of the notice of contest. It is OSHA's legal position that,
in some circumstances, withdrawal or settlement actions by employers become final orders by operation of law upon
execution, without approval by the Commission. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United Transportation Union, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
474 U.S. 3 (1985)). However, for purposes of determining the timing of an employer's abatement obligations under
the proposed regulation, OSHA has elected to treat orders based on settlement or withdrawal in the same manner as other
ALJ and Commission orders, i.e., the abatement obligation begins to run thirty days after the docketing of the ALJ
order by the Commission or after the issuance of the Commission order, as the case may be. Should the parties phrase
the settlement agreement such that abatement is called for by a date certain, or that the abatement period will run
from a certain event (e.g., the date of execution of the agreement), the abatement date will be determined in accordance
with the terms of the agreement provided no employee or employee representative contests the abatement period specified
in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of a Commission final order has a number of consequences for enforcement. If OSHA determines that an
employer has failed to correct a violation on or before the expiration of the abatement date, OSHA may issue a notification
of failure to abate. Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 659(b). A penalty of up to $7000 may be assessed for each day the failure
to abate continues. Section 17(d), 29 U.S.C. 666(d). If, after a final order, the employer commits a substantially
similar violation in a different location, or with a different piece of equipment, or with the same piece of equipment
after a period of temporary abatement, the violation is classified as repeated and a penalty of up to $70,000 may be
assessed. Section 17 (a), 29 U.S.C. 666(a). Further, the Secretary may file a petition for enforcement of a Commission
order which has became final after a notice of contest, or after a failure to contest within fifteen working days. This
petition is filed in the court of appeals and the court issues a decree enforcing the Commission final order. If the
employer violates this decree, the employer may be subject to penalties for contempt of court. Section 11(b), 29 U.S.C.
660(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion above details the regular procedures for obtaining and enforcing final Commission orders with their
concomitant abatement dates. In addition, there are procedures for modifying the abatement requirements of a citation
due to employer hardship. Upon a showing by an employer of inability to complete abatement within the prescribed period
because of factors beyond the employer's reasonable control, the employer may obtain a modification of the abatement
date. Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C. 659(c). A petition for modification of abatement date (PMA) must be filed no later than
the close of the next working day following the date on which abatement is required. If neither OSHA nor affected employees
object to the employer's request, OSHA may approve the PMA and it then becomes a final order pursuant to section 10(a)
and (c) of the Act. If either OSHA or employees object to the PMA, the case is forwarded to the Commission for adjudication.
See 29 CFR 2200.37. The Commission may either accept, reject, or modify the employer's request for additional time
and issue an appropriate order.

II. Summary and Explanation of the Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulation, an employer who has received an OSHA citation must submit to the OSHA Area Director
an abatement certificate, which states whether or not the violation has been abated, as documentation of abatement.
The proposed regulation would also require an employer who has received an OSHA citation to submit an abatement plan,
where the Area Director requests one by such means as a note on the citation, which sets forth a schedule for the implementation
of abatement measures. Under the proposal the employer would also submit progress reports, which explain what measures
have been taken, if any, in the process of achieving abatement, when the Area Director requires them. The proposed
rule would also require employers to affix tags on equipment noting that a citation has been issued.

Paragraph (a), Scope and Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation applies to all industries covered by the OSH Act, including general industry, construction, maritime,
and agricultural employers. The specific identification of the major industrial groups, in this section, is intended
to make this fact clear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b), Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only those terms of the definitions paragraph which were felt to need further clarification are included in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abatement date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The date by which the employer must abate a violation depends on the stage to which a case has progressed. This definition
sets forth the various ways an abatement date is determined. Circumstance (1) refers to the date actually set forth
in the citation, where the citation item has not been contested. As explained in Section I, this date applies even if
it is with the fifteen-working-day period normally available for the filing of a notice of contest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (2) is self-explanatory, as it refers simply to adding to the final order date either the amount of time
in days initially specified for abatement on the citation or, if that period was modified by the Commission or its judge,
the amount of time so modified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (3) refers to a date for abatement ``expressly set forth'' by the Commission, or a Commission administrative
law judge. The phrase ``expressly set forth'' refers to a date certain or to a set number of days from the final order
date specified date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (4) refers to a date set in a PMA final order. The term (PMA) refers to a petition for modification of the
abatement date described in Section 10(c) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 659(c). A PMA final order results either from OSHA's
approval of an uncontested PMA or the Commission's approval, modification or rejection of the employer's request
for additional time in order to complete abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (5) refers to settlement agreements signed by OSHA and the employer, and, in some cases, employees or
their authorized representatives. As in circumstance(3) the phrase ``expressly set forth'' refers to a date certain
or to a set number of days from the final order date or other specified date.

Abatement plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the definition implies with its reference to ``outlining a schedule for the implementation of measures to achieve
abatement'', an abatement plan required by a citation will specify the requirement for and the frequency of ``progress
reports.'' Generally, abatement plans and progress reports will be associated with multi-step or long-term abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Citation item.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A citation item is a single instance of a violation. For example, a citation may contain ``Item 1'', alleging that the
employer has one machine in violation of 29 CFR 1910.212(a)(1) because it was not guarded. A citation may also list
several violations of the same standard under the same citation item, for example ``Item 1, instance a'', and ``Item
1, instance b''. ``Item 1, Instance a'', and ``Item 1, Instance b'', etc. are all separate ``citation items'' within
the meaning of the proposed regulation. Final order date: The date a citation becomes a final order is the date on which
a citation becomes effective. The major ways a citation can become a final order are detailed in the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category is that of an uncontested citation. If there is no contest by either the employer or the employees,
the citation becomes a final order automatically, fifteen (15) working days after the date the employer receives
the citation and proposed penalty, pursuant to Section 10 of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 659.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second category refers to situations in which there has been a contest either by the employer or by employees, resulting
in the issuance of a decision or order by an ALJ. Under Section 12(j) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect;661(j), a decision
of an ALJ becomes a final order of the Commission thirty days ``after such report'' if no member of the Commission directs
review of the case. Section 12(j) has been construed by the Commission to mean that the thirty-day period runs from
the date on which the decision of the ALJ is docketed by the Commission. (See 29 CFR 2200.90(b)(2);

Robert W. Setterlin &amp; Sons Co., 4 BNA OSHC 1214 (No. 7377, 1976)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third category refers to decisions issued by the Members of the Commission, including orders severing items from
a case. Pursuant to Section 10(c) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect;659(c), such decisions become final orders thirty
days after their issuance, and the filing of petitions for review of these decisions in a court of appeals does not stay
the employer's abatement obligation unless a stay has been expressly ordered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth category addresses the two situations in which the start of an employer's abatement obligation depends
on action by a court. In those cases in which a court of appeals stays an abatement requirement, the abatement requirement
starts when the court issues its mandate or an equivalent order following a decision of the court upholding the Commission's
affirmance of the citation. In those cases where the Commission did not affirm a citation but the court reverses that
decision, the abatement obligation starts upon the court's issuance of its mandate or equivalent order unless the
court remands the case to the Commission for the issuance of an appropriate Commission order. In that situation, the
abatement period starts when the Commission's order becomes final thirty days after its issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

PMA final order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is the order approving, modifying or rejecting the employer's request for additional time to complete the abatement
requirements of the citation.

Paragraph (c), Abatement Certificate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c)(1) specifies the minimum content of the abatement certificate; (c)(2) provides special procedures
for reissuing an abatement certificate for those situations where abatement was not initially completed; and (c)(3)
allows an employer to combine the individual certifications of hazard abatement into one certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4) of the proposed regulation requires the abatement certificate to be accompanied by ``documentary
evidence.'' OSH envisions ``documentary evidence'' to be any type of document which provides evidence that a violative
condition which was cited has, in fact, been abated. The examples of documentary evidence which follow are provided
in order to clarify OSHA's intent and are not to be considered as the only methods which would be acceptable to the Agency,
nor are they automatically accepted in all cases: (1) An invoice or receipt for purchase or disposal of goods and services;
(2) analyses or reports from industrial hygienists, engineers, or other experts indicating the methods by which
the extent to which the hazardous condition has been abated; (3) a manufacturer's recertification for repaired equipment;
(4) contracts and specifications for services; (5) training records, programs, and attendance sheets; (6) in-house
certification; (7) photographic prints depicting the abated condition which have been labeled appropriately with
the citation and item references as they appeared on the citation; and (8) videotape with concise audio and/or visual
identification for the citation reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) of the proposed regulation refers to written abatement plans. OSHA currently requests employers to
submit abatement plans when the Area Director finds them appropriate in connection with safety or health violations.
The proposed regulation would give the Area Director discretion to require abatement plans with respect to either
safety or health violations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e) of the proposal refers to written progress reports. OSHA policy currently provides for progress reports
whenever the Area Director requests them in connection with safety or health violations requiring multi-step or
long term abatement. The proposed regulation would make such progress reports mandatory when required by the Area
Director and indicated on the citation.

Paragraph (f), Tagging of Cited Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f) of the proposed regulation requires the placement of a tag on cited equipment in order to alert employees
who might be exposed to the hazards of that equipment. The tag will state that this equipment has been cited. This procedure
will address the situation, common to the construction industry, in which cited equipment is removed from one worksite
to another where employees are not aware of the hazardous condition. The tag requirements found in this proposed regulation
are intended to provide such employees with knowledge of the violative condition of the equipment. The proposal provides
that these warning tags shall comply with the current OSHA requirements for accident prevention tags (i.e. use, signal
word, and general tag criteria) found in &sect;1910.145(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would require the tag to remain in place on the equipment until the defect has been remedied.
If the equipment is removed from the workplace, sold, or otherwise transferred, it is OSHA's intent that the tag remain
on the equipment. Mere lack of employee exposure to the equipment will not allow the employer to remove the tag.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference to ``tagging equipment'' does not require the tagging of supplies, furnishings, policies, procedures
or building service distribution systems such as for water. However, individual component parts within a distribution
system may be subject to tagging. For example, an unguarded drive shaft on a circulating pump in a water distribution
system found in violation of the machine guarding standard would be considered equipment within the meaning of the
regulation and thus require tagging.

Paragraph (g), Transmittal of Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has included the following note in paragraph (g).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Receipt of an employer's documents by the Agency under this regulation does not constitute an agreement that the employer

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

There are three reasons for this provision. First, although the Agency will try to evaluate submitted material in
a timely fashion, other agency priorities may delay such action. Second, in some cases, the submitted materials may
not accurately or completely describe the abatement. Third, changing working conditions may make the abatement
action described in the materials submitted inaccurate or inadequate.

Paragraph (i), Posting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (i)(5) of the proposed regulation states that the final abatement certificate must remain posted until
abatement has been completed or for six calendar days, whichever is later. Thus, if abatement has been completed,
the certificate shall remain posted for at least six days after completion. If abatement has not been completed, the
abatement certificate initially submitted shall remain posted until the violation has been abated. When abatement
has been accomplished, the new final abatement certificate shall remain posted for six days. If a final abatement
certificate deals with a number of citation items, it shall remain posted for as long as it takes to comply with the posting
requirements for all of the items. OSHA believes that the posting of the abatement certificate will inform employees
whether or not the hazard has been abated and also help to assure the accuracy of the certificate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation is authorized by Sections 8(c)(1), 8(g)(2), and 9(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 657 and 658. Under Section 8(c)(1) ``[e]ach employer shall make, keep and preserve,
and make available to the Secretary or the Secretary of Health [and Human Services] *&blank;*&blank;*, such records
regarding his activities relating to this Act as the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Health [and Human
Services] *&blank;*&blank;*, may prescribe by regulation as necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this
Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses.''
Section 8(g)(2) empowers the Secretary of labor to ``prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary
to carry out [his] responsibilities under this Act.'' Moreover, pursuant to Section 8(c)(1), the Secretary has authority
to issue regulations requiring employers to keep their employees informed of the employers' responsibilities under
the Act. Section 9(b) authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations associated with the posting of citations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary's responsibilities under the Act are defined largely by its enumerated purposes, which
include: Providing for appropriate reporting procedures that will help achieve the objectives of this Act and accurately
describe the nature of the occupational safety and health problem [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(12)]; developing innovative
methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(5)];
and providing an effective enforcement program [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(10)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Secretary asserts that the proposed regulation is necessary and appropriate
to conduct enforcement responsibilities under the Act, to develop information about the prevention of occupational
accidents and illnesses, and to inform employees of their protections and obligations under the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested on all issues involving the proposed regulation. In particular, OSHA requests comment on the
following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What type of documentary evidence should OSHA require employers to submit as proof of final abatement? Should the
type of documentation required to be submitted as proof of final abatement vary according to what is required for abatement,
the type of hazard, or the classification of violation (i.e., willful, repeat, serious, other-than-serious, regulatory)?
What criteria should OSHA apply in judging either the sufficiency or quality of the documentation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What are the costs (time and money) of complying with this new regulation and the basis for estimating these costs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What will be the effects of the requirement that employers post their abatement documents?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. How do the proposed abatement verification procedures differ from current or previous practices of informing
OSHA that abatement has been accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. How much time does each employer currently spend on abatement verification?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. What is the appropriate level of management to sign the abatement verification?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. What are employer experiences with verifying abatement of cited conditions for other Federal and State agencies,
especially State occupational safety and health agencies?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Given the need for evidence of abatement, should an employer be required to submit abatement certification if the
employer has actually abated the condition during the OSHA inspection?

VI. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis for Abatement Verification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introductory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires regulatory agencies to assess the costs and benefits of intended regulations,
to consider the possible alternatives, and to select the most cost-effective form of regulation. The Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to consider
the impact of the regulation on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory impact analysis presents the costs, benefits (cost savings), and economic impact of the proposed
regulation requiring certification of abatement. The impact on small businesses is also presented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has preliminarily concluded that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined
in Executive Order 12866, Section 3, Paragraph (f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation for abatement verification would require employers to notify OSHA Area Directors whether
or not cited violations have been abated. It would require employer to notify OSHA Area Directors whether or not cited
violations have been abated. It would also require employers to offer documentation of abatement plans and progress
reports for multi-step abatement efforts. Based on a survey of OSHA regional offices, OSHA estimates that as many
as 70 percent of cited employers eventually certify and document their abatement actions to some degree at the present
time. This regulatory action will potentially affect all employers covered by the OSH Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action can impose penalties for non-reporting of conditions even if they have been abated and can
also lead to an increase in the penalties that employers face from unabated, violative conditions. Failure to verify
abatement on a timely basis is an additional violation. When abatement is verified by the employer but not actually
performed, criminal penalties for false statement may apply. Increased penalties give employers an incentive both
to abate and to verify abatement, and to do so in a timely manner. Abatement reduces the risk of injury, illness, and
death for employees. The Agency has not estimated the extent of injuries, illnesses, and deaths averted by this regulatory
action, because abatement itself is already required by the OSH Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Certifying Abatement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal OSHA and State-plan agencies performed about 127,000 workplace inspections in 1991, issuing about 413,000
separate (upgrouped) violations (Table 1). Less than 1 percent of the violations were for failure to abate. About
10 percent of all citations were contested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were about 9,000 follow-up inspections by OSHA and State-plan agencies in 1991 that resulted in about 4,300
violations, of which 71 were for failure to abate (Table 2). About 18 percent of all follow-up violations were contested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency estimates that it will take firms, on average, 15 minutes to prepare and mail documentation to certify abatement,
independent of firm size. The Agency estimates that the managers or proprietors who prepare the certification of
abatement earn a total wage of $25 per hour, based on data in the Bureau of Labor Statistics news, June 18, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ceiling, or maximum estimate, of the cost to employers for verifying abatement, including preparation of abatement
certificates and submission of documentation, can be calculated by multiplying the number of violations with the
estimated average time to verify abatement (not the time and cost to comply with the OSHA standard cited) and with the
supervisory wage rate (annual, including benefits), or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
412,707 violations &times; .25 hours per citation &times; $25/hour=
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
=$2.6 million annually.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a large fraction of employers cited for violations now inform OSHA that abatement was performed and sometimes
offer documentation, the new additional cost to employers from this regulation is probably much less than the ceiling
estimate of $2.6 million annually. Other costs, such as for photocopying, photography, or other documenting activity,
are believed to be minimal. The cost of tags for cited equipment is also minor as both the general industry and construction
standards already contain accident prevention tagging requirements (See 1910.145 and 1926.200).

Abatement Plans and Progress Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation allows the Agency's Area Director ``at his or her discretion'' to require an abatement plan
and progress reports when multi-step abatement is ``deemed appropriate.'' At the current time, when the Area Director
issues a citation to an employer (usually involving air contaminants, noise, or ergonomics) which will require a
long, or multi-step, abatement effort, the citation letter lists both the steps to be taken and a schedule for completion.
The Agency in its citation letter informs the employer that it must send progress reports to the Area Director.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the employer will have in hand OSHA's proposed plan for multi-step abatement to use as a guide, the Agency estimates
that it will take an employer two hours to write the plan as required by the proposed regulation. The Agency estimates
that, on average, there are three steps in a multi-step abatement and that it will take the employer 30 minutes to prepare
each progress report. The Agency estimates that the total wage rate of a supervisor, manager, or proprietor who would
perform this work is $25 per hour (Bureau of Labor Statistics News, June 18, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, citations requiring multi-stage abatement efforts are a small percentage of all citations. Virtually
all of the multi-stage abatements for Federal violations are for three causes: Ergonomics, noise, and permissible
air limits. In 1991 there were 749 Federal OSHA inspections that resulted in citations for ergonomics, air contaminants,
noise, or single-substance OSHA standards, resulting in 1,934 violations (all of which would have required multiple
step abatement). Based on this number of multi-stage abatements required in Fiscal year 1991, and assuming that State-plan
agencies had an equal number, the Agency estimates that the cost of proposing multi-step abatement plans and providing
progress reports is:

This regulatory action will reduce time-consuming efforts required of OSHA's enforcement officers to verify and
document abatement in order to close files, thereby increasing the time available for inspection activities. OSHA's
Directorate of Compliance Programs estimates that these efforts consume approximately 5 percent of compliance
staff time, or the equivalent of 50 full-time compliance officers for Federal enforcement. The Agency estimates
that an equal number of full-time equivalents perform this task for State-plan agencies, or a total of 100 full-time-equivalents.
With an average estimated salary of $50,000 including benefits, the dollar value of this time is approximately $5
million annually. The Agency estimates that the increased work of collecting and analyzing abatement certificates
and accompanying documentation for enforcement agencies will be minor_OSHA is currently receiving abatement information
for approximately 70 percent of its citations. The Agency estimates that affected employers should also save approximately
the same amount of time and money ($5 million annually) spent in responding to OSHA's letters and calls seeking verification
of abatement.

Follow-Up Inspections

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1991, Federal OSHA performed about 2,000 follow-up inspections, and State-plan agencies about 7,000 (Table
2), for a total of about 9,000 annually. Combined, these efforts represented 100,700 staff hours,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 or approximately 50 full-time compliance officers. One of the Agency's goals in promulgating this regulation is
to reduce the resources employed in follow-up inspections as well as other unproductive efforts associated with
abatement verification. The Agency's Directorate of Compliance estimates that under this regulation, the Agency
will decrease its follow-up inspections by half, and OSHA estimates that State-plan agencies will do the same. With
an estimated average salary and benefits of $50,000, cutting follow-up inspections by half will save enforcement
agencies $1.25 million in resources annually.

Although a significant portion of a Compliance Officer's time is spent in preparation and travel to a worksite for
these inspections, at the worksite he or she is accompanied by one or more employer representatives as well as an employees
representative. The Agency estimates that: The total hourly wage of the employer's representative is $25; the total
wage of the employee's representative is $15 (BLS News, June 18, 1993); and that a follow-up inspection takes, on average,
three hours. The Agency estimates that reducing the number of follow-up inspections by half will annually save employers
$540,000 [4,500 inspections &times; 3 hrs &times; ($25 + $15)].

D. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency estimates that the economic impact on individual employers, industry profits, and product prices to be
insignificant for every affected industry, and therefore concludes that the regulation is economically feasible.
Only 15 minutes of a manager's time, on average, should be needed to verify abatement and provide some documentation.
Since employers will avoid time spent responding to verification requests from the Agency as well as follow-up inspections,
the Agency estimates that overall there is a net savings for employers. There is a savings of resources for Federal
OSHA and State-plan states. As a whole this regulation should result in a saving of resources (Table 3).

VII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Agency preliminarily certifies that the proposed regulation would not have a significant impact on small businesses
in any industry. As shown in the earlier section on costs of compliance, the cost to individual small establishments
is estimated to be the same as for larger establishments. The costs to establishments in every industry are very low.
In addition, OSHA inspects proportionately more large establishments than small establishments, and the Agency
as a matter of policy does not perform some types of inspections on establishments having ten or fewer employees. The
Agency therefore concludes that this regulation does not place any undue burden on small businesses.

Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR part 1500), and the Department of Labor's
NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). The Agency estimates that the regulation and employers' compliance efforts will
not have any impact on the environment or result in the release of materials that contaminate natural resources or
the environment.

IX. Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987),
regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy
options, consult with States prior to taking any actions which would restrict State policy options, and take such
actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order
provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption
is to be limited to the extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

With respect to States that do not have State plans, the proposed regulation conforms to the preemption provisions
of section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 667) which preempts State promulgation and enforcement of requirements dealing
with occupational safety and health issues covered by Federal OSHA standards unless the State has an OSHA-approved
State plan. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 112 S.Ct. 2374 (1992). Since States without State plans are already prohibited from issuing citations for violations
of requirements covered by Federal OSHA standards, the proposed regulation does not expand this limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency certifies that this proposed regulation has been assessed in accordance with the principles, criteria,
and requirements set forth in sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12612. Section 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act [29 U.S.C.
667(c)(2)] provides that an OSHA-approved State plan must provide for the development and enforcement of safety
and health standards which are, or will be, at least as effective as the Federal program. In implementing this requirement,
29 CFR 1902.3(d)(1) requires a State plan to provide a program for the enforcement of the State standards which is,
or will be, at least as effective as that provided under the OSH Act, and provide assurances that the State-plan enforcement
program will continue to be at least as effective as the Federal program. Furthermore, 29 CFR 1902.4(a) requires State
plans to establish the same procedures and rules as those established by Federal OSHA, or alternative procedures
and rules as effective as the Federal procedures and rules. In particular, a State plan must provide that employees
be informed of their protections and obligations under the Act. 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(iv). It must also provide for
prompt notice to employers and employees when an alleged violation of standards has occurred, including the proposed
abatement requirements, by such means as the issuance and posting of citations. 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(x). Since the
proposed regulation will improve Federal OSHA's effectiveness in enforcing the OSH Act and, in particular, will
foster the abatement of violations and communication to employees about their protections under the Act, State plans
will be required to adopt an identical regulation, or an equivalent regulation that is at least as effective as the
Federal regulation, within six months of Federal promulgation. Thus, the proposed regulation complies with the
Executive Order 12612 with respect to State plan states because (1) it deals with a problem of national scope, and (2)
the OSH Act requires that State-plan states adopt OSHA regulations or equally effective regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered before a final regulation is promulgated.

X. State Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are currently 25 states and other jurisdictions with OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans.
These 25 jurisdictions are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming; and Connecticut and New York (for State and Local government
employees only).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 jurisdictions with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans will be required to adopt
a regulation on abatement verification that is at least as effective as this Federal regulation within six months
of the publication date of this Federal regulation (i.e. six months after the final rule is published).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current State abatement verification-procedures are described in State field operation manuals and/or directives.
Although these State procedures may differ from the Federal procedures, the State-plan states, like OSHA, generally
lack regulations or statutory provisions specifically addressing this issue, with the exception of Wyoming which
does have a regulation requiring abatement verification. Current State abatement verification procedures are
identical to the Federal except as described below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nine States have abatement verification forms: Alaska, California, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon,
South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming. On these forms, the employers describe the specific measures taken to correct
each alleged violation. Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, and Kentucky also ask for documentary evidence.
Alaska requests employers to certify under penalty of perjury that the violations were abated by the dates specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) California and Minnesota ask employers to submit progress reports. California requests monthly progress reports
for all long-term abatements, while Minnesota requests a progress report for all serious and most other violations
of the State's general industry and construction standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For long-term abatements, California requests employers to submit an abatement plan which outlines their procedures
for abatement, such as plans for controls to be installed, and schedules for engineering, purchasing, and installation.
Washington schedules follow-up inspections every six months to check progress made on long-term or multi-step abatement
plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Some States (e.g., South Carolina and California) send a reminder letter to the employer just before the abatement
verification form is due. Washington reminds employers by letter or telephone. Kentucky and California also send
follow-up letters if the form is overdue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maryland tracks informal conference settlements to determine if abatement documentation is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Wyoming has an enforcement regulation requiring the submission of written documents saying when abatement has
been accomplished. Failure to do so can result in a civil penalty. Wyoming can also take legal action to enforce submission
of a letter of abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) New York, which covers only state and local government employees, conducts follow-up inspections to verify abatement
for every violation; employers are not asked to send in any abatement verification information.

This rule proposes to amend the regulation on pension portability under NASA contracts. Questions from NASA personnel
and industry identified a need for consistency regarding the vesting period requirements, flowdown to subcontractors,
and how to determine when pension portability would be appropriate. The rule proposes more consistent treatment
of those issues.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Questions were raised by both industry and within NASA regarding certain aspects of the coverage on pension portability.
The majority of the questions concerned the lack of consistency of NASA's installations regarding the vesting period
requirements and whether the pension portability requirements should apply to subcontracts. The purpose of this
change is to address those issues. The rule also requires the use of the clause at 48 CFR 1852.237&hyph;71 rather than
allowing a clause substantially the same as that one. It also adds a condition for determining when pension portability
would be appropriate. Furthermore, the rule replaces the requirement that a copy of each written determination by
the procurement officer to use pension portability be sent to the Associate Administrator for Procurement with one
that the procurement officer only need keep a record of all such determinations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options)
and, if and when the contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's employees are expected
to remain with the program; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a portable pension plan, a follow-on contract
or a contract consolidating existing services shall include pension portability as long as the total contract period
covered by the plan, past and future, covers five years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only defined contribution plans, or multiparty defined benefit plans operated under a collective bargaining
agreement where the plan follows the employee instead of the employer, shall be permitted in the portability provisions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Vesting shall be 100 percent at the earlier of one year of continuous employee service or contract termination;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is a clear description of the plan, including coverage regarding service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination,
and benefits from prior contracts, as appropriate; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The procurement officer has made a written determination that such a provision is in the Government's best interest,
including the facts supporting that determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all written determinations that the use of pension portability
is in the Government's best interest.

In either case, the plan must be portable, i.e., the plan follows the employee, not the employer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

termination; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Not be modified, terminated, or a new plan adopted without the prior written approval of the cognizant NASA Contracting

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes reclassifying the saltwater crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Australia from endangered to threatened, and the Papua New Guinea population as threatened by reason of similarity
of appearance under the provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The saltwater crocodile has been
listed as endangered throughout its range since 1979, except the Papua New Guinea population, which has never been
listed. A special rule is also proposed that would allow for the importation of certain specimens of saltwater crocodiles
from Australia and Papua New Guinea into the United States in the course of a commercial activity provided that such
import is consistent with the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and certain other provisions. This proposal also reproposes the
special rule for the Nile crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus niloticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and will be consistent with the proposed special rule for the saltwater crocodile. When the Service previously proposed
reclassifying the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened status, the comments received on the proposed special
rule that accompanied that proposed reclassification led the Service to repropose the special rule.

A. Status and Listing History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The saltwater or estuarine crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) ranges from southwest India and along its eastern coast, throughout Southeast Asia and through the Pacific Islands
as far east as Fiji and south to the northern coast of Australia. The majority of populations have been reported from
the following countries: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Australia, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the
Philippines, and Vietnam. It is the largest crocodilian species, reaching lengths well over 20 feet (6.1 meters).
The species inhabits estuaries, mangrove swamps, and tidal reaches of rivers (The World Conservation Union (IUCN)
1975). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the 1979 meeting of the Parties to CITES, the saltwater crocodile was transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I,
except for the population in Papua New Guinea which was retained on Appendix II. On December 16, 1979 (44 FR 75074),
the Service listed all saltwater crocodile populations outside of Papua New Guinea as endangered. Both of these actions
were taken because the species had suffered serious losses of habitat throughout most of its range and it had been subject
to extensive poaching for its hide. At their 1985 meeting, the CITES Parties voted to transfer the Australian population
from Appendix I to Appendix II of CITES pursuant to resolution Conf. 3.15 (ranching) and to transfer the Indonesian
population from Appendix I to Appendix II pursuant to resolution Conf. 5.21, making Indonesia subject to export quotas
approved by the Parties. Under current Australian law, the effect of this action was to allow trade in captive-bred
specimens and specimens taken from approved crocodile farm operations based on controlled collecting of eggs or
hatchlings or nuisance animals from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1990, the Service received a petition from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) requesting
the reclassification of the captive (i.e., captive-bred and ranched) populations of saltwater crocodile in Australia
from endangered to threatened. The petition contained information on the management of wild and captive populations,
population surveys, and legal status. The Service had previously reviewed almost the same information, which was
considered substantial, and the Service was in the process of preparing a proposed rule based on the earlier information
when the petition was received. On September 27, 1990, the Service, acting on this assessment but without issuing
a formal finding, published a proposed rule (55 FR 39489) to reclassify the Australian population of the saltwater
crocodile to threatened status. The proposed rule included a special rule which allowed for the commercial import
of parts and products of ranched saltwater crocodiles from Australia directly into the United States, or through
a third party if that receiving country was a CITES member that filed annual CITES trade reports and any re-exporting
country was also a CITES member. In the absence of a required universal tagging system for crocodilian skins, however,
trade controls were considered insufficient to justify uncontrolled trade through third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publication of the final rule was delayed beyond the 12 months normally allowed because of concerns about allowing
trade in products of one crocodilian species without adequate control of trade in other crocodilians and pending
acceptance of universal tagging procedures for crocodilian skins in international trade. Resolution Conf. 8.14
adopted at the 1992 Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, established a new marking system that
will provide for strict regulation of trade in all crocodilian skins. The new marking program should be in place as
of January 1995.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 27, 1990, (55 FR 39489) the Service announced that available information indicated that both wild and
captive populations of saltwater crocodiles in Australia should be reclassified from endangered to threatened,
and issued a proposed rule to that effect. In that proposal, all interested parties were requested to submit comments
and information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine comments were received: two from ANPWS; one from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO), Division of Wildlife and Ecology; three from the trade industry; and one each from the IUCN
Crocodile Specialist Group for Eastern Asia, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia, and TRAFFIC-USA. All supported
the proposed reclassification, but some had objections to the proposed special rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPWS fully supported the reclassification of the Australian population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Dr. Graeme Caughley, Chief Research Scientist of CSIRO, stated that he saw no reason that ESA and CITES should necessarily
coincide, but in the case of the Australian saltwater crocodile, he favored the controls on trade that were established
under CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Grahame Webb, Vice Chairman for Eastern Asia_Crocodile Specialist Group, supported the proposed changes. He
reported that crocodile populations within Australia are particularly well-managed and that all skins exported
are tagged and clearly identified as having come from Australia. Several crocodile farmers and traders (Crocodile
Farmers Association of Australia, G. Webb Pty. Ltd., and Mainland Holding Pty. Ltd.) all supported the reclassification
of the saltwater crocodile in Australia to threatened status. They stated that the detailed survey work confirming
the expansion of populations and monitoring of habitat justifies this action. The recovery of the population in Australia
since protection and the present management of and research on the species was said to warrant the proposed change
in regulation by the Service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

populations in Australia from endangered to threatened, bringing the designation in line with the current CITES
listing. This was only supported, however, in full recognition of the conservation status (vulnerable) recently
assigned to the species by the IUCN (IUCN 1990). TRAFFIC USA furnished helpful comments on the special rule and the
reporting requirements as called for under Article VIII of CITES.

C. Explanation of Proposed Rule for the Saltwater Crocodile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule, if made final, would revise &sect;17.11(h) to reclassify the Australian population of the saltwater
crocodile from endangered to threatened. Since it is difficult to distinguish between the skins and products derived
from different saltwater crocodile populations, the Service also proposes to revise &sect;17.11(h) to list the
saltwater crocodile population of Papua New Guinea as threatened by similarity of appearance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Australian and Papua New Guinea populations are defined by distinct geo-political boundaries that delineate
an area representing a significant portion of the range of the species. In addition, both populations are biologically
significant in maintaining variability of the species and in preventing the further decline of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the requirements of sections 3(3) and 4(d) of the ESA, this proposed rule also would amend &sect;17.42
by adding a new paragraph to allow for the commercial importation of certain specimens from Australia and Papua New
Guinea into the United States without a threatened species permit but pursuant to CITES trade controls and marking
requirements and certain other specified criteria (provisions of the proposed special rule are described later
in this notice). Under CITES, Australia may export saltwater crocodile skins, meat, or products only if the specimen
is captively bred in a breeding system that is generally maintained without augmentation from the wild, or the specimen
is derived from a crocodile farm operation following CITES ranching provisions and under an approved management
program.

D. Summary of Factors Affecting the Australian Population of Saltwater Crocodile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the ESA (50 CFR part 424) set forth five factors
to be used in determining whether to add, reclassify, or remove a species from the list of endangered and threatened
species. These factors and their applicability to populations of the saltwater crocodile in Australia are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The saltwater crocodile occupies a variety of tidal and non-tidal habitats across northern Australia from Maryborough
on the Queensland east coast to Broome on the Western Australian west coast. The Northern Territory has more extensive
areas of prime saltwater crocodile habitat than either Queensland or Western Australia (report from the Australian
National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) 1990, titled, ``Evidence in Support of a Petition by Australia to the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Remove Captive Populations of the Saltwater Crocodile, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Australia from the Endangered Species List under the U.S. Endangered Species Act 1973''_copy on file with the Office
of Scientific Authority). Exploitation of crocodiles in Australia began on a large scale in the late 1940's and extended
into the early 1970's. During this time, populations in the rivers along the north coast were nearly extirpated with
only small scattered populations remaining (King 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1979). Export of saltwater crocodiles and their parts from Australia was prohibited in 1972. Today, the habitats
are largely intact across the whole of northern Australia, and the species occupies the whole of its known historical
range within the country. The species is protected in the three states where it occurs (the Northern Territory, Queensland,
and Western Australia). Management programs allowing limited utilization of wild stocks for crocodile farm operations
have been implemented by the states in light of the crocodile's increasing population size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the ANPWS (ANPWS 1990, op. cit.), the Northern Territory population of saltwater crocodiles has undergone
significant recovery since protection from hunting in 1972. Analysis of all available monitoring results from 1975
to 1987 shows that the density of wild saltwater crocodiles in tidal rivers has tripled since surveying began. In 1984,
Webb 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1989) estimated the total Northern Territory population of the saltwater crocodile to be at least 40,000 individuals.
Between 1984 and 1987, monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results indicated that the tidal population increased by 16.5 percent. Assuming that this rate of increase can be
applied to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population as a whole, the minimum estimate for 1989 would be 46,000 crocodiles in the Northern Territory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Extensive helicopter surveys across the entire range of habitat types present in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland,
resulted in the sighting of some 2,400 animals. Actual population numbers are likely to be considerably higher. It
is not possible to derive an estimate of absolute numbers for Queensland, but sampling of potentially suitable habitats
yielded an average density index of 0.77 crocodile/km of waterway. Surveys in 1977&hyph;78 resulted in a population
estimate of about 2,000 crocodiles beyond the hatchling stage for Western Australia. The population was estimated
at 2,500 crocodiles beyond the hatchling stage when it was resurveyed in 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Population estimates of saltwater crocodiles in Australia were not made prior to 1970. Over- exploitation for the
skin trade and persecution as undesirable wildlife began in the late 1940's and did not subside until hunting was banned
in 1972. The export of saltwater crocodiles and their parts from Australia was prohibited in 1972 by an amendment of
the customs regulations. By that time, many accessible populations had become seriously threatened with extirpation.
With the enactment of state and territorial protection laws [Wildlife Conservation and Control Ordinance (1962)_Northern
Territories; the Fauna Conservation Act (1974)_Queensland; and the Wildlife Conservation Act (1950)_Western
Australia], the populations showed an immediate response and have tripled in numbers since surveying began in the
late 1970's (ANPWS 1990, op. cit) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the 1985 meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES, the Australian saltwater crocodile population was transferred
from Appendix I to Appendix II, pursuant to resolution Conf. 3.15 on ranching. This provides for trade in saltwater
crocodiles bred in captivity or raised on farms under approved management plans. The transfer was recommended by
the Australian Council of Nature Conservation Ministers and IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group. The Australian CITES
proposal to transfer the Australian population of saltwater crocodile to Appendix II to allow trade under the ranching
provision was based on a series of experimental egg harvests and quantification of the impacts of those harvests.
No discernible impact of this egg harvest has been detected on the number of crocodiles in subsequent age classes.
Australia allows a regulated annual harvest of crocodile eggs for farm operations under approved management plans.
The effects of the egg harvests are quantified and assessed through monitoring programs in the harvested areas. Approval
to harvest eggs incorporates a commitment that if any decline in the wild population were to occur, a larger number
of 1-year old crocodiles would be returned to the wild than would have survived had no eggs or hatchlings been removed
from the wild. At the present time, only the Northern Territory and Western Australia have approved management plans
under which the harvest of eggs is allowed for ranching operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to information provided by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS 1990, op. cit.),
the capture and relocation of nuisance crocodiles can only be authorized by State government personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Northern Territories, nuisance animals are caught alive and relocated to farms whenever practical. In other
cases, they are destroyed by Northern Territory Conservation Commission personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Western Australia, problem crocodiles are captured and removed, or where the level of risk to humans is unacceptable,
permission to kill the crocodile may be given. In both States, those problem animals relocated to farms are individually
marked and, if not required for captive breeding, are available for harvest after they have been maintained in captivity
for a minimum of 30 days. In Queensland, crocodiles may be removed to provide breeding stock for closed-cycle farms.
Nuisance animals may be removed to provide breeding stock or destroyed where other options are not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditional harvest of crocodiles and crocodile eggs for food by Aborigines of the Northern Territory is allowed.
However, the low level of traditional harvests is not considered a threat to the populations. Traditional use does
not include commercial trade.

Ranched and captive-bred crocodile parts and products are exported from three establishments under an approved

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The saltwater crocodile is recognized as a valuable resource in Australia, where laws and regulations are in place
to prevent over- exploitation of these animals. Since the ban on hunting in 1972, saltwater crocodile populations
have substantially increased in numbers. State wildlife laws govern the take, possession, and trade in saltwater
crocodiles. Also, the Commonwealth Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act of 1982, administered
by the ANPWS, helps to protect wildlife that might otherwise be threatened by unregulated export. Under this Act,
export of saltwater crocodiles, their parts and products requires an export permit. Permits may be issued only for
scientific purposes, or for specimens derived from captive-bred animals, or animals taken under an approved management
program. Maximum penalties for violations of the Act are a AUS$100,000 fine and/or 5 years imprisonment for individuals,
and AUS$200,000 for corporations. The substantial increase in maximum penalties for attempting to illegally export
saltwater crocodile skins from Australia (from $1,000 up to $200,000) is considered to be an effective deterrent.
In addition to legislation and policies regulating take within Australia, export of saltwater crocodiles is regulated
by CITES, to which Australia is a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation of take has been a factor in the continued improvement of Australia's saltwater crocodile populations
in the wild. This significant improvement has prompted the Service to propose reclassification of the saltwater
crocodile in Australia from endangered to threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive system of nature conservation reserves has been developed, so that approximately 40 million hectares
of all habitats throughout Australia, or 5.5 percent of the total land surface, is reserved under different categories.
Parks, reserves, and sanctuaries in Northern Australia provide a mosaic of areas in which crocodiles and their habitats
are protected. Significant areas of crocodile habitat are contained in at least six parks or nature reserves. In addition,
nearly 37 million hectares are protected under various state and national marine and estuarine protected area categories.
The Cobourg Peninsula Marine National Park was declared in 1983 to protect, among other species, the saltwater crocodile.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best biological and commercial information with respect to past, present,
and future threats faced by the species in issuing this proposed rule. Criteria for reclassification of a threatened
or endangered species (50 CFR 424.11 (c) and (d)) are the same as for listing a species as endangered or threatened.
The proposed action is to reclassify Australia's saltwater crocodile populations from endangered to threatened,
based on continuing recovery of the species. A special rule amending 50 CFR 17.42 to allow for the importation of specimens
into the United States without a threatened species permit is also proposed. This proposed rule is based on substantial
evidence that Australia's populations of the saltwater crocodile have made a remarkable recovery and are no longer
in imminent danger of extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveys conducted in the late 1980's indicated populations of at least 50,000. Populations are estimated to have
increased three-fold between 1975 and 1987. The species is protected in the three jurisdictions in which it occurs
and there are closely regulated crocodile farm operations. In light of increasing populations, Australia's strict
regulation of harvest, and the requirement of a management program prior to approval of crocodile farm operations,
several threats to the existence of the saltwater crocodile in Australia have been ameliorated. Therefore, the Service
believes that reclassification to threatened best fits the current status of saltwater crocodile populations in
Australia.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other populations throughout the species' range are still in danger of extinction, to varying degrees, by taking.
Penalties for illegal exports and enforcement activities will help ensure that illegal skins or products do not enter
into commercial trade. Because crocodiles of the Australian population cannot be distinguished from saltwater
crocodiles of other populations and from other endangered crocodilians once made into manufactured products, the
Service is proposing a special rule to strengthen the implementation of the CITES skin-tagging program (see description
presented later in this notice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reclassification to a threatened status and adoption of a special rule allowing commercial trade under
certain conditions would not end trade controls for the species. The species remains on Appendix II of CITES with export
permits required, and the special rule would require adherence to the CITES marking scheme for crocodilian skins,
among other things discussed later in this document when provisions of the special rule are described. Trade in legally
harvested saltwater crocodile skins, meat, and products, when controlled as specified in the special rule, will
provide an incentive for conserving the species without posing significant risks to wild populations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Papua New Guinea population of the saltwater crocodile is not listed at present under the ESA. In determining whether
to treat a species as endangered or threatened due to similarity of appearance, the Director must consider the criteria
in section 4(e) of the ESA. Section 4(e) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1534(e)) and 50 CFR 17.50(b) set forth three criteria in
determining whether to list a species for reasons of similarity of appearance. These factors and their applicability
to populations of the saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea are as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The different populations of saltwater crocodile are morphologically indistinguishable. It is impossible to distinguish
the different geographical populations as live animals, skins or finished products. Thus, Papua New Guinea saltwater
crocodiles, their parts and products cannot be distinguished as to origin by law enforcement personnel.

The additional threat posed to the endangered or threatened species by loss of control occasioned by similarity of
appearance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary threat to other saltwater crocodile populations is the difficulty of identifying skins and products
by geographic region as discussed above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The probability that so designating a similar species will substantially facilitate enforcement and further the
purposes and policy of the ESA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The populations of saltwater crocodiles in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea are listed on CITES Appendix
II and are traded in international commerce. The Indonesian population, although listed as endangered by the United
States, is traded among other CITES parties subject to a CITES export quota. International protection has not resulted
in complete cessation of illegal trade in other populations. Only specimens and parts and products from Papua New
Guinea (and under this proposal, from Australia) may be imported into the United States. Designation of the Papua
New Guinea population as threatened by similarity of appearance will help the United States to control illegal trade
of other protected saltwater crocodile populations. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing crocodiles from the
Papua New Guinea population from other populations of saltwater crocodiles and from other endangered crocodilians
once made into manufactured products, the Service is proposing rules to strengthen the implementation of the new
CITES skin tagging program (see description presented later in this notice).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, the Nile crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus niloticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was widespread throughout Africa and Middle East as far north as Syria. Presently, it is confined chiefly to the upstream
regions of the Nile River, tropical and southern Africa, and Madagascar. The Nile crocodile was listed as endangered
in 1970 (35 FR 8495) and on Appendix I of the CITES in 1975 (when CITES came into force) because of the widespread decline
of the species. Since that time, a number of African countries have recognized the value of the Nile crocodile for its
ecological role and as a source of sustainable economic benefit under proper management, especially through ranching
for a controlled harvest of skins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the countries that have started ranching operations, Zimbabwe appears to have the best information on wild crocodile
populations. Improvements in the status of Nile crocodile populations and their management have prompted the CITES
Parties to transfer 11 national populations to Appendix II, allowing commercial trade either under provisions of
the ranching resolutions Conf. 3.15 and 8.22 or subject to export quotas established by agreement of the Parties as
per resolutions Conf. 5.21, 6.17, and 7.14. Populations in Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe have been transferred to Appendix II based on ranching provisions, while populations in Madagascar,
South Africa, and Uganda are permitted under CITES approved export quotas. However, commercial trade is not allowed
from the remaining Nile crocodile range countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 34095), the Service proposed reclassifying the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened status with a
special rule allowing for commercial importation of skins and finished products thereof. Two organizations, the
IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group, and SAVE African Endangered Wildlife Foundation supported the reclassification
of the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened. The ANPWS, the Crocodile Farmers Association of Zimbabwe (CFAZ)
and TRAFFIC USA also supported the reclassification but expressed concern about a provision of the proposed special
rule. Therefore, the Service proceeded to downlist the Nile crocodile to threatened status on September 23, 1993,
(58 FR 49870) but without any change in the special rule, which presently applies only to Zimbabwe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ANPWS, CFAZ, and TRAFFIC USA especially objected to the proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of &sect;17.42 that would
require crocodile skin products to either be tagged or to be accompanied by CITES documents containing the same information
as is on the tags for the crocodiles from which the manufactured products were obtained. ANPWS stated that the control
of skins removes the need to require every manufactured product to be marked, and also indicated that since Australian
skins used in product production in Australia are not tagged it would not be possible to record the tag numbers of these
products on the CITES permits. CFAZ raised the same concerns as ANPWS. It also expressed the concern that the requirements
of this paragraph were unenforceable and urged that it be deleted. TRAFFIC USA also supported the reclassification
but expressed the belief that proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) is impractical and unenforceable. It noted that
``because of the complexities of the crocodilian product manufacturing industry, and the regular movement of skins,
skin parts, and product parts between manufacturers, this requirement. .&blank;.&blank;. will be impossible to
meet.'' Furthermore, TRAFFIC USA expressed support for establishing ``a water-tight system of controlling trade
in the raw material.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes the concerns presented by ANPWS, CFAZ, and TRAFFIC USA, and agrees with TRAFFIC USA in seeking
to strengthen the control in the trade in whole and partial skins. Therefore, the Service is proposing in this notice
a revised special rule that would replace the present &sect;17.42(c) and that is significantly different from the
proposed special rule accompanying the proposed rule to reclassify the Nile crocodile. The presently proposed special
rule removes the requirement to keep track of each CITES crocodilian skin tag number through the product manufacturing
process and to record the CITES tag numbers on the export permits issued for crocodilian products, but adds provisions
designed to supplement the provisions of the universal tagging system being implemented by the CITES Parties. A discussion
of the special rule and of the CITES tagging resolution is presented in a later paragraph on ``Description of Proposed
Special Rule.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to foreign species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA include recognition,
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing
encourages and results in conservation actions by governments, private agencies and groups, and individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the ESA, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions that are to be conducted within
the United States or on the high seas, with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened
and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency
cooperation provision of the ESA are codified at 50 CFR part 402.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, as amended, requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund,
or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a proposed Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must
enter into formal consultation with the Service. With respect to the Nile crocodile or to the saltwater crocodile
in Australia, no Federal activities are known that would require conferral or consultation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, sections 4(d) and 9 of the ESA and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 (which incorporate certain
provisions of 50 CFR 17.21) set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that generally apply to all threatened
wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
to take, import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale
in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,
or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service, the National
Marine Fisheries Service, and State conservation agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving threatened wildlife species
under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.32. With regard to threatened
wildlife, a permit may be issued for the following purposes: scientific, enhancement of propagation or survival,
economic hardship, zoological exhibition or educational purposes, incidental taking, or special purposes consistent
with the ESA. All such permits must also be consistent with the purposes and policy of the ESA as required by section
10(d). Such a permit shall be governed by the provisions of &sect;17.32 unless a special rule applicable to the wildlife
(appearing in &sect;&sect;17.40 to 17.48) provides otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although threatened species are generally covered by all prohibitions applicable to endangered species, under
section 4(d) of the ESA, the Secretary may propose special rules if deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the
conservation of the species. The rule proposed to be included in &sect;17.42 would allow commercial importation
into the United States of certain farm-raised specimens of Australia's saltwater crocodile population, specimens
of this species from Papua New Guinea, and certain specimens of Nile crocodile populations downlisted to Appendix
II by CITES Parties under ranching or quota provisions as provided for by CITES.

D. Description of Proposed Special Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States would allow import only of those specimens or parts or products authorized to be exported under CITES.
In addition, the proposed special rule would not allow trade in such species with countries that are not parties to
CITES, that have taken reservations for crocodilian species under CITES, that do not make required annual reports
to the CITES Secretariat, that have failed to designate Management Authority(s) and Scientific Authorities, or
that do not adequately control illegal trade in crocodilian species. Importation of parts of saltwater crocodiles
directly from Australia or Papua New Guinea, or parts of Nile crocodiles directly from countries with Appendix II
populations would also be allowed under certain circumstances, if the country of origin implements provisions of
the universal tagging system.

Marking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
International trade in certain crocodilians has presented significant problems for the Parties; several resolutions
have been adopted at previous meetings of the Parties in an effort to establish management regimes to benefit the conservation
of the species. The United States, in conjunction with Australia, Italy, and Germany submitted a resolution to the
CITES Secretariat that was adopted at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan (March 2&hyph;13,
1992). This resolution (Conf. 8.14) calls for a universal tagging system for the identification of crocodilian skins
in international trade. Furthermore, in accordance with resolution Conf. 8.14, the Animals Committee at its July
1992 and September 1993 meetings adopted resolutions recommending additional practices for tracking and monitoring
tags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aspects of this resolution dealing with imports into the United States are incorporated into this proposed rule,
and U.S. implementation of this resolution for import, export, and re-export for all crocodilian species will be
incorporated into a future revision of 50 CFR part 23. Adherence to the new marking requirements should reduce the
potential for substitution of illegal skins and reduce the trade control problems with the similarity in appearance
of skins and products among different species of crocodilians.

Prior to implementation of Conf. 8.14. certain taxa listed in Appendix II could be traded internationally without
qualification or assurance of their identification. The CITES resolution on the universal tagging system for the
identification of crocodilian skins (Conf. 8.14) requires, in part: (1) The universal tagging of raw and processed
crocodilian skins with non-reusable tags for all crocodilian skins entering trade or being re-exported, unless
substantial processing and manufacturing has taken place;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That such non-reusable tags include as a minimum the International Organization for Standardization two-letter
code for the country of origin, a unique serial identification number, a species code and the year of production, and
further that such non-reusable tags have as a minimum the following characteristics: a self-locking system, heat
resistance, inertia to chemical and mechanical processing, information that has been applied by permanent stamping
[These requirements have been further specified by the CITES Animals Committee and, as a result, the Secretariat
has identified manufacturers in three countries that are producing CITES-acceptable tags] and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the same information as is on the tags [for whole skins, flanks, bellies, and ``chalecos''] be given on the
export permit, re-export certificate or other Convention document, or on a separate sheet which shall be considered
an integral part of the permit, certificate or document and which should be validated by the same issuing authority;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That each Party in which tags are applied maintain records accounting for tags issued and maintain records that
relate each Convention document number to the tags of the crocodilian specimens traded thereunder and vice versa,
and include this information in its annual report; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) That Parties establish, where legally possible, a system of registration or licensing, or both, for importers
and exporters of crocodilian skins and parts thereof.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule allows trade through intermediary countries, i.e., all countries of re-export by definition,
for Nile and saltwater crocodiles as long as such countries are effectively implementing CITES and they have adopted
certain management measures to control trade in crocodilian skins and products. Countries are not considered as
countries of re-export if the specimen remains in customs control while transiting or being transshipped through
the country and provided those specimens have not entered into the commerce of that country. The special rule is intended
to complement and strengthen the universal crocodilian tagging system as presently envisioned in CITES resolution
Conf. 8.14 and the implementing resolutions prepared by the CITES Animals Committee. These measures include effective
inspection of shipments to determine if the CITES country-of-origin tag is intact for skin imports and exports and
implementing a monitoring system that relates goods produced to tagged skins received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this special rule is to address the monitoring measures in the countries of re-export in order to have
a more accountable system for the transfer and processing of skins and products in the commercial crocodilian trade.
The United States is a major importer of crocodilian products produced by countries of re-export. The Service inspections
of importations have revealed a continuing pattern of commingling and misidentification of crocodilian leathers.
Accompanying CITES documents have often declared the merchandise as American alligator when the product contains
some species of crocodile, or as crocodile, when the goods are made from American alligator hide. The new CITES tagging
system will represent a significant step towards eliminating misidentification of skins as they leave the country
of origin. Since all American alligator skins are tagged upon export from the country of origin, the problems of commingling
of alligator and crocodile clearly arise during the tanning and manufacturing process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there are several species of crocodiles throughout Africa and Asia that remain listed as endangered.
While identification of crocodile versus alligator can be made consistently in manufactured products, species
identification of crocodile products is more difficult. Despite these difficulties, various species of endangered
crocodilians have been identified in products declared as American alligator or non-endangered crocodiles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This special rule is proposed with the goal of ensuring adequate control in the manufacturing countries to deter intermingling
of the protected populations of the Nile and saltwater crocodiles, as well as the endangered populations of other
crocodiles and alligators without imposing the overburdensome requirement of tracking each piece through the production
process, and recording all incoming tag numbers on the re-exporting permit for products. The new CITES tagging system
does not require that country of origin tags remain intact up to the point of manufacture. Since the commingling problems
described above principally arise in the re-exporting countries, the special rule is designed to address these problems,
to fulfill the ESA's criteria for the protection of threatened species and those with similar appearance, and to allow
trade within the parameters outlined below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed special rule requires that a system for monitoring skins be implemented by the countries of re-export,
so that the transaction history is provided, that inventory controls are maintained by the manufacturer, and that
unmarked skins in re-exporting countries will not be allowed in trade after a specific period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, this special rule is written to allow the Service to respond quickly to changing situations that result
in lessened protection to the crocodilians. Thus, the criteria described in the special rule establish non-discretionary
bases for determining whether CITES provisions are being effectively implemented. Therefore, imports into the
United States can be prohibited after publication of a notice of information on any country that fails to comply with
the requirements of the special rule. For those additional situations outside of the ones set forth in the special
rule, which involve a judgment as to whether necessary trade controls are being implemented, the Service will go through
a separate proposed rule and comment process before reaching a final decision on any trade bans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate rule-making proposal, the Service will propose implementation of the CITES tagging system for all crocodilians.
The rule proposed here will adopt the CITES-approved tags as the required tag for all saltwater and Nile crocodile
skins or partial skins being imported into or exported from any re-exporting country if the skin is eventually imported
into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is designed to allow trade in saltwater and Nile crocodile skins and products from designated populations
without the need to obtain a threatened species import permit. Tagged skins may be imported from the country of origin
or any CITES-member country of re-export as long as the involved countries comply with certain criteria. Crocodilian
products may be imported without individual tags, provided the involved countries comply with criteria described
for products. The proposed rule provides several criteria for ensuring that countries of origin and re-export have
implemented controls to monitor transactions in crocodilian skins and products and have a satisfactory enforcement
and CITES implementation history. If a country fails to meet the criteria in the proposed rule, notice to that effect
will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and skins and products from Nile and saltwater crocodiles will not be able to be imported into the United States without
the threatened species import permits required in Part 17.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section-by-Section Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule at &sect;17.42(c)(1) contains definitions of ``crocodilian skin'' and ``crocodilian product.''
A ``crocodilian product'' is an item that is fully manufactured and ready for retail sale without further processing.
A ``crocodilian skin'' is any whole or partial skin, and thus includes skins that have been salted, crusted, tanned
or partially tanned or otherwise processed, e.g., dyed, shaved, polished, or filled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(2) stipulates those ESA prohibitions that apply to the saltwater crocodile from Australia and
Papua New Guinea and the Nile crocodile. All ESA prohibitions apply to other saltwater crocodile populations. In
addition, primarily commercial trade is prohibited for specimens from those saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile
populations listed in CITES Appendix I, and non-commercial imports or exports of specimens from Appendix I populations
require a CITES permit issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3) describes exceptions to prohibitions stipulated in &sect;17.42(c)(2); specifically subparagraphs
(i) and (ii) describe the exceptions for skins and products, respectively, provided the country of origin and all
countries of re-export are in compliance with the criteria described in subparagraph (iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(A) provides that each crocodilian skin bear an intact, uncut tag from the country of origin,
with the CITES-required number in compliance with 50 CFR part 23. When chalecos are traded, the two halves of any individual
chaleco shall be tagged so that if the halves are separated each half bears a tag. Skins may be cut in the country of origin
(for instance into flanks or tail and body pieces) but each piece must be separately tagged when it leaves the country
of origin. Since it is impossible for skins currently present in re-exporting countries to be tagged by their country
of origin, the special rule provides for a period of twelve months after publication of the final rule, for such skins
to be imported as skins or products without the trading history requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(B) requires that the information on each tag in a shipment be given on the accompanying
CITES export permit, re-export certificate or other Convention document, or on a separate sheet validated by the
same issuing authority as described in CITES Animals Committee's resolution adopted at its September 1993 meeting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(C) requires that for each crocodilian skin the importer or exporter shall provide a copy
of each CITES permit or certificate or identify the CITES permit/certificate number from the country of origin and
each country of re-export on the permit or on a separate sheet. The transaction history will assist in verifying that
the skins have moved through countries meeting the criteria of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii). Such information is now available
only through the time-consuming process of querying each country in turn to trace its document files to determine
the underlying importation record for any CITES document it has issued. Since commercial traders of skins and products
record and reflect the country of origin for all shipments at present and will have to keep track of skin tag numbers
under the CITES resolution, this provision simply requires that the sellers track the CITES certificate numbers
or transmit copies of these documents from their buyers. This provision is in keeping with the Animals Committee resolutions
calling on re-exporting countries to implement an administrative system for the effective matching of imports and
re-exports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(D) requires that the country of origin and the countries of re-export be in compliance
with the criteria of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A)&hyph;(iii)(F) and provides that countries meeting these criteria
will be named in a Notice of Information published by the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii) sets forth the conditions for import, export, and re-export of crocodilian products.
While it has frequently been suggested that the only absolutely reliable method for ``cradle to grave'' or ``harvest
to consumer'' control is individual product tagging, the Service is not proposing such measures at this time. If the
skin tagging inspection programs and criteria for evaluating whether party countries are implementing CITES responsibly
are followed, and inventory controls are conscientiously implemented by the re-exporting country government and/or
private sector, the Service hopes that more stringent measures for manufactured products will not be necessary to
control commingling of illegal crocodilians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii)(A) requires that for each crocodilian product the importer or exporter shall provide
a copy of each CITES permit or certificate or identify the CITES permit/certificate number from the country of origin
and each country of re-export of the skins included in the product, except that such importation history does not need
to be provided for any portions of a product which is 9 square inches or smaller. This provision is similar to the provision
for skins in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C), except that this provision exempts small pieces of skin from the importation
history requirement. The exception for pieces 9 square inches or smaller will permit items generally made from scraps,
such as watch bands, pieced belts, or trim, to be exempt from the importation history requirement. It must be emphasized,
however, that manufacturers still must accurately identify all species of wildlife contained in any importation.
Since many violations have been detected with the misuse of crocodilian skins on the gussets of handbags or trim on
shoes, manufacturers are still urged to maintain vigilance over their inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii)(B) requires that the country of origin and the countries of re-export be in compliance
with the criteria in subparagraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A)&hyph;(F) and provides that countries meeting these criteria
will be named in a Notice of Information published by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes that to achieve a reliable system for the manufacture of crocodilian products from lawful skins
and to be able to accurately identify what crocodilian the product was produced from, there must be effective CITES

Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(A) provides that each country of origin and each country of re-export be a member of CITES
and not have entered into any reservations for any species within the Order Crocodylia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs 17.42(c)(3)(iii) (B) and (C) require that no notices have been received by the Service indicating that
the CITES Parties or the CITES Secretariat (based on action by the Convention's Standing Committee) has determined
that the country of origin or any country of re-export does not have adequate domestic legislation to enforce the Convention,
that it has failed to properly implement the Convention, or that a moratorium on trade with that country is recommended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(D) requires that the countries of origin and re-export submit their annual reports

) require each country of origin and country of re-export to certify to the Service's Office of Management Authority
that it has the legal authority to inspect and seize or refuse entry for unlawful shipments of crocodilian skins and
products imported into or exported from that country and that it actually inspects no less than 40 percent of the crocodilian
shipments imported into the country for compliance with the CITES tagging and document requirements. Further, these
countries must certify that they require that crocodilian skins cannot be imported or exported without intact, uncut
tags from the country of origin. If a tag has become separated during processing or tanning, that skin may be utilized
in that country's domestic market. The premise behind this provision is the recognition that the CITES tagging requirement
will work only if it is strictly enforced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-exporting countries. Therefore, every piece of crocodilian skin which is not manufactured into a finished product
(and which exceeds 9 square inches in area) must bear an intact country of origin tag upon import and export. If the tags
are intact through all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-exporting countries, then they should be intact at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture so that the manufacturer can maintain an accurate inventory control system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) requires that if the country exporting or re-exporting is a country of manufacture, it must certify that it requires
a monitoring system that records tag numbers of skins received and relates the goods produced to the skins received.
The proposed rule does not specify the exact parameters of a particular inventory control system. The Service encourages
Party countries and the industry to explore established programs that have been in place for a number of years, as well
as innovative technologies, such as bar code marking, or other approaches, to develop workable means to maintain
accountability for products manufactured from tagged skins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iv) allows for the importation of crocodilian skins and parts directly from those countries
where the Nile crocodile populations are on Appendix II of CITES or for saltwater crocodile populations in Australia
or Papua New Guinea, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23, including those provisions implementing
the CITES resolution on the universal tagging system, are complied with. A direct import does not require routing
directly from the country of origin, as long as the specimen remains under customs control and merely transits through
a third country. Airway bills or shipping documents should indicate that the consignee/purchaser is located in the
United States, as shipments that enter the stream of commerce in a third country are not included under this provision
of the special rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(v) stipulates that no 50 CFR part 17 permits will be required for products of Nile crocodile
and saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea when imported into or exported from the United States
as non-commercial accompanying personal baggage. However, trophies, skins, parts, and products acquired in those
countries whose populations of saltwater or Nile crocodile populations are on CITES Appendix I, will require CITES
import permits, issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(4) stipulates that if a country of origin or re-export fulfills the criteria in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A&hyph;F),
the Service will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 informing the public to this effect, and the Service will implement these criteria by requiring compliance with the
Part 17 permit requirements for any skins or products that originated in or have been imported or exported through
any country not included on the approved list. A list of those countries that have met all criteria will be available
from the Service's Office of Management Authority.

E. Effects of the Special Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The degree of endangerment of the many crocodilian species varies by species and specific populations. Some crocodilian
species and populations are listed on Appendix I of CITES, and the remaining species and populations are included
in Appendix II. Some species are listed as threatened or endangered on the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife,
while other species are not included. In addition, actions have been taken by several countries to protect their wild
populations but allow trade in specimens bred or raised in captivity under appropriate management programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, trade in specimens from some populations is not detrimental to the wild population, and commercial trade is
allowed under CITES with proper export permits from certain countries of origin and re-exporting countries. The
Service's concern has been that trade in non-endangered species has in the past provided the opportunity for specimens
of the endangered species or populations to be commingled with legal trade, especially during the manufacturing
process. Numerous U.S. law enforcement actions as well as past actions by the CITES Parties attest to this concern.
The underlying premise behind this special rule is that the current management systems for the Appendix II populations
of Nile crocodile with assigned export quotas and the Australia and Papua New Guinea populations of saltwater crocodile
are being sufficiently sustained to support controlled commercial use; the key risk to these populations as well
as other similar-appearing crocodilians, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate controls in the countries of re-export, especially in those countries in which manufacturing occurs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CITES Parties have adopted and are in the process of implementing provisions of a universal tagging system for
crocodilian skins, and the Service supports these efforts. Adherence to the new marking requirements should reduce
the potential for substitution of illegal skins and reduce the trade control problems with the similarity in appearance
of skins and products among different species of crocodilians. Further, this proposed special rule contains other
steps designed to ensure that the United States does not become a market for illegal trade in crocodilian species and
to encourage other nations to control illegal trade. With the requirement that all skins are to be tagged up to the country
of manufacture, and that manufacturers maintain records concerning the products produced from the tagged skins
they receive, as well as document the chain of transactions preceding their acquisition of the skins, it is hoped that
there will be greater accountability and accuracy in the manufacturing of crocodilian skins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed special rule allowing limited trade in these saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile populations
should provide incentives to maintain wild populations, as well as encourage all countries involved in commerce
in crocodilian species to guard against illegal trade.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Saltwater Crocodile. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allowing import of farm-raised specimens is expected to benefit the conservation of wild populations. Under Australia's
conservation program, eggs or hatchlings are removed from the wild for crocodile farm operations under an approved
management program, and wild populations are carefully monitored. Should any decline occur in the wild populations,
the program would return a greater number of 1-year-old captive raised crocodiles to the wild than would have survived
to that age in the wild had no eggs or hatchlings been removed. Limited trade with the United States would provide economic
incentives for conserving wild populations and their habitats, owing to the dependence on them as the source of eggs.
Careful regulation of take and the prescription of specific corrective actions ensure that crocodile farming activities
will not cause declines of wild populations, and have the added potential of reversing declines caused by other factors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under this proposed special rule, parts or products of both the Australian and Papua New Guinea crocodile
populations imported into the United States must be identified in accordance with the CITES marking system for crocodile
skins and parts (refer to section on marking, and provisions of special rule). These marking requirements should
ensure that only legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken specimens are traded, and thus should also benefit the conservation of the species.

Nile crocodile. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appropriateness of the original endangered listing under the ESA and Appendix I listing under CITES has been the
subject of much international debate. However, improvements in the status of Nile crocodile populations and their
management have prompted the CITES Parties to transfer 11 national populations to Appendix II. The proposed downlisting
to a ``threatened'' status does not end trade controls for the species. The species remains in Appendix II of CITES
with export permits required. The proposed special rule should strengthen adherence to the CITES marking scheme
for crocodilian skins as well as compliance with other CITES trade control provisions. Allowing commercial importation
into the United States from CITES-approved countries is expected to benefit the species by encouraging proper conservation
practices and by promoting adherence to the CITES marking system.

Effects of the Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule, if made final, would change the status of the saltwater crocodile in Australia from endangered
to threatened, and treat the saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea as threatened because of similarity of appearance
so that the regulations specifically pertaining to threatened species (50 CFR 17.31, 17.32, 17.51, and 17.52) would
apply to it. A special rule is proposed with this rule to amend 50 CFR 17.42 to allow the importation, under certain conditions,
of whole and partial skins, and finished products thereof of Nile crocodile, which was previously reclassified as
threatened (58 FR 49870), and saltwater crocodile that originate in Australia and Papua New Guinea, without a threatened
species import permit for individual shipments otherwise required by 50 CFR part 17, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 all requirements of the special rule are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importation of skins and other parts of Nile crocodile from countries where this species is listed in Appendix II of
CITES and of the saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea will be allowed without part 17 permits only
in the case of shipments imported directly from respective range countries to the United States. Otherwise, the provisions
of the proposed special rule, when applicable, or all provisions of subpart D of 50 CFR part 17 shall apply to Nile and
saltwater crocodiles, and their eggs, meat, skins, and other parts and products.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1437r) (the ``1937 Act'') was enacted to encourage
increased resident management of public housing projects *&blank;*&blank;* ``to promote formation and development
of resident management entities.'' The Department implemented section 20 by regulations (24 CFR part 964 for Public
Housing, and 24 CFR part 905, subpart O for Indian Housing), that governed tenant participation and resident management
in public/Indian housing under Section 20 of the 1937 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Overview of Public Housing Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several weaknesses in the regulations have interfered with successful program implementation. The current regulations
fail to establish clear and detailed policy on resident participation and guidance on the structure for public housing
resident organizations. Additionally, the current regulations fail to establish specific requirements for resident
involvement in public/Indian housing management, and a strong partnership between the PHAs/IHAs (thereinafter
referred to as HAs) and resident councils. Internal conflict between competing resident councils in a development
poses serious problems to HUD with respect to program eligibility and participation, as well as HA recognition. The
Department is concerned about the need to provide more details on how resident councils/resident management corporations
should be structured and how to broaden tenant involvement in public housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes the need to increase the amount of cash contributions for resident council activities,
presently limited at three (3) dollars per unit per year, and to compensate resident council officers who are serving
as volunteers in the public housing community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary asked a former top HUD official to develop policy recommendations on the role of residents in the management
of public housing. Based on these recommendations, the Secretary established an Interim Resident Advisory Committee
consisting of representatives of regional and state resident organizations who developed a Policy Paper on resident
involvement in public housing. Public Housing Advocacy Groups: Public Housing Authorities Directors Association
(PHADA), Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA) and National Association of Housing Redevelopment
Officials (NAHRO), were given an opportunity to review and comment on the Policy Paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20 authorizes funds for technical assistance and training to resident councils (RCs)/resident management
corporations (RMCs) to promote increased resident management of public housing. HUD's experience in providing
grants to RCs/RMCs under the Public Housing Resident Management Program has revealed that major changes were needed
in the provisions of the program. RCs/RMCs and HAs across the country overwhelmingly requested revamping of the program
to assist in meeting their residents' need for economic development, education, job training and development, social
services, and opportunities for other self-help initiatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommendations from the Interim Resident Advisory Committee on Tenant Involvement in Public Housing, and requests
for changes in the Resident Management Technical Assistance Program resulted in the proposed comprehensive revision
of 24 CFR part 964.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The major changes in the proposed rule would allow for broader, more flexible programs aimed at increasing the capacity
of resident entities to participate significantly in all aspects of public housing operations while simultaneously
permitting further economic uplift opportunities, to the extent permitted under section 20 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937. Section 20 requires that all activities funded under it be related to improved living conditions
and public housing operations. (See &sect;&sect;905.967 and 964.205.) The Department is now proposing amendments
to section 20 to permit funding of a broader range of tenant development activities to include activities that are
not necessarily related to resident management or housing authority operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulation on the Tenant Participation and Resident Management Program is proposed to be renamed ``Tenant
Participation and Tenant Opportunities in the Public Housing Program.'' The proposed regulations would include
the Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP), which replaces the Resident Management Program under subpart C in the current
regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised program was created in response to requests from resident councils/resident management corporations
and HAs across the country for a more flexible program to address the needs in their communities related to encouraging
increased resident management activities as a means of improved living conditions and public housing operations.
The revised program is designed to prepare residents to experience the dignity of meaningful work; to own and operate
resident businesses; to move toward financial independence; to enable them to choose where they want to live; and
to assure meaningful participation in the management of their housing developments. The authority for the TOP program
comes from section 20 of the 1937 Act, which discusses resident management of public housing. Section 20(f) authorizes
technical assistance and training. Financial assistance in the form of technical assistance grants is provided
by the Secretary to RCs/RMCs to prepare for management activities in their housing development (hereinafter referred
to as TOP technical assistance grants). Technical assistance grants are available for ``the development of resident
managed entities, including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly
formed or existing entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects
and the securing of such support.'' TOP technical assistance grants can enable residents to manage their developments
or portions of their developments. The results are significant and multifaceted. For example, resident managed
activities have resulted in economic development, resident self-sufficiency, improved living conditions, and
enhanced social services for residents (e.g., child care and other youth programs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Resident Management Program would continue to be an option to resident councils/resident management corporations
who are interested in performing management functions in one or more projects of a HA. None of the requirements for
the resident management program will be changed. However, some of the provisions are being moved to other regulations,
or HUD documents. For example, the requirements under subpart C (&sect;964.39) governing the operating subsidy,
budget, operating reserves, etc. are proposed to be moved to 24 CFR Part 990_Annual Contributions for Operating Subsidy.
The Department believes these provisions of &sect;964.39 are more appropriately placed in that regulation. Also,
the requirements for the RMC management contract contents are being removed from subpart C and are contained in HUD
Notice PIH 93&hyph;56 (HA) which also includes a model management contract. This contract must be followed unless
HUD approves a requested change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A would be expanded to add policies on partnerships between HAs and residents. For example, HAs are required
to provide a duly elected resident council office space and meeting facilities, free of charge, for the purposes of
conducting resident activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the section on definitions (&sect;964.7) would be amended by removing terms such as ``resident council'' and
``resident management corporation'' and expanding the definition of these terms to provide clarity on the eligibility
of a voting member of the resident council and establish the frequency of elections for resident management corporations.
The definitions for other terms such as ``project'' and ``tenant participation'' are eliminated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current rule under subpart B would be expanded substantially to establish policies and procedures for HAs with
respect to resident participation activities. For example, HAs shall provide any funds they receive for resident
participation activities to the duly elected resident council. Parts 990 and 905, subpart J would be amended to require
an ``add-on'' of $25 per unit per year to the HA's operating subsidy calculation, which would be paid to the HA only if
appropriations were available for that purpose, to support activities of the duly elected resident council. The
HUD Circular HM 7475.9 dated February 10, 1992, authorized funds not to exceed three ($3) dollars per unit per year.
The Department believes that an increase of $22 per unit per year is reasonable and, if available, would guarantee
the resources necessary to create a bonafide partnership among the duly elected resident council and the HA. Strong
partnerships are critical for achieving mutual goals contained in this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, HUD proposes to encourage HAs to provide stipends in an amount up to $200 per month/per officer to resident council
officers who serve as volunteers in the public housing development to carry out these duties and functions as officers
of the resident council. The Department believes that these volunteers should be reimbursed for their expenses related
to volunteer efforts, such as child care, transportation, special equipment, clothing, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current part 964 regulations lack specificity regarding resident elections and organizational policies, and
have made it difficult to determine what is a duly elected resident council and that has caused conflicts among the
residents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would add new policies and procedures for resident councils by defining what is a duly elected
resident council, detailing minimum standards for elections of resident councils and specifying the relationship
between the resident councils and resident management corporations. Resident councils would be required to meet
HUD's election standards in order to receive official recognition from the HA and HUD, as well as to receive funds in
conjunction with the conduct of resident council business. The role of the jurisdiction-wide resident council would
be established under the proposed rule. The rule also contains provisions that expand the resident participation
requirements to strongly support resident participation in all aspects of a HA's management operations and that
give rights to residents to freely organize and represent their interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would add a new subpart D to implement the Family Investment Center (FIC) Program under section 22
of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437t) (added by section 515 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act).
The FIC program provides families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities.
This new subpart will be added to part 964 to include FIC because it complements the Department's resident participation
and self-sufficiency initiatives. The program was proposed by a national association on behalf of numerous housing
authorities. Representatives from public/Indian housing authorities, resident councils/resident management
corporations and nonprofit housing agencies were convened at the Department to discuss program provisions and provide
policy recommendations during the initial program planning stage. Some HAs will combine their FIC and Family Self-Sufficiency
(FSS) programs. This rule would provide that section 8 FSS Program participants are eligible to participate in the
FIC program when it is combined with FSS, but that income exclusions that are provided to public housing residents
participating in employment training and supportive service programs would not apply to Section 8 FSS families.
The treatment of the FSS escrow account for public housing FIC/FSS families is not addressed in this proposed rule,
but will be included in the final rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;964.320 provides HUD policy on training, employment and contracting of public/Indian housing residents
under section 3 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1968. Section 915 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 made significant changes to section 3. HUD recently published a proposed rule implementing those changes
(see 58 FR 52534, October 8, 1993). Section 3, as amended, requires that HAs make their best efforts, consistent with
existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, to amend contracts for work to be performed in connection
with development, operation and modernization assistance provided pursuant to sections 5, 9 and 14 of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937. As amended, section 3 establishes an order of priority to which the HA's efforts must be directed. Thus,
the first level of priority is to residents of the housing development, for which the assistance is provided. This
proposed rule includes provisions consistent with the proposed section 3 rule.

The reader should note that combination terms such as ``tenant and resident'', ``tenant council,'' and ``resident
council'', and ``tenant management corporation'' and ``resident management corporation'' are similar terms and
may be used interchangeably. Hereafter, for ease of discussion, the proposed rule will use the terms resident, resident
council and resident management corporation, as appropriate.

IV. Amendments of the Tenant Participation and Tenant Opportunities Program in Public Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Regulatory Actions: 964
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on recommendations of the Interim Resident Advisory Committee, program experience, and comments from various
Housing Interest Groups, the regulations are proposed to be revised to: (1) Expand tenant participation in various
programs and involvement in public housing operations, and (2) change the Resident Management Program to the Tenant
Opportunities Program (TOP), and (3) add a new subpart D to the 964 regulations which contains policies and procedures
for the FIC Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section discusses each of the specific regulatory revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Subpart A would be amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Section 964.1 Purpose would be streamlined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Section 964.3 Applicability and scope would remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Section 964.7 Definitions would be amended by removing several definitions such as project and tenant participation;
by moving terms such as Resident Council and Resident Management Corporation to a more appropriate section under
subpart B, and by expanding definitions; and by adding new terms which relate to the FIC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Section 964.11 HUD policy on tenant participation would be amended to strongly support tenant participation in
all the functions of a HA's management operations and give rights to residents to freely organize and represent their
interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Section 964.12 HUD policy on Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP) would provide HUD's policy on the Tenant Opportunities
Program. Subpart C of the current regulation would be changed from ``Resident Management Program'' to ``Tenant Opportunities
Program'' (TOP). The name is being changed to TOP because it reflects the evolution of the program over time, to enhance
resident capacity in a variety of ways, including job training, economic development, and self-sufficiency activities
carried out by resident councils/resident management corporations in public housing. Resident management is a
component of TOP and resident councils/resident management corporations may continue to engage in activities relative
to public housing management. Tenant opportunities programs are proven to be effective in facilitating economic
uplift as well as in improving the overall conditions in public housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Section 964.14 HUD policy on partnerships would be added to provide HUD policy on Partnerships between HAs and residents.
Strong partnerships between HAs and resident councils/resident management corporations are key to the success
of program objectives, and critical for achieving specific and mutual goals and creating positive change for residents
in public housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Section 964.15 HUD policy on resident management would remain unchanged. This section states HUD's support for
resident councils/resident management corporations who are interested in becoming resident managed entities
in public housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Section 964.16 HUD role in activities under this part_Monitoring would be added to describe HUD's proactive responsibility
for promoting tenant participation and tenant opportunities in public housing. It provides that HUD will monitor
program progress to ensure efficient and effective operations pursuant to this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Section 964.18 HA role in activities under subparts B&amp;C would establish a stronger HA role under this subpart.
HAs shall, upon request, provide office space to a duly elected resident council and shall negotiate in good faith
usage of community space for meetings and other activities for residents. HAs have a responsibility to negotiate
such usage of space with the duly elected resident council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Section 964.24 HUD policy on FIC program would provide HUD's policy and support for the FIC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subpart B would be amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Section 964.100 Role of resident council which establishes the role of a resident council and Section 964.105 Role
of the jurisdiction-wide resident council which establishes the role of a jurisdiction-wide resident council would
be added to the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Section 964.110 Resident membership on HA Board of Commissioners would encourage resident membership on HA Board
of Commissioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Section 964.115 Resident council requirements would describe the provisions necessary for the Resident Council
to receive official recognition from the HA and HUD. In the current rule, this provision was included in the definitions
section, and in this proposed rule it becomes a separate section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Section 964.117 Resident council partnerships would be added to encourage and promote partnerships between the
resident councils and public/private organizations. While the Department encourages partnerships to complement
council activities, such organizations must not become the governing entity of the resident council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Section 964.120 Resident management corporation requirements would establish characteristics in order to receive
formal recognition by the HA and HUD. In the current rule, this was included in the definitions sections and in this
proposed rule, it becomes a separate section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Section 964.125 Eligibility for resident council membership would be added to provide guidance on eligibility
for council membership. This section establishes that any member of a household, who is on the lease, may be a member
of a resident council. However, in order to be a voting member of the resident council, a person's name must appear on
the lease of a unit in the public housing development, and he/she must be: (1) A legal head of household (means the member
of the family who is the head of the household for purposes of determining income eligibility and rent), or (2) 18 years
of age or older. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Section 964.130 Election procedures and standards would be added to provide minimum standards for resident council
elections including the requirement for supervision by an independent third party. HAs shall monitor the resident
council's elections to ensure compliance with HUD's minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Section 964.135 Resident involvement in HA management would be added to provide policy on resident involvement
in HA management operations. Residents shall participate fully in the overall policy development and direction
of a HA operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Section 964.140 Resident training would be added to encourage HAs to take the lead in providing training opportunities
for public housing residents. If residents are willing, they may receive training from the HA and become involved
in implementing various Federal programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Section 964.145 Conflict of interest would be added to provide policy on resident council officers serving as contractors
or as employees of a HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Section 964.150 Funding tenant participation would be added to establish policy on funding duly elected resident
councils. Subject to appropriations, HAs shall provide funds to the duly elected resident council for tenant participation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
j. Section 964.340 Resident compensation for FIC would provide guidelines governing employment compensation under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Indian Housing Changes_Part 905 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also revises 24 CFR part 905, subpart O, ``Resident Participation and Opportunities''. The Indian
housing section is similar to its public housing counterpart, but does not contain some of the provisions in 24 CFR
part 964 in an effort to streamline the regulations and tailor them specifically to the generally smaller size of most
Indian Housing Authorities (IHA). However, all activities, functions and benefits permitted under any public housing
resident programs will remain eligible activities, functions and benefits for Indian housing resident programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major changes in the proposed rule will allow for broader, more flexible programs aimed at increasing the capacity
of Indian housing resident organizations and resident management corporations to carry out their organizational
functions in a more structured manner while simultaneously permitting further economic uplift opportunities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the subpart there is a general section; a Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP) section; and a Family Investment
Centers Program section. The current Indian Housing Resident Management Program under existing regulations is
viable and remains an option under TOP. None of the requirements for the resident management program will be changed;
however, some sections are being moved to other sections of the 905 regulations or HUD handbooks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Miscellaneous Conforming Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes that have been made to other parts are the exclusion from income of stipends to RC officers and of training grants
under the FIC program that would be added to 905 and 913; the provision for payments to duly elected resident council
officers, and the inclusion of requirements governing the RMC Operating subsidy, budget, operating reserves, etc.,
that would be made to 990; and changes for the resident participation subpart that would be made in part 905 to parallel
changes in part 964.

Justification for Shortened Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the general practice of the Department to provide a 60-day comment period on all proposed rules. However, the
Department is shortening its usual 60-day comment period to 30 days because it would be contrary to the public interest
to delay the benefits of the rule another 30 days and because it is unnecessary to have a longer comment period. The policies
contained in this proposed rule are the result of collaborative efforts with various housing interest groups, i.e.,
public housing resident leaders, Public/Indian Housing Authorities, Public Housing Advocacy Groups. This should
decrease the need for the usual time period for comment, since consultation took place while the policy was being developed.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule provides substantial revisions to the regulations concerning
Tenant Participation and Management in Public Housing under which resident councils/resident management corporations
receive funding on a competitive basis. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact on small entities since
resident councils/resident management corporations will continue to obtain by contract technical assistance
to carry out program activities.

Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in
the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning
and Review. Any changes made to the proposed rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file
which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh

Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review
under the order. The revised proposed rule is consistent with federalism principles since it reduces unnecessary
burdens on resident organizations. Since participation by resident organizations is discretionary, this proposed
rule lacks the direct and substantial effects on resident organizations required for a policy with federalism implications
under the Order.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
proposed rule has a beneficial effect on the family, and thus, does not require further review. No significant change
in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs
relate to family concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520). The Department has determined that
the following provisions contain information collection requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has estimated the public reporting burden involved in the information collections contained in the
proposed rule as shown below. The public reporting burden for each of these collections of information is estimated
to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculation of operating subsidy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operating subsidy will be calculated separately for any project managed by a resident management corporation. This
subsidy computation will be the same as the separate computation made for the balance of the projects in the HA in accordance
with subpart J of this part, with the following exceptions: (1) The project managed by a resident management corporation
will have an Allowable Expense Level based on the actual expenses for the project in the fiscal year immediately preceding
management under this subpart. These expenditures will include the project's share of any expenses which are overhead
or centralized HA expenditures. The expenses must represent a normal year's expenditures for the project, and must
exclude all expenditures which are not normal fiscal year expenditures as to amount or as to the purpose for which expended.
Documentation of this expense level must be presented with the project budget and approved by HUD. Any project expenditures
funded from a source of income other than operating subsidies or income generated by the locally owned Indian housing
program will be excluded from the subsidy calculation. For budget years after the first budget year under management
by the resident management corporation, the Allowable Expense Level will be calculated as it is for all other projects,
in accordance with subpart J of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The resident management corporation project will estimate dwelling rental income based on the rent roll of the
project immediately preceding the assumption of management responsibility under this subpart, increased by the
estimate of inflation of resident income used in calculating PFS subsidy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The resident management corporation will exclude, from its estimate of other income, any increased income directly
generated by activities of the corporation or facilities operated by the corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any reduction in the subsidy of a HA that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the HA shall not affect
the subsidy calculation for the resident management corporation project.

The resident management corporation and the HA shall submit a separate operating budget, including the calculation
of operating subsidy eligibility in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, for the project managed by a resident
management corporation to HUD for approval. This budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify
which expenditures are related to the responsibilities of the resident management corporation and which are related
to functions which will continue to be performed by the HA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operating reserves. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart
and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the resident management corporation
will have transferred, into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the host HA, an operating reserve. Where all
maintenance responsibilities for the resident-managed project are the responsibility of the corporation, the
amount of the reserve made available to projects under this subpart will be the per unit cost amount available in the
HA operating reserve, exclusive of all inventories, prepaids and receivables (at the end of the HA fiscal year preceding
implementation), multiplied by the number of units in the project operated in accordance with the provisions of this
subpart. Where some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the resident management corporation,
the contract may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the
corporation's sub-account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The use of the reserve will be subject to all administrative procedures generally applicable to the Indian housing
program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve will be for eligible expenditures which are incorporated into
an operating budget subject to approval by HUD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 of the Financial
Management Handbook, 7475.1 REV, and interest generated will be included in the calculation of operating subsidy
in accordance with subpart J of this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The HA shall provide funds it receives for this purpose to the duly elected resident council to use for resident
participation activities. This shall be an add-on to the Performance Funding System (PFS), as provided by 24 CFR part
990, to permit HAs to fund $25 per unit per year for resident services, subject to the availability of appropriations.
Of this amount, $15 per unit per year would be provided to fund appropriate activities for duly elected resident councils,
and $10 per unit per year would be used by the HA to pay for costs incurred in carrying out tenant participation activities
under subpart B of this rule, including the expenses for an arbitrator required under subpart B &sect;964.130. This
will guarantee the resources necessary to create a bonafide partnership among the duly elected resident council,
the HA and HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A duly elected resident council shall receive tenant services funding regardless of the HA's financial status.
The resident council funds shall not be impacted or restricted by the HA financial status and all said funds must be
used for the purpose set forth in subparts B &amp; C under this rule.

developments. The amount of the stipend, up to $200 per month/per officer, shall be decided locally by the resident
council and the HA. Pursuant to &sect;913.106, stipends are excluded from income for rent purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Funding provided by a HA to a duly elected resident council may be made only under a written agreement between the
HA and a resident council, which includes a resident council budget and assurance that all resident council expenditures
will not contravene provisions of law and will promote serviceability, efficiency, economy and stability in the
operation of the local development. The agreement must require the local resident council to account to the HA for
the use of the funds and permit the HA to inspect and audit the resident council's financial records related to the agreement.

Resident management requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following requirements apply when a HA and its residents are interested in providing for resident performance
of several management functions in one or more projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident management corporation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Resident councils interested in contracting with a HA must establish a resident management corporation that meets
the requirements for such a corporation, as specified in subpart B. The RMC and its employees must demonstrate their
ability and skill to perform in the particular areas of management pursuant to the management contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HA responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAs shall give full and serious consideration to resident management corporations seeking to enter into a management
contract with the HA. A HA shall enter into good-faith negotiations with a corporation seeking to contract to provide
management services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duty to bargain in good faith. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a HA refuses to negotiate with a resident management corporation in good faith or, after negotiations, refuses
to enter into a contract, the corporation may file an informal appeal with HUD, setting out the circumstances and providing
copies of relevant materials evidencing the corporation's efforts to negotiate a contract. HUD shall require the
HA to respond with a report stating the HA's reasons for rejecting the corporation's contract offer or for refusing
to negotiate. Thereafter, HUD shall require the parties (with or without the direct HUD participation) to undertake
or to resume negotiations on a contract providing for resident management, and shall take such other actions as are
necessary to resolve the conflicts between the parties. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date HUD
required the parties to undertake or resume such negotiations, HUD shall serve notice on both parties that administrative
remedies have been exhausted (except that, pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties, the time for negotiations
may be extended by no more than an additional 30 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management contract
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A management contract between the HA and a resident management corporation is required for property management.
The HA and the resident management corporation may agree to the performance by the corporation of any or all management
functions for which the HA is responsible to HUD under the ACC and any other functions not inconsistent with the ACC
and applicable state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procurement requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The management contract shall be treated as a contracting out of services, and must be subject to any provision of a
collective bargaining agreement regarding the contracting out of services to which the HA is subject. Provisions
on competitive bidding and requirements of prior written HUD approval of contracts contained in the ACC do not apply
to the decision of a HA to contract with a RMC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibited activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A HA may not contract for assumption by the resident management corporation of the HA's underlying responsibilities
to HUD under the ACC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bonding and insurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before assuming any management responsibility under its contract, the RMC must provide fidelity bonding and insurance,
or equivalent protection that is adequate (as determined by HUD and the HA) to protect HUD and the HA against loss, theft,
embezzlement, or fraudulent acts on the part of the resident management corporation or its employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver of HUD requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the joint request of a resident management corporation and the HA, HUD may waive any requirement that HUD has established
and that is not required by law, if HUD determines, after consultation with the resident management corporation and
the HA, that the requirement unnecessarily increases the costs to the project or restricts the income of the project;
and that the waiver would be consistent with the management contract and any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Any waiver granted to a resident management corporation under this section will apply as well to the HA to the extent
the waiver affects the HA's remaining responsibilities relating to the resident management corporation's project.

Operating subsidy will be calculated separately for any project managed by a resident management corporation. This
subsidy computation will be the same as the separate computation made for the balance of the projects in the PHA in accordance
with this part, with the following exceptions:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The project managed by a resident management corporation will have an Allowable Expense Level based on the actual
expenses for the project in the fiscal year immediately preceding management under this subpart. These expenditures
will include the project's share of any expenses which are overhead or centralized PHA expenditures. The expenses
must represent a normal year's expenditures for the project, and must exclude all expenditures which are not normal
fiscal year expenditures as to amount or as to the purpose for which expended. Documentation of this expense level
must be presented with the project budget and approved by HUD. Any project expenditures funded from a source of income
other than operating subsidies or income generated by the locally owned public housing program will be excluded from
the subsidy calculation. For budget years after the first budget year under management by the resident management
corporation, the Allowable Expense Level will be calculated as it is for all other projects in accordance with &sect;990.105(e)(5).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Subject to &sect;990.403 of this section, the amount of funds provided by a PHA to a project managed by a resident
management corporation under this subpart may not be reduced during the three-year period beginning on February
5, 1988 or on such later date as a resident management corporation first assumes management responsibility for the
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) For purposes of determining the amount of funds provided to a project under &sect;990.402(a) of this section,
the provision of technical assistance by the PHA to the resident management corporation will not be included.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The resident management corporation and the PHA shall submit a separate operating budget, including the calculation
of operating subsidy eligibility in accordance with &sect;990.401 of this section, for the project managed by a resident
management corporation to HUD for approval. This budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify
which expenditures are related to the responsibilities of the resident management corporation and which are related
to the functions which will continue to be performed by the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart
and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the resident management corporation
will have transferred, into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the host PHA, an operating reserve. Where all
maintenance responsibilities for the resident-managed project are the responsibility of the corporation, the
amount of the reserve made available to projects under this subpart will be the per unit cost amount available to the
PHA operating reserve, exclusive of all inventories, prepaids and receivables (at the end of the PHA fiscal year preceding
implementation), multiplied by the number of units in the project operated in accordance with the provision of this
subpart. Where some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the resident management corporation,
the contract may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the
corporation's sub-account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The use of the reserve will be subject to all administrative procedures applicable to the conventionally owned
public housing program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve will be for eligible expenditures which are incorporated
into an operating budget subject to approval by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Financial Management
Handbook, 7476.1 REV.1 and interest generated will be included in the calculation of operating subsidy in accordance
with this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Operating subsidy calculated in accordance with &sect;964.401 will reflect changes in inflation, utility rates
and consumption, and changes in the number of units in the resident management project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In addition to the amount of income derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges) and the operating
subsidy calculated in accordance with &sect;990.401 of this subpart, the contract may specify that income be provided
to the project from other sources of income of the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The following conditions may not affect the amounts to be provided to a project managed by a resident management
corporation under this subpart: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any reduction in the total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any change in the total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of project-specific characteristics that are not
shared by the project managed by the corporation under this subpart.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any income generated by a resident management corporation that exceeds the income estimated for the income category
involved as specified in the RMC's management contract must be excluded in subsequent years in calculating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The operating subsidy provided to a PHA under part 990 subpart A of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The funds provided by the PHA to the resident management corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The management contract must specify the amount of income expected to be derived from the project (from sources
such as rents and charges) and the amount of income to be provided to the project from the other sources of income of the
PHA (such as operating subsidy under part 990 subpart A of this chapter, interest income, administrative fees, and
rents). These income estimates must be calculated on a PHA-wide basis, as well as for each category of income on which
the PHA and the resident management corporation agree, consistent with HUD's administrative instructions. Income
estimates may provide for proration of anticipated project income between the corporation and the PHA, based upon
the management and other project-associated responsibilities (if any) that are to be retained by the PHA under the
contract.

Any revenues retained by a resident management corporation under &sect;990.404 of this subpart may only be used for
purposes of improving the maintenance and operation of the project, establishing businesses enterprises that employ
residents of public housing, or acquiring additional dwelling units for lower income families. Units acquired by
the resident management corporation will not be eligible for payment of operating subsidy.
