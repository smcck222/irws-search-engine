SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning the inspection and handling of livestock for exportation by
requiring that all animals intended for exportation other than by land (that is to say, by air or sea) to Mexico or Canada
receive a final inspection by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service veterinarian at an export inspection
facility at a designated port of embarkation. We believe this action is necessary to help ensure that only healthy
animals are exported from the United States.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the
regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. Section 91.3(a) requires, among
other things, that all animals intended for exportation to Mexico or Canada, except cattle from Mexico imported into
the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return to Mexico, be accompanied from the State of origin of the
export movement to the border of the United States by an origin health certificate. The origin health certificate,
as defined in &sect;91.1, is an official document issued by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
representative or an accredited veterinarian at the point of origin of a shipment of animals to be moved under part
91, which shows the identification tag, tattoo, or registration number or similar identification of each animal
to be moved, the number, breed, sex, and approximate age of the animals covered by the document, the date and place of
issuance, the points of origin and destination, the consignor, and the consignee, and which states that the animal
or animals identified on the certificate meet the export health requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 91.3(b) requires, among other things, that all animals in export shipments, except animals intended for
export to Mexico or Canada, be inspected, tested, or treated as prescribed in the regulations before the movement
of the export shipment to the export inspection facility. Animals intended for export to Mexico or Canada must be inspected,
tested, or treated as prescribed in the regulations before movement from the State of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 91.14(a) requires that all animals, except animals being exported to Mexico or Canada, be exported through
designated ports of embarkation with export inspection facilities that meet the standards for export inspection
facilities specified in &sect;91.14(c). Section 91.15(a) requires that all animals offered for exportation to
foreign countries, except Mexico or Canada, be inspected by an APHIS veterinarian at either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An export inspection facility at a port designated in &sect;91.14(a); or (2) In special cases, at a port or inspection
facility designated by the Administrator under &sect;91.14(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until recently, exporters shipping animals to Mexico or Canada have moved the animals by land from the United States.
All animals moved by land to Mexico or Canada are inspected at their point of origin by an APHIS representative or an
accredited veterinarian. Upon arrival at a land border port of entry in Mexico or Canada, the animals are inspected
by a Mexican or Canadian veterinarian, respectively. Because of the inspections conducted by Mexican or Canadian
veterinarians, APHIS veterinarians have not conducted these inspections at land border port crossings. The close
proximity of U.S. land border ports to the Mexican and Canadian land border ports have facilitated the return to the
United States of any animals that may have been diseased or may have been exposed to disease.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the past year, however, many exporters have begun to move animals by air or sea from the United States to Mexico or
Canada. This practice has raised a concern that animals could be moved directly into the interior of these two countries
without a final veterinary inspection prior to that movement, thus circumventing the inspection system that helps
prevent the exportation of diseased animals or animals that may have been exposed to disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the disease status of any animals that are moved from the United States other than by land to Mexico or Canada,
we are proposing that animals intended for exportation by air or sea to either of these two countries meet the same requirements
as animals exported to other foreign countries under &sect;&sect;91.3(a) and (b), 91.14(a), and 91.15(a). We, therefore,
are proposing to amend the regulations to limit the exception for animals exported to Mexico or Canada to those animals
intended for export to those countries by land. Such exportations would not have to meet the requirements in the above-cited
regulations for the reasons already discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been determined to be not
significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would require a final inspection at an export inspection facility at a designated port of embarkation
for all animals intended for export to Mexico and Canada by air or sea. Animals intended for export to Mexico and Canada
by air or sea would first be inspected by an APHIS representative or an accredited veterinarian in the State of origin.
The APHIS representative or an accredited veterinarian would issue an origin health certificate, which an authorized
APHIS veterinarian in the State of origin would endorse. At the port of embarkation, the animals would receive a final
inspection by an APHIS veterinarian before they would be allowed to leave the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exporter would be charged a user fee ($33.50 an hour plus reimbursable overtime when applicable) for the final
inspection as provided in 9 CFR part 130. This inspection could require 6 to 8 hours of work for one or two veterinarians.
The total cost of inspection for an air shipment from Miami ranges from about $200 to $600 a shipment. The total cost
of inspection for a sea shipment from Hawaii ranges from $1,000 to $2,000 a shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These costs are very small compared to the value of the animals being shipped. For example, gilts (young, female pigs
or immature sows) may be valued at $500 to $1,000 or more a head, depending upon breed. Heifers (young cows that have
not borne calves) may be worth $2,000 a head. One air shipment may contain as many as 240 gilts or 80 heifers. One sea shipment
from Hawaii may contain 1,000 to 2,000 heifers. Clearly, the costs of inspection are relatively minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the exporting entities involved generally are not small (defined as having 100 or fewer employees). They
are large companies, often with worldwide operations that handle large volumes of traded animals. For example, about
14,000 swine were exported by air from Miami last year, all by a few large companies. There are now only two exporting
companies operating out of Hawaii, one of which is a ``small'' entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No additional collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.) are contained in the proposed rule. The Board of Directors of the FDIC has concluded that the notices required
of depository institutions which seek to establish or relocate a remote service facility under the proposed regulation
will not constitute a ``collection of information'' as defined in 5 CFR 1320.7 which has not already been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget. Consequently, no information has been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the FDIC hereby certifies that the
proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC has reached this conclusion because the effect of the rule, if it is ultimately promulgated in its current
form, will be to reduce the recordkeeping, reporting and compliance requirements that are imposed upon small entities
rather than to increase them. This is because the proposed rule seeks to create a blanket approval process for requests
that must receive the prior written consent of the FDIC. The proposed rule imposes no new recordkeeping or reporting
requirements upon small entities since notices required are abbreviated versions of letter applications currently
required of banks. Furthermore, most institutions would not be required to give public notice of the transaction
which would reduce burden on the requesting institutions.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC desires to reduce the regulatory burden on banks seeking to establish or relocate RSFs. Currently, banks
desiring to establish an initial RSF must comply with all the application and publication requirements applicable
to the establishment of a ``brick and mortar'' branch office. See 12 CFR 303.2(a) &amp; (c). Successive RSFs may be
established or relocated without a formal application pursuant to somewhat less involved requirements. See 12 CFR
303.2(c). The existing regulation does not differentiate based upon the condition of the institution submitting
the application; the only difference it recognizes is whether or not this is an initial application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the limited investment represented by an RSF and the fact that all the information in the FDIC's possession
indicates that consumers are of the opinion that RSFs are a convenient and desirable banking service, the FDIC is proposing
that its existing regulation concerning the establishment and relocation of RSFs be revised to lessen the application
and notice requirements which an institution must satisfy before it may establish or relocate an RSF. Furthermore,
unlike the existing regulation, the proposal sets forth even more streamlined procedures for banks with Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA) ratings of satisfactory or better. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the proposal revises &sect;303.2(c) of the FDIC's regulations to provide that a state nonmember bank
or an insured state-licensed branch of a foreign bank whose most recent CRA rating is Satisfactory or better may establish
and operate or relocate an RSF by filing a letter with the appropriate FDIC regional director. The letter shall contain
the location of the RSF and either a representation that the site is not included in or eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places or written verification that in the opinion of the appropriate state historic
preservation officer the establishment or relocation of the RSF will have no adverse effect on a historic site. Unless
the institution is notified otherwise by the FDIC within seven days of receipt of the letter, the institution may establish
or relocate the RSF. The FDIC is proposing that the existing public notice requirements be dispensed with in this case.
See proposed &sect;303.2(c)(2). However, if the institution cannot make such representations concerning compliance
with the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it shall proceed pursuant to &sect;303.2(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that the state nonmember bank or insured state-licensed branch's most recent CRA rating is not Satisfactory
or better, proposed &sect;303.2(c)(3) provides that the institution shall file the letter described in &sect;303.2(c)(2)
of the proposal and comply with the existing notice provisions of &sect;303.6(f). Unless the institution is notified
otherwise within fifteen days after completion of processing of the letter, the institution may establish or relocate
the RSF. In the event that a protest is filed or other objection is taken, the institution may not proceed until the FDIC
provides written notice of its approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remaining proposed revisions are to &sect;303.6 (a) and (f) of the FDIC's regulations. They are technical in nature
in order to conform these sections, which concern application procedures and public notices of application filings,
to the new procedures set forth in proposed &sect;303.2. First, the proposal revises &sect;303.6(a) (2) and (3) to
take into account the different procedures set forth in &sect;303.2(c) for institutions with CRA ratings of Satisfactory
or better as opposed to institutions with CRA ratings of less than Satisfactory. Second, the heading of &sect;303.6(f)(1)(A)
would be revised under the proposal to make it clear that section applies to applications to establish an RSF. Third,
the proposal amends &sect;303.6(f)(2) to delete any reference to remote service facilities. This is being proposed
in order to conform this section of the regulation with the proposed revision to &sect;303.6(a) which deletes the
publication requirement for applicants with CRA ratings of satisfactory or better.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is of the opinion that this is a sensible proposal which will substantially reduce the regulatory burden
imposed on state nonmember banks and insured state-licensed branches of foreign banks that desire to establish or
relocate an RSF without adversely affecting the FDIC's ability to assure the safety and soundness of the insured financial
institutions it regulates or its responsibilities under the CRA. The Board also requests comment on whether the proposal
should treat different types of RSFs differently, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an RSF which caters exclusively to one bank's customers as opposed to a shared RSF which is utilized by customers of
many banks.

of the proposed or relocated RSF, including street address (unless one has not been assigned to the location), and
either a representation that the site of the proposed or relocated RSF is not included in or eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places or written verification that in the opinion of the appropriate state historic
preservation officer the establishment or relocation of the RSF will have no adverse effect on a historic site. Unless
the institution is notified otherwise by the FDIC within seven days of receipt of the letter, the institution may establish
and operate or relocate the RSF. In the event that the institution cannot represent in good faith that the site of the
proposed or relocated RSF is not included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
or evidence that written verification has been obtained from the appropriate state historic preservation officer,
the institution shall proceed pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

the institution may establish and operate or relocate the RSF; provided however, that in the event that a protest is
filed with the FDIC or other objection is taken prior to completion of processing the letter, the institution shall
not establish and operate or relocate the RSF until the FDIC provides written notice of its approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is proposing to amend the National Security Industrial Base Regulations
to require U.S. firms entering into offset agreements associated with the sale of weapons systems or defense-related
items to foreign governments or foreign companies to provide BXA certain information regarding those agreements
when they exceed $5,000,000 in value. This new regulation is being promulgated pursuant to the Defense Production
Act of 1950, as amended. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, information, or
advice relative to these proposed regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 amended the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the Act). The Act now requires
that U.S. firms entering into contracts for the sale of weapons systems or defense-related items to foreign countries
or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnish information regarding such sales to the Secretary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commerce (the Secretary). The Act also now requires the Secretary to establish regulations to collect this information
and to protect it from public disclosure unless public disclosure is specifically authorized by the firm furnishing
the information. The Act further requires the Secretary to serve as the President's executive agent in preparing
an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report will include an aggregated summary of information provided to the Secretary by U.S. industry pursuant
to the regulation proposed here. It will address the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness,
employment, and trade of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This proposed rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 5 to 60 hours per response, with an
average of 10 hours, including time for reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of
information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Brad Botwin, Director, Strategic Analysis Division,
Office of Industrial Resource Administration, Attention: Offset Regulation Comments, room 3878, U.S. Department
of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation
of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. It is anticipated that the rule will primarily affect large defense contractors that engage in offset agreements
with foreign governments. Moreover, the rule is not expected to pose a burden because firms engaging in offset transactions
already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must prepare periodic accounts of progress toward fulfillment of offset obligations for the foreign entity that
is party to the offset agreement. The information to be collected pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations is less than that required by these foreign parties. With regard to new offset agreements entered
into, the information requested is readily available and will take a minimum amount of time to assemble by the parties
involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the
effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation is specifically exempt pursuant to the Defense Production
Act of 1950, as amended. (50 U.S.C. app. 2159). Further, no other law requires a notice of proposed rulemaking to be
issued for this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because of the importance of the issues raised by this regulation, this rule is being issued in proposed form.
Pursuant to the Act, comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. (50 U.S.C. app. 2159(b)(1)).
Accordingly, the Department encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time
to permit the fullest consideration of their views.

The period for submission of comments will close May 26, 1994. The Department will consider all comments received
before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the comment
period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept
comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of its business
proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the person submitting
the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All comments on these regulations
will be a matter of public record and will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy
and completeness, the Department requires comments in written form. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda,
which will also be a matter of public record and will be available for public review and copying. Communications from
agencies of the United States Government or foreign governments will not be made available for public inspection.

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 require the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations for U.S.
firms entering into contracts for the sale of weapons or defense-related items to foreign countries or foreign firms
that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to furnish information regarding such sales.
The Secretary of Commerce has designated the Bureau of Export Administration as the organization responsible for
implementing this provision. The information provided by U.S. firms will be aggregated and used to determine the
impact of offset transactions on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade
of the United States. Summary reports will be submitted annually to the Congress pursuant to section 309 of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, as amended.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') solicits comments on a broad range of issues relating to
antimanipulation regulation of securities offerings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').
In particular, the Commission is conducting a comprehensive review of Rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7, and 10b&hyph;8
(``Trading Practices Rules'') under the Exchange Act in light of significant changes in the securities markets and
in distribution practices in recent years. The Commission requests comment on the concepts identified in this release
and any other issues that commenters believe are relevant. Following review of public comments, the Commission will
determine whether rulemaking or other action is appropriate.

The Commission's principal antimanipulation provisions that apply to securities offerings, Rules 10b-6, 10b-7,
and 10b-8 (``Trading Practices 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
Rules'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under the Exchange Act, are intended to assure prospective investors in a securities offering that the offering's
price has not been influenced improperly by persons who have a significant interest in the success of the offering.
Rule 10b-6 is an antimanipulation rule that is intended to prevent those persons participating in a distribution
of securities from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in order to facilitate the distribution,
and to protect the integrity of the securities trading market as an independent pricing mechanism. Rule 10b-7 prevents
any stabilizing bid from being made to facilitate an offering of a security except for the purpose of preventing or
retarding a decline in the open market price of the security. Rule 10b-8 pertains to distributions of securities being
offered through rights on a pro rata basis to security holders, and restricts the prices at which rights may be purchased
as well as the prices at which the securities being distributed, or securities of the same class and series, may be offered
or sold.

Since these rules were adopted or last significantly amended, there have been significant changes in the structure
of the markets, including the expanded role of institutional participants, new kinds of trading instruments and
strategies, enhanced transparency of securities transactions, expanded surveillance capabilities, globalization
of the markets, and transformation of the capital raising process. Over the years, the Commission has sought to address
the effects of these developments. Although the Commission has amended the rules several times, the primary method
of adapting the rules to changing circumstances has been through the exemptive, interpretive, and ``no-action''
letter processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that it would be useful and timely to examine comprehensively the current regulatory structure
and the concepts that underlie the Trading Practices Rules. The review is not limited, however, to these provisions,
which concentrate on persons participating in the distribution process. Other persons also may have incentives
to manipulate securities prices at the sensitive time surrounding an offering. In this Concept Release, the Commission
solicits comment on necessary or appropriate regulation to prevent manipulation during securities offerings.
Rather than proposing particular changes to the Trading Practices Rules or other provisions at this time, the Commission
is seeking comment on the scope and direction that antimanipulation regulation should take in the contemporary context.
In addition to providing views pertaining to revising and simplifying the present regulatory scheme, commenters
are invited to consider alternative approaches for applying antimanipulation principles to persons who may have
an incentive to influence artificially the market during an offering.

II. The Trading Practices Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Protecting investors from manipulated stock prices was one of the principal goals that prompted the enactment in
1934 of the Exchange Act. Since shortly after the adoption of the Exchange Act, the Commission and its staff have dealt
with issues involving manipulation in the context of securities offerings and provided formal and informal advice
regarding the scope of permissible activities during securities offerings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the Commission has noted, regulation of the market activities of parties with an interest in the outcome of an offering
presents ``intensely practical problem[s].''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Among other things, the staff has provided advice regarding the types of activities engaged in by participants in
a securities distribution that would be viewed as being undertaken for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale
of the securities by others, in violation of section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act.

For example, in response to formal and informal staff interpretations, managing underwriters followed the practice
of stopping or tapering off their trading activities when preparations for the distribution were begun; and participating
underwriters curtailed their trading when the registration statement was first filed or when they were later invited
to participate.

The Commission adopted Rules 10b&hyph;6, 10b&hyph;7, and 10b&hyph;8
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 almost four decades ago to codify the ``principles which historically have been applied in considering questions
relating to manipulative activity and stabilization in connection with a distribution.''
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 These rules provide guidance to securities professionals by removing uncertainties regarding the scope of permissible
market activities during securities offerings. They also serve a deterrence function by expressly prohibiting
manipulative behavior during offerings, and promote investor confidence in the securities markets by lessening
the ability of distribution participants to manipulate the price of an offering upward to facilitate the offering.
Moreover, as with other antimanipulation provisions, the Trading Practices Rules provide the Commission with important
enforcement tools in bringing actions against persons that have engaged in manipulative practices during securities
offerings.

A. Transformation of the Securities Markets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1950s, trading in the United States securities market was dominated by activity on the national securities
exchanges; little information was publicly available about trading in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market.
Today, however, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.'s (``NASD'') Nasdaq system is one of the world's
largest stock markets, with an average daily trading volume of 263.0 million shares, at an aggregate value in 1993
of $1.35 trillion. This compares with an average daily trading volume of 264.5 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), at an aggregate value in 1993 of $2.3 trillion.

Additionally, there has been an enormous growth in communications and information technology, which has provided
industry participants with enhanced real-time price data and news about securities and their issuers. These developments
have fostered the high level of transparency (i.e., the dissemination of trade reports and quotation information
is available to all market participants) that generally characterizes the U.S. equity markets. The availability
of quotation information helps investors to determine when and where to trade, while transaction reporting provides
an indication of the reliability of the quotations and the quality of transaction execution. A higher degree of transparency
helps investors, analysts, and other market participants to better observe and evaluate security price movements.
During a distribution, this market transparency provides greater visibility to transactions in the offered security,
enhancing the ability of investors, regulators, and others to observe unusual price movements.

Improved communications and information technology also has enabled the exchanges and the NASD to implement sophisticated
surveillance systems to detect trading abuses such as those that the Trading Practices Rules were designed to prevent.

The nature of market participants also has changed by virtue of the enhanced market role of institutional investors,
such as pension funds, mutual funds, and money managers. In recent years, many individual investors have shifted
their funds into pooled investments at a phenomenal rate, which has resulted in an enormous concentration of investment
assets in the hands of a relatively small number of market participants.

 Their economic strength allows large institutions to exert a significant influence on the structuring and pricing
of many securities offerings. Some have argued that the presence of these large institutions in securities offerings
has transferred the balance of price-setting power from the underwriters to institutional purchasers.

For example, short sales in anticipation of a secondary distribution of securities were addressed by the Commission
with the adoption in 1988 of Rule 10b&hyph;21, 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;21. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No.

The nature of participants in distributions also has changed. Today, distribution participants often are members
of complex conglomerates, with many affiliated entities in the United States and abroad. For example, not only have
broker-dealers expanded their traditional lines of business, such as retail firms that have merged with exchange
specialists,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 but banking institutions also have established broker-dealer units that are permitted to engage in the underwriting
of securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If one member of a financial conglomerate is a participant in a distribution of securities, all of the affiliates of
that entity potentially are subject to the proscriptions of Rule 10b&hyph;6, irrespective of where they are located

The securities distribution process itself has experienced significant developments. Underwriting syndicates,
where utilized, tend to be smaller, and shelf registered offerings have become a standard method of raising capital.
``Overselling'' of offerings by underwriting syndicates has become common, resulting in increased aftermarket
covering activity by underwriters, and a decrease in formal stabilization activity. Also, rights offerings by U.S.
issuers may no longer be as important for capital raising purposes as they were at the time the Trading Practices Rules
were adopted, although recently some sectors have experienced a surge in such offerings. Rights offerings continue
to be a prevalent form of offering for foreign issuers.

Moreover, a global marketplace has unfolded, characterized by a proliferation of multinational securities offerings.
Many foreign issuers now conduct concurrent offerings of their securities in the United States and abroad as well
as solely in the United States. This rise in the supply of, and demand for, multinational offerings has required careful
coordination of the interaction of the Trading Practices Rules with foreign distribution practices and regulatory
requirements.

B. Commission's Response to Market Developments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission and its staff have responded to these developments in the markets and distribution techniques through
the exemptive, no-action, interpretive, and rulemaking processes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1983, the Commission adopted comprehensive amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;6 in response to changes in the securities
markets during the quarter century following their adoption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Among other things, these amendments codified and clarified staff positions that had been developed to deal with
various transactions on a case-by-case basis.

IV. Purpose of This Release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transaction-driven nature of securities offerings means that antimanipulation rules cannot address every
situation that may arise. Although the Commission continues to be responsive to the industry's requests for interpretive
guidance and relief from the present regulations, the considerations discussed above suggest that a comprehensive
reexamination of the rules is warranted. Some securities industry participants suggest that the Trading Practice
Rules can be simplified. Others argue that the rules are unnecessarily restrictive and apply to situations where
the manipulative potential is highly attenuated. It has been suggested that alternative regulatory structures
may achieve the underlying legal and policy goals of the Exchange Act and address the issues raised by market activities
conducted during securities offerings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission is undertaking this review of antimanipulation regulation of securities offerings
with a view toward incorporating the above developments and simplifying its regulatory structure. This release
is intended to provide a forum for commenters to discuss the current structure as well as alternative approaches to
governing trading during distributions. As focus points for analyzing the pertinent issues, the following sections
identify the concepts that underlie the present regulations and raise a variety of questions on the implementation
of those concepts.

In reviewing the sections below, commenters should consider the following central themes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are classes of investors, securities, or transactions that do not need the protections of specific
rules governing manipulative conduct during offerings; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether there is a simpler structure for antimanipulation regulation with regard to offerings that will achieve
the identified goals.

V. Restrictions on Market Activities During Offerings: Rule 10b&hyph;6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rule 10b&hyph;6 Generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 10b&hyph;6 is an antimanipulation rule that is intended to prevent those persons participating in a distribution
of securities, as defined in the rule, from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in order to facilitate
the distribution, and to protect the integrity of the securities trading market as an independent pricing mechanism.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule 10b&hyph;6 accomplishes these goals by prohibiting these persons from bidding for or purchasing, or inducing
others to purchase the securities being distributed, or any security of the same class and series as the security being
distributed, or any right to purchase that security until they have completed their participation in the distribution.

Thus, the primary focuses of Rules 10b-6 are: The offerings that raise manipulative concerns, defined in the rule
as ``distributions;'' the persons who are likely to engage in manipulative activity; and the activities that could
be expected to raise or support the security's price. The rule is grounded on the view that:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person contemplating or making a distribution has an obvious incentive to artificially influence the market price
of the securities in order to facilitate the distribution or to increase its profitability. [The Commission has]
accordingly held that where a person who has a substantial interest in the success of a distribution takes active steps
to increase the price of the security, a prima facie case of manipulative purpose exists.

The rule identifies the participants in an offering who are presumed to have an incentive to engage in activities for
the purpose of facilitating the distribution; i.e., to induce the purchase of the offered securities. Various means
by which such persons could achieve this manipulative result are covered in the rule. Bids and purchases, the most
obvious means of influencing market activity, are prohibited expressly. Rule 10b-6 also broadly proscribes other
``attempt[s] to induce any person to purchase'' the securities covered by the rule. The rule then carves out of the
general prohibitions a number of activities that are considered necessary in order to conduct an offering or have
little manipulative potential.

of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in or raising the price of any [covered] security.''

This structure and the rule's terminology reflect its direct lineage to the implementation of the manipulative concepts
of Section 9(a)(2) as they had been applied to offerings. The rule also reflects the Commission's experience in combatting
manipulative behavior during offerings and provides guidelines to the investment banking community as to what types
of market activity generally would not be deemed by the Commission to be manipulative.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concept One: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation should be limited to securities offerings that give rise to a readily identifiable incentive to manipulate
the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definition of ``Distribution'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In imposing restrictions on the market activities of persons participating in a securities offering, the Commission
has focused on ``offerings of such a nature or magnitude as to require restrictions upon purchases by participants
in order to prevent manipulative practices.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has characterized such offerings as ``distributions,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and codified a definition of the term in Rule 10b&hyph;6: ``[T]he term distribution means an offering of securities,
whether or not subject to registration under the Securities Act, that is distinguished from ordinary trading transactions
by the magnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts and selling methods.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This ``functional'' definition is intended to provide a greater degree of guidance on, and certainty to, the types
of offerings that would give rise to an incentive to artificially condition the market for the offered security. The
identification of these types of situations, however, needed to remain sufficiently flexible to permit the protections
afforded by Rule 10b&hyph;6 to evolve with changes in the practices and methods of offering securities.

Accordingly, in this context the terms ``offering'' and ``distribution'' are not synonymous. See, e.g., 1982 Release,
47 FR at 11485. Generally, the term ``offering'' is used to encompass all methods by which securities are offered and
sold to investors. In Rule 10b&hyph;6, the term ``distribution'' is used to identify an offering that can be presumed
to raise an incentive to manipulate securities prices in order to facilitate the offering. See Bruns, Nordeman, 40
SEC at 660. This use of the term ``distribution'' should be distinguished from its use in the context of the Securities
Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. Collins Securities Corp., 46 SEC 20, amended, 46 SEC 213 (1975),

A ``distribution'' must have two elements: ``Magnitude'' and ``special selling efforts and selling methods.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Factors relevant to the magnitude element are: the number of shares to be registered for sale by the issuer, and the

In addition to identifying the type of offerings that may present the incentive for the particular harm that Rule 10b&hyph;6
was intended to address, it also is necessary to determine when a distribution begins and when it ends. ``A distribution
commences at the point when the incentive to engage in manipulative conduct is first present,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
48
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and a distribution is complete when the securities ``come to rest in the hands of the investing public.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
49
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule 10b&hyph;6(c)(3) specifies when a person's participation in a particular distribution is deemed to have been
completed. For example, the rule states that an underwriter's participation is over when it has distributed its portion
of the offering, including any securities of the same class that were acquired in connection with the distribution,
and when any stabilizing operations and trading restrictions in connection with the distribution have been terminated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, a person is deemed to have distributed securities acquired by him for investment. The determination
of how long securities must be held to constitute an investment will depend upon the facts and circumstances.

2. Particular Distribution Contexts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One example of significant changes in securities sales practices that have affected the administration of Rule 10b&hyph;6
pertains to the sale of securities pursuant to issuer stock purchase plans. Presently, Rule 10b&hyph;6 contains
an exception for distributions of securities by an issuer or a subsidiary of an issuer to employees or shareholders
of the issuer, its subsidiaries, or a trustee or other person acquiring such securities for the account of such employees
or shareholders pursuant to a plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On its face, this exception applies irrespective of the magnitude of the offering or the nature of the selling efforts.
Traditionally, stock purchase plans were seen as mechanisms by which employees and shareholders, i.e., persons
having a significant relationship with the issuer, could increase their holdings, rather than as major capital-raising
vehicles. These distributions have not been viewed as presenting the same incentives for manipulation by the issuer
as in other distributions because of the limited nature of the sales, as well as the relationship between the issuer
and plan participants.

Today, however, issuer plans often are available not only to employees and shareholders, but also to outside directors,
franchisees, customers, and others having varying relationships with the issuer. Moreover, plan distributions
may be used as significant capital-raising mechanisms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
54
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the case of plans open to persons other than shareholders or employees, sales of a security to the plan do not qualify
for the Paragraph (e) exception. As a result, absent an exemption from Rule 10b&hyph;6, issuers and other distribution
participants are required to comply with Rule 10b&hyph;6. Even with respect to plans that qualify for the Paragraph
(e) exception, the more recent use of such plans to broadly distribute the issuer's securities may not have been contemplated
by the Commission when Paragraph (e) was adopted.

Should the Commission continue to define the term ``distribution,'' and if so, should the Commission continue to
define the term based on the ``magnitude of the offering'' and the presence of ``special selling efforts and selling
methods''? If so, are there identifiable factors that can be used to determine whether an offering satisfies these
criteria? Commenters may wish to suggest criteria that distinguish ``distributions'' from ``ordinary trading
transactions.''

Concept Two: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation should be limited to those persons who have a readily identifiable incentive to manipulate the market
during an offering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 10b&hyph;6 applies to the following persons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Issuers and selling shareholders;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Underwriters and prospective underwriters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Brokers, dealers, and other persons that have agreed to participate or are participating in the distribution;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ``Affiliated purchasers'' of the foregoing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
63
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, the prohibitions of the rule have been considered applicable to any other person who has a material financial
interest in the success of the distribution which would provide that person with an incentive to condition the market
to facilitate the distribution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except for the duration of the distribution period in Paragraph (c)(3), the rule applies equally to each category
of distribution participant; yet the incentives of each to facilitate a distribution may differ substantially,
reflecting very different risk and reward profiles. Moreover, those incentives may vary at different times in the
distribution process.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In best efforts offerings and prior to the pricing of a firm commitment offering, issuers and selling shareholders
have a clear incentive to manipulate the price of the securities to be distributed. A very small change in the market
price of a security, which in some circumstances may be accomplished at relatively little expense, can result in a
substantial increase in offering proceeds, particularly when a large number of shares are to be sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A firm commitment underwriting typically involves a group of underwriters, represented by one or more managing underwriters,
an underwriting group, and a number of ``selling group'' members. The financial risk of failure and the concomitant
incentive to manipulate largely shifts to the underwriters once the underwriting agreement with the issuer is signed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
65
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Within the underwriting group, the incentives may vary in proportion to the amount of the underwriting commitment
and the particular role of the underwriter in the offering. For example, a managing underwriter may have a larger reputational
stake in the success of an offering and an ongoing business relationship with the issuer that may align its interests
more closely with the issuer as compared with other members of the underwriting syndicate. Selling group members
participate in the sale of the offered security, but do not assume any underwriting risk. Selling group members pay
for only the amount of securities necessary to satisfy orders obtained from customers; their risk is limited to the
extent that their customers renege.

The contractual commitment typically is executed shortly (usually less than one day) before the commencement of
sales of the securities. The commitment also typically is subject to ``market out'' clauses that permit the underwriters
to avoid the risk of proceeding with the underwriting in the event of certain specified contingencies.

The restrictions of Rule 10b&hyph;6 also extend to ``affiliated purchasers'' of distribution participants, i.e.,
persons that have relationships with distribution participants as well as the incentive and ability to facilitate
a distribution of securities.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 Affiliated purchasers include persons acting in concert with a distribution participant in connection with the
acquisition or distribution of securities, and affiliates that, directly or indirectly, control the purchases
of a distribution participant, or whose purchasers are controlled by or are under common control with a distribution
participant (e.g., decisional officers of the issuer who participate directly or indirectly in the recommendation
of, determination to proceed with, or implementation of, a distribution). The increasingly complex structure of
financial and other conglomerates
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 suggests that the ``affiliated purchaser'' definition may require revision.

Concept Three: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation should be limited to market activity that would improperly affect the price of, or create the appearance
of excessive trading in, the offered security, but should not unduly restrain legitimate market and business practices.

1. Bids, Purchases, and Inducements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been said on a number of occasions that the goal of regulating the activities of distribution participants is
to ``prevent participants in a distribution from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in distribution''
and to ``protect the integrity of the securities trading market as an independent pricing mechanism during the distribution
period.''
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 To prohibit all activity of distribution participants, however, would result in a distorted market simply by virtue
of curtailing ``normal'' market activity of distribution participants during the distribution period. Accordingly,
regulation should focus upon market activities by distribution participants (and their affiliated purchasers)
that improperly would directly or indirectly raise or maintain the price of the offered security or create the appearance
of active trading in the security.

 These terms have been interpreted to cover a broad range of transactions. For example, ``bid'' includes priced quotations,
unpriced indications of interest in purchasing a security, public announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer,

2. Cooling-off Periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some activities may present greater manipulative concerns depending upon when they occur during the distribution
process. The most critical period of the offering is the period beginning immediately before pricing and continuing
until the securities have come to rest in the hands of investors (i.e., when the distribution has ended). Thus, Rule
10b&hyph;6 has incorporated the concept of ``cooling-off periods.'' Generally, distribution participants and
their affiliated purchasers may continue their trading and other market activities in the covered securities until
the applicable cooling-off period begins, at which point they must suspend such activity until the termination of
the distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bases for applying cooling-off periods are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Restrictions on bids and purchases during the entire distribution period could unnecessarily distort the market
for the offered security; and (2) The effects on the offered security's price resulting from distribution participants'
market activities should dissipate within a period of time. The cooling-off periods thus are intended to permit supply
and demand forces independent of the market activities of persons with manipulative incentives to establish the
market price of the covered securities at the time the offering is priced and when they are being sold to investors.
The cooling-off periods also provide guidance to distribution participants as to what period of time is required
between the cessation of their market activities (which may have increased or maintained the market price of, or involved
substantial trading activity in, the covered securities) and sales to investors.

 In this context, rather than requiring individual broker-dealers or syndicate managers to determine when to taper
off and cease their market activities, the rule supplies uniform guidance.

Rule 10b&hyph;6 uses market-related criteria to fix the lengths of the cooling-off periods, which are two, five,
and nine business days prior to the ``commencement of offers and sales'' in the distribution. For stock with a minimum
share price of $5.00 and a public float of at least 400,000 shares (``$5/400,000 Share Test''), the cooling-off period
is two business days. For all other securities, the cooling-off period is nine business days. A minimum price per share
requirement was viewed as an appropriate criterion in light of the generally greater volatility of low-priced stocks,
while a public float standard was viewed as providing a reasonable indication of the depth and liquidity of the market
for a security.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Solicited principal and solicited brokerage transactions by distribution participants are subject to the two and
nine business day cooling-off periods. A five business day cooling-off period applies to the exercise of standardized
call options on securities satisfying the $5/400,000 Share Test, if such options were acquired after the person exercising
the option became a distribution participant. This cooling-off period is intended to minimize the probability that
purchases of the underlying security resulting from options exercises would occur during the two business day cooling-off
period. No cooling-off period is available for inducements to purchase. No cooling-off period is applied to unsolicited
principal transactions: the restriction on such activity begins as of the commencement of offers or sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is aware of the perception that by curtailing distribution participant activity, even with the availability
of cooling-off periods, the rule can affect adversely the ``normal'' trading market for a security. Because of this
concern, the Commission recently adopted an exception to Rule 10b&hyph;6 and a companion Rule 10b&hyph;6A permitting
``passive market making'' (i.e., transactions that follow, but do not lead, the market) by Nasdaq market makers participating
in distributions of Nasdaq securities satisfying the $5/400,000 Share Test.

Concept Four: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation should be limited to securities whose prices may significantly affect the market's evaluation of a security
in distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of Rule 10b&hyph;6 apply to the security being distributed, any security of the ``same class and series''
as that security, and ``any right to purchase'' any such security.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
82
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule also deems a distribution of a security that is ``immediately exchangeable for or convertible into'' another
security, or that entitles the holder immediately to acquire another security, to include a distribution of such
other security, thereby prohibiting bids for or purchases of the underlying security as well as the security in distribution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
83
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule covers these securities because they bear a relationship to the securities in distribution such that distribution
participants may be tempted to manipulate these related securities to facilitate the distribution.

Paragraph (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relationship between the securities to be distributed and those to be purchased may be based on their similar terms
or on a mathematical relationship conferred, for example, by a right to convert or exchange one security for the other.
Bids for or purchases of related securities may result in price changes that render them expensive relative to the
security in distribution. The disparate prices may prompt arbitrage transactions by other market participants
involving the sale of the related security and the purchase (and possible upward effect on the price) of the security
in distribution. Purchases of a related security by distribution participants also may be used to induce unrelated
market professionals to purchase the security in distribution as a hedge. For example, large purchases of standardized
call options are likely to force options market makers (who have sold the options) to purchase the underlying common
stock to hedge their risk. A price increase in a related security also may indicate to a potential investor that the
security in distribution is under-priced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``same class and series'' language has been construed broadly to encompass securities that are sufficiently
similar in their terms to the security in distribution to raise the possibility that bids for or purchases of the outstanding
security might be utilized to facilitate the distribution, even though there is no inherent mathematical relationship
between the prices of the securities.

``Same class and series'' questions have arisen most frequently with regard to debt securities. See Letter regarding
Gamble Skogmo, Inc. (January 11, 1974) (available on LEXIS), in which the staff took a no-action position to permit
bids for or purchases of the issuer's outstanding debt securities that varied by at least 1% in coupon interest rate
and by at least ten years in maturity from those of the debt securities being distributed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transactions in nonconvertible debt securities or nonconvertible preferred securities where both the nonconvertible
securities being distributed and those to be purchased have been rated investment grade by at least one nationally
recognized statistical rating organization (``NRSRO'') are excepted from Rule 10b&hyph;6. Paragraph (a)(4)(xiii).
The exception is premised on the fungibility of investment grade issues (i.e., that securities with similar terms
will trade on rating and yield rather than issuer identification). Prices of high-yield debt securities, on the other
hand, are presumed to be influenced by issuer-specific information as well as interest rates. Cf. Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 33327 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 67878.

 The scope of the rule is limited, however, and does not encompass a wide variety of derivative securities and instruments
developed in recent years that do not give the holder the right to acquire another security. Nonetheless, these instruments
derive their value in whole or in part from an equity security or from a group of equity securities, and thus potentially
raise the same manipulative concerns underlying Rule 10b&hyph;6. For example, cash-settled index-related securities
and instruments, such as narrow-based index options, have a value that may be derived in significant part from a component
security. Similarly, the sale of a put option
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
86
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is closely analogous in terms of its potential impact on the underlying security as a purchase of a call option, but
it is not a right to purchase.

Rule 10b&hyph;6 has been interpreted to cover sales of put options on a security in distribution on the theory that

Question 1.23. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Are there objective standards or quantitative models for identifying the securities that should or should not be
covered? Are factors other than stated interest rates and maturities relevant to the ``same class and series'' analysis,
such as differences in ratings, rankings (senior versus subordinated), and redemption features? Commenters favoring
an objective approach may wish to suggest ``bright line'' factors, the presence or absence of which would establish
conclusively that two securities are not of the same class and series.

Question 1.24.

Should the ``right to purchase'' concept be retained, or should it be replaced with a ``price-related security''
concept that would include all securities having a significant price relationship with the security in distribution?
Commenters favoring such an approach should address how ``price-related securities'' should be defined and how
to exclude securities or other instruments whose prices have a highly attenuated economic relationship to and, therefore,
little potential impact upon the security in distribution.

Stabilization of offerings should be restricted in order to minimize its manipulative impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Current Regulatory Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The express purpose of stabilization is to affect a security's price. Therefore, during securities offerings, where
the underwriter has the purpose to induce others to buy the offered security, stabilization is a form of manipulation.
As a rationale for permitting stabilization through regulation, the Commission pointed to the significant risks
to which underwriters are subject in firm commitment underwritings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
87
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In Rule 10b&hyph;7, the Commission codified previously articulated guidelines for determining which transactions
effected to peg, fix, or stabilize the price of a security constitute lawful stabilization as a means to facilitate
the placement of securities in an orderly manner, and which transactions constitute unlawful manipulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 10b&hyph;7 applies to ``any person who, either alone or with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly,
stabilizes the price of a security to facilitate an offering of any security.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
88
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Stabilizing transactions are those involving ``the placing of any bid, or the effecting of any purchase, for the purpose
of pegging, fixing or stabilizing the price of any security.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
89
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To prevent stabilizing activities from improperly affecting the market for a security, Rule 10b&hyph;7 prohibits
certain specific activities, including bids or purchases not necessary for the purpose of preventing or retarding
a decline in the open market price of the security, and stabilizing at a price resulting from unlawful activity. The
rule establishes the price level at which a stabilizing bid may be entered, and rules of priority for the execution
of independent bids at times when a stabilizing bid has been entered. In addition, the rule regulates the number of
stabilizing bids that an underwriting syndicate may enter in any one market at any one time, and the entry of stabilizing
bids on markets other than the principal market for the security being stabilized. The rule also requires that notice
be given that the market will be or is being stabilized, and requires a person effecting stabilizing transactions
to keep the information and make the notification required by Rule 17a&hyph;2 under the Exchange Act.

is conducted? How frequently and under what circumstances are offerings stabilized (as opposed to reserving the

B. Aftermarket Bids and Purchases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Underwriters engage in numerous activities in the ``aftermarket'' of the offered security, i.e., the period following
the cessation of sales efforts in the offering. In purpose or effect, these activities may support, or even raise,
the market price of the security, and can have the effect of ``stabilizing'' the security's price.

A significant volume of trading frequently occurs in the days immediately following the end of the sales of the offered
securities. Three significant activities by persons who participated in the distribution often occur during this
period: market making; purchases of the offered security to cover a syndicate short position; and ``penalty bids.''
Underwriters, particularly managing underwriters, generally become market makers in the security (or resume market
making if it was suspended during the offering). Underwriters may have ``oversold'' the offering in order to compensate
for cancellations and to create aftermarket buying power against anticipated selling pressure immediately following
the offering.

 Issuers sometimes grant an overallotment option (so-called ``Green Shoe'' option) to underwriters to purchase
securities in addition to the amount that the syndicate is committed to purchase from the issuer.

as ``flipping,'' has become common. See, e.g., Peers, Wall Street Plans to Crack Down on IPO 'Flippers,' Wall St. J.,
December 29, 1993, at C1. It appears to be a longstanding phenomenon of offerings.

VII. Rights Offerings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concept Six: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation should be limited to rights offerings that raise a readily identifiable incentive to manipulate the market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rights offerings are a means of raising capital whereby, for a limited period of time, issuers offer existing security
holders the opportunity to purchase new securities, generally at a discount to the market price of the security underlying
the rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the structure differs significantly from that of a traditional offering of equity or debt securities, rights
offerings involve different risks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
97
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For instance, a decline in the market price during the often lengthy period during which rights may be exercised (``rights
exercise period'') can affect the success of the offering. For this reason, issuers often retain underwriters who
assume the risk of failure of the offering, i.e., that a substantial amount of rights will remain unexercised at the
end of the rights exercise period.

Broker-dealers often are employed by issuers in one of, or some hybrid of, two methods to reduce market risk during
the rights exercise period. The first method is the so-called ``Shields Plan,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
98
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is used when the underwriters (typically a syndicate of underwriters) enter into a standby arrangement with
the issuer, thereby committing to purchase all shares left unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights exercise
period. During the rights exercise period, the underwriters will seek to offset the risk of purchasing the shares
representing unexercised rights by purchasing rights, exercising them, and selling the securities acquired. The
underwriters also may effect short sales of the underlying security and then purchase rights to cover this short position.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the issuer retains a securities dealer to act as dealer-manager of the offering, although there is no standby commitment
to purchase unsubscribed shares.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where rights are transferable, Shields Plan-type activities may be used in this type of arrangement to increase the
amount of rights exercised, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the soliciting dealers sell short the securities being offered and purchase rights and exercise them to cover their
short positions. Accordingly, although the dealer-manager may facilitate the exercise of rights and thus the distribution
of the underlying securities, the risk of failure remains with the issuer.

Adopted by the Commission in 1955, Rule 10b&hyph;8 represented a codification of prior administrative practice
regarding rights offerings by permitting purchases of rights and other activities designed to reduce the risk of
raising capital through rights offerings, albeit subject to limitations consistent with the goals of Rule 10b&hyph;6
(i.e., to restrict activities by persons participating in the rights offering which might artificially affect the
price of the rights or the underlying security).

Rule 10b&hyph;8 applies to any person participating in a rights distribution, including the issuer, underwriter,
dealer-manager, and soliciting dealers. The rule excludes from its coverage a person whose activities consist solely
of receiving compensation from the issuer of rights for obtaining exercises of rights by security holders to whom
they were originally issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, certain persons or entities that are not brokers or dealers have served as standby purchasers in rights
offerings in order to increase their ownership in the issuer's securities. Unlike standby underwriters who purchase
rights to reduce their position risk, purchases of rights by such persons are made to acquire or increase a position
in the underlying security. These latter standby purchasers are not covered by Rule 10b&hyph;8. See, e.g., Letter
regarding Elron Electronic Industries Ltd. (March 19, 1990), [1990&hyph;1991] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;79,656.

In 1983, the rule was amended to include within its scope convertible securities called for redemption pursuant to
a standby underwriting agreement. Generally, calls for redemption contain features similar to rights offerings,
namely, that a standby underwriter seeks to minimize its exposure to position risk during the redemption period.
In 1993, the rule was amended to except certain rights offerings of foreign securities made exclusively in the United
States to ``qualified institutional buyers,'' as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act. See Rule 144A Release.

 The sales price is based upon the last sale price by the manager of the distribution or by a price set by that manager.
Such price may be set from time to time, but an offering price set in any day may not be increased more than once during
such day. The rule's restrictions on sales are designed to address the relationship that exists between the rights
and the underlying security, and are intended to prevent distribution participants from offering the underlying
security at steadily increasing prices, which could affect the market price of the underlying security and enhance
the attractiveness of the rights. Because a distribution participant may buy rights to the extent such rights are
needed to acquire securities that were previously sold, the sales price restriction on the underlying security may
limit the size of the participant's short position, in turn controlling that participant's rights purchasing activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Because purchases of rights may have the effect of increasing the price of the underlying security (e.g., non-distribution
participant arbitrage sellers of rights would hedge by purchasing the underlying security), restrictions on the
price at which the underlying security may be sold reduces any indirect effect on the underlying security through
the purchase of rights. Although the rule does not regulate directly the size of the short position in the underlying
security, it may do so indirectly to the extent that it becomes economically impractical for a participant in the rights
offering to sell the underlying security at prices below the total acquisition cost of the rights plus the exercise
price.

Concept Seven:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where necessary or appropriate, regulation should address the activities of persons other than distribution participants
who have substantial incentives to manipulate security prices during offerings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Trading Practices Rules address the manipulative activities of distribution participants and their affiliated
purchasers. However, other parties also may have substantial incentives to manipulate the price of a security around
the time of a securities offering. The difficulty lies in drawing clear lines that appropriately address manipulation
practices but that do not interfere with legitimate market and business activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One context that has been addressed is sales of securities prior to the pricing of an offering. The Commission has applied
fundamental manipulation concepts to this activity: ``Where * * * those who have a substantial interest in the establishment
of lower market prices take active steps to accomplish their objective, a finding of manipulative purpose is warranted''
under Exchange act sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Securities Act Section 17(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the Commission views short selling in anticipation of a public offering and the subsequent covering
of those short sales with the offered securities as a manipulative activity. Such short sales are detrimental to the
capital formation process, because the decreased price resulting from those sales deprives the issuer of offering
proceeds that otherwise would have been realized had the market not been subject to such activity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
111
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Persons who sell short and cover their sales out of a public offering are not subject to the usual market risk associated
with short sales, because they have access to a pool of securities obtainable from distribution participants at a
fixed, and generally lower, price. It is this lower risk that can provide an incentive for manipulative short selling.
The Commission adopted Rule 10b&hyph;21 in 1988 to prohibit this type of short selling and covering.

Concept Eight:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consistent with the protection of United States investors, regulation of offerings should avoid conflicts with
global distribution practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly after adoption of the Trading Practices Rules, the Commission took the position that, with respect to multinational
offerings of securities occurring in whole or in part in the United States, the Trading Practices Rules apply to all
distribution participants and their affiliated purchasers, wherever they are located or effect transactions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
114
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The basis for this position is that transactions occurring in a foreign jurisdiction can affect the market for the
security being distributed in the United States, and such activity might result in the harm that Rule 10b&hyph;6 was
designed to prevent (i.e., the creation of artificial prices by persons participating in the distribution).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
115
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the world's securities markets have become increasingly interconnected and, in particular, as multinational
offerings have become more common, market participants have asserted that the extraterritorial effects of the Trading
Practices Rules disrupt foreign distribution participants' normal market practices and may discourage some offerings
from being made in the United States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
116
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

in their home jurisdictions.

The Commission has addressed the international effects of these rules by providing relief in appropriate contexts
on an individual and class basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
118
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has applied the Trading Practices Rules in a manner intended to limit disruption in the home country
market but in the context of its duty to protect U.S. investors from manipulative offering practices. Relief has been
based on a variety of factors: The depth of the market for a foreign security; the availability of transaction information
to the Commission; information sharing arrangements with foreign regulators; comparable foreign regulation;
the significance of a particular market for price discovery; disclosure of foreign market practices and transactions;
and the characteristics of the market for the security in the United States. In the case of rights offerings, which
are quite common in foreign jurisdictions, the lengthy rights exercise periods and the amount of the discount between
the rights exercise price and the price of the underlying security also have been viewed as important factors in fashioning
relief.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering the concepts noted above and the issues that they raise, some commenters may believe that a different
construct, rather than amendments to the current rules, would provide a more appropriate means of protecting investors
from manipulation during securities offerings. In assessing the general proposition of how and whether market activities
during distributions should be regulated, commenters are requested to consider the following:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Question 6.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
How have changes in the securities markets and securities offering practices affected the need for some form of regulation
of trading and similar activities during offerings of securities? What are the costs and benefits of any continued
regulation of these activities? If regulation continues to be necessary or appropriate, what form should such regulation
take? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, commenters are invited to suggest and describe alternatives to the current system, and may wish to
consider the approaches described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Safe Harbor Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this approach, if certain conditions were satisfied, a ``safe harbor'' from the antimanipulation provisions
of sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) and Rule 10b&hyph;5 thereunder would be available. For example, Rule 10b&hyph;18 under
the Exchange Act provides a safe harbor from these provisions for certain bids or purchases made by an issuer or its
affiliated purchasers. For that rule's safe harbor to apply, the issuer or its affiliated purchasers must satisfy
conditions relating to the time, price, amount, and method of purchasing the issuer's security. Commenters should
consider whether it would be appropriate, and practical, to adopt a safe harbor approach in lieu of, or as a supplement
to, the Trading Practices Rules. Because transactions within any such safe harbor still could have a manipulative
impact, the safe harbor would be unavailable where the transactions were made with manipulative or fraudulent intent.

B. Evidentiary Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Trading Practices Rules, it is unlawful for a distribution participant to bid for or purchase the securities
that are the subject of a distribution (or related securities) until his or her participation is completed, absent
an exception or exemption. Some market participants have voiced concerns that certain violations of Rule 10b&hyph;6
are ``inadvertent'' or ``technical'' in nature and do not evince an intent to artificially influence the price of
a security in distribution. A possible alternative would be to adopt a presumption that a distribution participant
or its affiliated purchaser who engages in proscribed activity during a distribution has done so with manipulative
intent, and place the burden on that person to prove that the conduct was not done with manipulative intent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Various sections of the Exchange Act authorize the Commission to prohibit activities that it deems or defines to be
manipulative.

D. ALI Code Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1978, the American Law Institute (``ALI'') proposed a comprehensive codification of the federal securities laws
(``ALI Code'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
125
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ALI Code retains many of the fundamental concepts of Rules 10b&hyph;6 and 10b&hyph;7.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
126
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, the ALI Code would codify the basic principles of Rule 10b&hyph;6, but leave it to successor rules to provide
the details and exemptions. The code does not recommend the repeal of any of the exceptions in Rule 10b&hyph;6. Additionally,
the proposed definition of ``distribution'' would permit the Commission to define the term in light of a number of
factors, including the size of the offering, number of sellers and buyers, selling methods, characteristics of the
market used, and compensation.

E. Stabilization Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An alternative regulatory framework for stabilization is provided by the rules of the United Kingdom Securities
and Investments Board (``SIB Rules'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
130
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The SIB Rules provide a safe harbor from charges of violating U.K. antimanipulation law only to the ``stabilizing
manager,'' who is analogous to the U.S. managing underwriter. The other syndicate members are neither protected
nor restricted by the SIB Rules. The stabilizing manager may bid for or purchase the offered security for the purpose
of ``stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the security being offered'' during the ``stabilizing period,''
which can run to the 60th day after the date of allotment made to subscribers and purchasers, potentially much longer
than the period covered by Rule 10b&hyph;7.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIB Rules are more flexible than Rule 10b&hyph;7 in permitting bids and purchases to closely follow the market,
moving up or down, at or below the initial stabilizing price. In addition, the bid may be raised to the last independent
sale price even if that price is higher than the initial stabilizing bid. As under Rule 10b&hyph;7, however, no stabilizing
price may exceed the offering price. The stabilizing manager also is permitted to overallot the offered securities
to ``subscribers or purchasers'' or sell short the securities to facilitate its subsequent stabilizing purchases.
Moreover, the SIB Rules permit the stabilizing manager to buy in the market to cover a syndicate short position, and
to cover such short position without regard to the general price limits otherwise imposed on stabilizing transactions.

rules.

in connection with distributions generally and rights offerings specifically?

Following the 1929 stock market crash and amid public furor concerning financial intermediaries that had engaged
in flagrant manipulation in the securities markets, Congress enacted the Exchange Act to put an end to the practices
that it found had contributed to the economic problems facing the Nation.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In drafting the legislation, Congress determined that the available common law remedies for fraud were inadequate
to combat manipulation in the securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Because Congress recognized that market manipulation can assume many forms, it did not define the term in the Exchange
Act or elsewhere. Congress intended the Exchange Act to outlaw every ``device used to persuade the public that activity
in a security is the reflection of a genuine demand instead of a mirage.''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In a number of provisions, the Commission is given authority to define manipulative practices and adopt rules to proscribe
and prevent such conduct.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 As the Commission has stated:

Congressional findings leading to the enactment of the Exchange Act pointed to widespread manipulation and fraud
by brokers, dealers, and other members of the financial industry. One of the ``chief evils'' was the operation of ``pools,''
which were agreements among several persons to trade actively in a security, generally to raise the price of a security
by concerted activity, in order to sell their holdings at a profit to the public, which is attracted by the activity
or by information disseminated about the stock. Report to the Secretary of Commerce, Staff of Senate Committee on
Stock Exchange Regulation, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1934); S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1934). See, e.g.,

Prior to enacting the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq., and the Exchange Act, the federal government could
only combat securities fraud and manipulation by criminal prosecution for violation of the mail fraud statute, 18
U.S.C. 1341, or for conspiring to violate it, 18 U.S.C. 371. For example, in

misrepresentation and ``unfair dealing'' and thus violated the mail fraud statute. See also Hearings before Comm.

When investors and prospective investors see activity, they are entitled to assume that it is real activity. They
are also entitled to assume that the prices that they pay and receive are determined by the unimpeded interaction of
real supply and real demand so that those prices are the collective marketplace judgment that they purport to be. Manipulations
frustrate these expectations. They substitute fiction for fact.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;The vice is
that the market has been distorted and made into 'a stage-managed performance.'

The provisions of Section 9(a) were designed to ``purge the securities exchanges of those practices which have prevented
them from fulfilling their primary function of furnishing open markets for securities where supply and demand may
freely meet at prices uninfluenced by manipulation or control.''
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Congress explicitly prohibited certain transactions when the purpose was to ``create a false or misleading appearance
of active trading'' or a ``false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for an exchange-registered security.''
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Congress included a general anti-manipulation provision, Section 9(a)(2),

 which has been termed the ``heart'' of the Exchange Act.

Section 10 of the Exchange Act addresses the ``regulation of the use of manipulative and deceptive devices.'' Section
10(a) provides the Commission with plenary authority to regulate short sales in exchange-registered securities.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Section 10(b) makes unlawful the use or employment of ``any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance'' in
contravention of Commission rules adopted pursuant to that section.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 In 1942, the Commission adopted Rule 10b&hyph;5, which prohibits any person from using any device, scheme, or artifice
to defraud any person, making any untrue material statement or any material omission, or engaging in any fraudulent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31520 (November 24, 1992), 57 FR 57397. The Commission proposed to rescind
Rule 10b&hyph;2 in view of the significant changes that have occurred in the securities markets since its adoption
and duplicative coverage of other antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the federal securities laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

10539 (December 6, 1973), 38 FR 3434; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8930 (July 13, 1970), 35 FR 11410. On three
separate occasions, the Commission proposed Rule 13e&hyph;2 (predecessor of Rule 10b&hyph;18) to regulate purchase
of certain classes of common stock and preferred stock by or for the issuer, any affiliate of the issuer, or any ``affiliated
purchaser,'' through disclosure requirements and substantive purchasing limitations imposed on an issuer and
on any affiliated purchaser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19244 (November 17, 1982), 47 FR 53333. The Commission adopted Rule 10b&hyph;18
to provide a safe harbor from liability from manipulation in connection with purchases by an issuer and certain related
persons of the issuer's common stock.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 10636 (February 11, 1974), 39 FR 7806. The Commission proposed Rule 10b&hyph;21
to deter manipulative short selling in connection with an underwritten offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11328 (April 2, 1975), 40 FR 16090. The Commission reproposed a version of Rule
10b&hyph;21 which would deter manipulative short selling prior to underwritten offerings by limiting the ability
of short sellers to make covering purchases from certain persons within certain periods during an underwriting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13092 (December 21, 1976), 41 FR 56542. The Commission proposed an alternative
version of Rule 10b&hyph;21 that focused on short selling itself, rather than on covering purchases, and would regulate
short sales from the preoffering period until the end of the post-offering stabilization arrangements through the
use of a ``tick test.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24485 (May 20, 1987), 52 FR 19885. Pursuant to a petition filed by the NASD, the
Commission reproposed Rule 10b&hyph;21 to prohibit a person who effects short sales of an equity security during
the period between the filing of a registration statement relating to the same class of equity securities and the commencement
of the distribution of such equity securities, from covering such short sales with securities purchased from an underwriter
or other broker-dealer participating in the offering of such securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33702 (March 2, 1994), 59 FR 10984. The Commission adopted Rule 10b&hyph;21

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 ATF is proposing to amend trade practice regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tied-house, exclusive outlets, commercial bribery, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consignment sales by adding standards for enforcing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``exclusion'' element where appropriate and by revising other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as the result of an agency review and an industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition. Under the FAA Act, ``exclusion, in whole or in part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, sold or offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for sale by other persons'' is a necessary element of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of the tied-house, exclusive outlets or commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bribery provisions. Recent court rulings have raised questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning ATF's traditional interpretation of the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``exclusion''. ATF intends to use rulemaking to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) promulgate a framework for establishing ``exclusion,'' (2) identify promotional practices which result in
retailer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, (3) identify promotional practices which result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion under the Act, and (4) identify those practices for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which there is no likelihood that exclusion will result and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Bureau will not take action (safe harbors). Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory amendments are also made as a result of an ATF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of the regulations and an industry petition submitted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Alcohol Administration Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Alcohol Administration Act (hereinafter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as FAA Act or Act) provides for Federal regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry. The FAA Act contains

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular restrictions that are unique to the alcoholic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beverage industry and reflects Congress' concern with a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of trade practices and abuses that took place before, during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and immediately after Prohibition. This notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking focuses on four parts of the statute, Exclusive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outlet (27 U.S.C. 205(a)), Tied-House (27 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
205(b)), Commercial Bribery (27 U.S.C. 205(c)), and Consignment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sales (27 U.S.C. 205(d)). The supplementary information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided into two sections. The first section deals with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject of exclusion, and the second section covers other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes proposed as a result of an internal review of trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice regulations and an industry petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One element which is necessary for these practices to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in violation of Federal law is ``exclusion, in whole or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part, of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, sold or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered for sale by other persons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although exclusion is not defined in the FAA Act or in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current implementing regulations at 27 CFR parts 6, 8 and 10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has, in the past, held that ``exclusion in part'' includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causing retailers to purchase less of a competing brand than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they otherwise would have bought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a recent decision, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway Associates, Inc., et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Fedway),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 976 F.2d 1416 (DC Cir. 1992) the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held that Congress had intended something more than just a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retailer purchasing less of a competing brand than it otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have and for a violation to occur there must also be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tie or link between a supplier and retailer that at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatens the retailer's independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court based this conclusion on several points. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
court said ``exclusion'' means to exclude a rival product from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the marketplace by some direct action of the violator. Merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking some action which influences a retailer not to purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rival product is not exclusion under the Act if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retailer's response is the result of a free economic choice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation of exclusion as meaning the shutting out or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expelling of a rival's product, according to the court, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with conduct addressed by the Act such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tied-house, commercial bribery and exclusive outlets. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broader interpretation would, in the view of the court, likely

result in restriction of pro-competitive activities.

The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court was concerned that ATF enforcement actions could hinder legitimate competitive activities. Consequently,
the opinion states that if ATF suspects a particular practice places retailer independence at risk then the agency
must provide substantial support backing up its suspicion. This substantial support is especially necessary where
the anticompetitive nature of the means to induce is ``nowhere apparent on its face.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factual or substantive proof is necessary, the court stated, to ensure that the Government does not take an overly-broad
enforcement posture in its efforts to prevent potential threats to retailer independence and risk outlawing conduct
that fosters a competitive alcohol market. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proceeding, the court held this factual basis was not met because the only datum or evidence presented was the fact
that certain retailers purchased less of a rival product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the court offered the following guidance about this statutory element:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress, we are satisfied, used ``exclusion'' to indicate placement of retailer independence at risk by means of
a ``tie'' or ``link'' between the wholesaler and the retailer or by any other means of wholesaler control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[We demand] a factual showing that retailer independence is potentially threatened. .&blank;.&blank;.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[ATF should] take reasonable account of both policy interests underlying the [trade practice] provisions. .&blank;.&blank;.
that the alcohol industry requires special oversight and regulation. .&blank;.&blank;. and the value of pro-competitive
wholesale promotions. This value derives not only from the traditional benefits of competition in terms of lower
prices and improved quality, but also .&blank;.&blank;. from the fact that a competitive alcohol market helps deter
the formation of a corrupt black market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in arriving at a reasonable interpretation of ``exclusion''.&blank;.&blank;. the Bureau must take care
to distinguish rationally between those promotions it decides are lawful and those it decides are not.

Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments and additions to the regulations on the subject of exclusion follow a framework which ATF
believes is consistent with the statutory interpretation of exclusion adopted by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court as well as similar concerns previously raised in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The courts in both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foremost
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 found that ``exclusion'' as used in the FAA Act cannot occur without a relationship or arrangement between the industry
member and the retailer which directly or indirectly threatens the retailer's independence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF proposes to amend regulatory parts of title 27 CFR relating to exclusive outlet (part 8), tied-house (part 6),
and commercial bribery (part 10), by adding new subparts on exclusion. Even though the exclusive outlet provision
was not involved in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foremost
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decisions, the provision is impacted by the decisions since the provision requires the showing of exclusion in order
for a violation to arise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF proposes to describe exclusion, in whole or in part, of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages sold or offered
for sale by others as occurring (1) when a practice places retailer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between
the industry member and retailer or by any other means of industry control over the retailer, and (2) such a practice
by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, results in the retailer purchasing less
that it otherwise would have of a competitor's product. The proposed regulations will contain a set of criteria by
which ATF will determine the existence of the first element. These criteria include the duration of the practice or
promotion, the degree to which a practice involves an industry member in the day-to-day operations of a retailer,
and, in some cases, the non-discrimination feature of the practice where it is available to all retailers. Exclusion
will exist when ATF can establish the presence of both of these elements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, ATF proposes to identify certain practices which it believes, by their very existence, place retailer
independence at risk. When such practices are undertaken, ATF would determine through the course of an investigation
whether the other exclusionary element set forth above is present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, ATF proposes to revise and consolidate several of the provisions contained in Subpart D of Part 6 of the
current regulations which find that certain practices will not result in exclusion under the FAA Act (that is, safe
harbors). The classification of these practices is intended to provide guidance to the regulated industry so that
legitimate product marketing programs can be developed without the uncertainty of a potential Federal enforcement
action. Legitimate product marketing encourages competition, by large and small businesses alike, on the basis
of price, product quality and service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF emphasizes that the revision of the trade practices regulations is an ongoing process. Any interested person
may petition for a rule change, under 27 CFR 71.41(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exclusive Outlet
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 105(a) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or otherwise, any retailer
engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages to purchase any such product from such person to the exclusion in whole or
in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, provided
one of the three interstate or foreign commerce jurisdictional clauses is met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Retailer independence is threatened in an exclusive outlet arrangement when the ability of the retailer to decide
which brands of alcoholic beverages to purchase is restricted or impeded. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 context, the question is whether any restriction negates the retailer's free economic choice or has been imposed
by the industry member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that regard, the proposed regulations identify two practices that clearly result in exclusion under section 105(a)
of the Act. The first practice involves purchases of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages by a retailer as a result,
directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of physical or economic harm by the selling industry member. The second practice
involves contracts between an industry member and a retailer which require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits,
wine or malt beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer from purchasing, in whole or
in part, such products from another industry member. In both situations, exclusion of a competitor's products results
directly from the arrangement or the contract without any action by the retailer. Further, ATF views an exclusive
outlet arrangement as including a situation where the retailer offers exclusivity privileges and the industry member
accepts that offer. In other words, it does not matter whether the requirement originates with the industry member
or the retailer; rather, the requirement is within the exclusive outlet prohibition so long as it is part of the bargain.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 105(b) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to induce through any of the following means,
any retailer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages to purchase any such products from such person to the exclusion
in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce,
provided one of the three jurisdictional clauses is met:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) By acquiring any interest in real or personal property owned, occupied, or used by the retailer in the conduct of
the business; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) By furnishing, giving, renting, lending, or selling to the retailer, any equipment, fixtures, signs, supplies,
money, or other things of value, subject to the exceptions prescribed by regulations, having due regard to public
health, the quantity and value of articles involved, established trade customs not contrary to the public interest
and the purposes of the subsection; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) By paying or crediting the retailer for any advertising display or distribution service; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) By guaranteeing any loan or repayment of any financial obligation of the retailer; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) By extending to the retailer credit for a period in excess of the credit period usual and customary to the industry
for the particular class of transactions as ascertained by the Secretary and prescribed by regulation; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) By requiring the retailer to take and dispose of a certain quota of any of such products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Retailer independence can be threatened in a tied-house arrangement between an industry member and a retailer when
the arrangement involves a continuing business relationship which restricts the retailer's ability to make free
economic choices on which brands of products to purchase. In effect, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition is restricted because the retailer who is dependent on or tied to an industry member cannot make free and
rational business choices on whether to make a current purchase from another industry member based on current business
considerations such as consumer demand or lower prices offered by the competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations identify threats to a retailer's independence which include: A wholesaler's use of partial
ownership of a retailer to control the retailer's purchases of alcoholic beverages, sales where the wholesaler conditions
the purchase of one distilled spirits product on the retailer purchasing another distilled spirits product at the
same time, and wholesaler control over the retailer through controlling the resetting of the products on a retailer's
premises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Slotting fees are also included in this proposed category. These fees are paid to a retailer in order to obtain premium
shelf space. Data and information on the effect of such fees is requested, rather than solely statements of preference
by a particular industry member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the material relating to consignment sales, the prohibition on other than a bona fide sale is defined
to include sales in connection with which the industry member bears the cost of display by purchasing or renting a trade
buyer's shelf space to be occupied by such products. Accordingly, slotting fees in these situations are within the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consignment sale proscriptions. Comments are sought on whether the slotting fee should be addressed in both tied-house
and consignment sale regulations or are more appropriately covered by only one of the provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the practices listed in proposed &sect;6.152, ATF will be required to determine whether the practice
results in the retailer purchasing less than it otherwise would have of a competitor's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also identify certain practices that will not result in exclusion. These are the practices
allowed under the regulatory exceptions to the tied-house provisions (safe harbors). For instance, the proposed
regulations recognize that certain retail activities of a temporary nature, such as weekend events and community
festivals, are also so minor in the retail marketplace so as not to justify Federal intervention. (Revisions to these
regulatory exceptions are also proposed in this notice and discussed in detail below.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial Bribery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 105(c) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to induce through any of the following means,
any trade buyer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages, to purchase any such products from such person to the exclusion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce,
provided one of the three jurisdictional clauses is met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By commercial bribery; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) By offering or giving any bonus, premium, or compensation to any officer, or employee, or representative of the
trade buyer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial bribery situations involve the receipt of money or a premium by an officer, employee, or representative
of the trade buyer. Payment made directly to business entities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
the corporation, partnership, or individual owning the business) for the use of the business does not constitute
a commercial bribe. The independence of the trade buyer is threatened in a commercial bribery situation because the
officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer is making a purchasing decision as a result of the money or
premium received personally and not based on business or marketing factors which further the interests of the trade
buyer itself.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations identify promotional conduct by an industry member that involves the payment of money or
another premium to an employee or representative of a trade buyer without the knowledge of the trade buyer as practices
under the Act that place retailer independence at risk. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fedway
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court noted that previous case law upheld as actionable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these types of payments. These payments were viewed as anti-competitive because one competitor gained a competitive
advantage over another competitor by reason of a ``secret and corrupt dealing with employees or agents of prospective
purchasers.'' See,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
104 F.2d 582 (7th Cir. 1939). Even where such practices exist, ATF would still be required to demonstrate that they
affect the trade buyer's purchases in order to establish exclusion. With respect to those practices not mentioned
herein, ATF would be required to demonstrate the existence of both of the elements of exclusion set forth above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Criteria for Determining Retailer Independence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF is proposing criteria by which to evaluate whether or not a particular practice places retailer independence
at risk. Elements which have repeatedly been mentioned in court cases are degree of control exercised over trade buyers'
purchasing decisions, duration of the practice, indiscriminateness, contractual or other enforceable requirements.
The goal of regulating trade practices in the alcoholic beverage industry has been identified as healthy competition
in order to insure the best possible price, quality and selection for the consumer and to prevent formation of a corrupt
black market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria are indications that a particular practice, other than those in &sect;&sect;6.152, 8.52,
and 10.52, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in order to place retailer
independence at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer to decide which products to purchase and
the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase
of the industry member's products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry
member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner
in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without
business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, ATF designated an agency task force to review the trade practice regulations and ATF's enforcement experience,
since 1980, and determine whether revisions were needed. ATF determined that certain regulations may need to be modified
or clarified to provide guidance to the industry on ATF's interpretations of the trade practice statute. Such guidance
has been provided by rulings and industry circulars. This notice proposes incorporating these rulings and industry
circulars into the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to changes identified in the Bureau's own review, this notice responds to changes suggested in a February,
1992, petition filed by representatives of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. (DISCUS), the
National Association of Beverage Importers, Inc. (NABI), Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Inc. (WSWA),
the National Licensed Beverage Association (NLBA), and the National Liquor Stores Association, Inc. (NLSA). This
petition superseded an earlier petition filed by DISCUS and NABI with ATF. ATF requested that DISCUS and NABI work
with all segments of the alcohol beverage industry to reach a consensus concerning the various proposals to revise
the trade practice regulations. The 1992 petition reflects a culmination of that effort by the supplier, wholesaler,
and retailer organizations noted above.

ATF is proposing to revise or add regulations in 27 CFR Parts 6, 8, 10, and 11, in areas suggested by the industry petition

ATF is proposing to revise &sect;&sect;6.1, 8.1, 10.1 and 11.1 to reflect the recodification of the Federal Administration

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF proposes adding new regulations stating that ATF officers are authorized to examine relevant records of an industry
member and to subpoena relevant records from any person. These new regulations would be codified as &sect;&sect;6.5,
8.5, 10.5 and 11.5. Current regulations do not contain any reference to ATF's statutory authority to examine and subpoena
records and to require reports from industry members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 102(c) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C. 202(c)) incorporates by reference the provisions of sections 49 and 50 of title
15, U.S.C. of the Federal Trade Commission Act which vests in ATF investigative subpoena authority and the right to
examine and copy relevant data subject to an FAA Act investigation. In addition, section 102(d) provides authority
to require such reports as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 49 and 50 as made applicable by section 102(c), ATF may examine, at all reasonable times, any documentary
evidence which is necessary to determine whether the person, partnership, or corporation being investigated or
proceeded against violated the FAA Act. The right to examine includes the right to copy any such documentary evidence.
In addition, section 49 authorizes the issuance of a subpoena for any person, partnership, or corporation to produce
records or give testimony relevant to an investigation of a violation of the FAA Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, pursuant to section 102(d) of the FAA Act, new regulations are proposed for parts 6, 8, and 10, authorizing
the regional director (compliance) to require a letter report from industry members regarding information on sponsorships,
advertisements, promotions, and other activities conducted by, or on behalf of, or benefiting the industry member.
The reporting requirement will be used on a case-by-case basis, rather than as a recurrent and periodic reporting
requirement such as a monthly report of activities applying to all industry members. ATF does not feel that a reporting
requirement is needed for part 11, Consignment Sales.

Meaning of Terms Revisions in Parts 6, 8, 10 and 11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF is proposing to add the terms ``ATF officer'' and ``Director'' to the definitions in 27 CFR 6.11, 8.11, 10.11, and
11.11 to correspond to the terms in the proposed administrative provisions in &sect;&sect;6.5, 8.5, 10.5, and 11.5,
discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF is proposing to define the term ``brand'' in 27 CFR 6.11, since a number of dollar limitations on things of value
which may lawfully be given to retailers is on a ``per brand'' basis. The definition proposed is drawn from ATF Ruling
81&hyph;1, Q.B. 1981&hyph;2, page 27, but ATF has narrowed the proposed definition to exclude changes in the color
or design of the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF is proposing adding the term ``Regional director (compliance)'' to the definitions in 27 CFR 6.11, 8.11 and 10.11
to correspond to the term in the proposed administrative provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners believe that the definition of ``retailer'' should be revised in 27 CFR parts 6 and 8. The current provision
excludes wholesalers who make incidental retail sales representing less than 5 percent of their sales during the
preceding two months. The petitioners state that a supplier cannot know whether the wholesaler's retail sales are
within the 5 percent limitation and suggest eliminating that standard. The petitioners also believe that the definition
of ``retailer'' should be clarified in order to ensure that this definition is consistent with &sect;6.2 which defines
the territorial extent of part 6 of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that removal of the 5 percent limitation would make the definition too broad. For example, without the
percent limitations, a wholesaler who makes a single sale to a consumer is deemed to be a retailer. Also, the petitioners'
proposed definition would exclude, as a retailer, someone within the United States who makes sales for consumption
outside of the United States; i.e., a duty free shop. The FAA Act itself does not allow this type of exception to the territorial
coverage of the law. Therefore, ATF does not agree with this proposal. For the same reasons, ATF does not agree with
the proposed amendment to the definition of ``retailer establishment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF is proposing to change the term ``retailer establishment'' in 27 CFR 6.11 to ``retail establishment'', since
that is the term used in 27 CFR part 6 regulations. The term ``retail establishment'' in 27 CFR 8.11 will be removed because
the term is not used in 27 CFR part 8 regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners state that these sections of the regulations provide identical treatment concerning an interest
of an industry member in a license with respect to a retailer's premises (&sect;&sect;6.25&hyph;6.27) and in real
or personal property owned, occupied, or used by the retailer in the conduct of the business (&sect;&sect;6.31&hyph;6.33).
The petitioners feel that combining the provisions, which they believe parallel each other (&sect;&sect;6.25 and
6.31; 6.26 and 6.32; and 6.27 and 6.33), will enhance the simplicity and clarity of the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the petitioners recommend clarifying changes to existing regulations to ensure that there is no misunderstanding
that a violation of the FAA Act does not occur merely upon a finding of the existence of the means to induce. The petitioners
believe that the wording of several existing regulations describing various means to induce results in industry
confusion since such sections are written in terms describing ``prohibited means to induce.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners believe that the term ``prohibited'' should be deleted from such sections in order to avoid any contention
or confusion that this provision, read separately from &sect;6.21, allows for finding a violation of the FAA Act without
also establishing that the means to induce results in exclusion. While the petitioners recognize that these sections
are subject to the general application provisions of &sect;6.21, which states that these means to induce are unlawful
only if they result in exclusion, they believe such a change will help reduce the possibility of industry confusion
on this issue. The same request was made concerning &sect;&sect;6.31, 6.41, 6.51, 6.61, 6.65 and 6.71, which all contain
similar language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF does not object to revising the language in &sect;&sect;6.25, 6.31, 6.41, 6.51, 6.61, 6.65 and 6.71. ATF proposes
to adopt this suggestion but would replace the word ``inducement,'' with ``means to induce,'' in order to correspond
with the wording of the FAA Act. Conforming changes were also made to the language in &sect;&sect;6.27 and 6.33. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF does not believe that the provisions of &sect;&sect;6.25 through 6.33 should be combined in the various ways proposed
by the petitioners. From a structural point of view, merging &sect;&sect;6.25 through 6.33 fundamentally alters
the organization of subpart C of part 6. Subpart C is divided into topics (with titles) which parallel sections 105(b)(1)
through (7) of the FAA Act. The proposed merger of the corresponding sections will mean that the regulations applicable
to an interest in retail property under section 105(b)(2) will be contained in a group of the regulations categorized
under an interest in a retail license under section 105(b)(1). ATF believes that it may be confusing for a person or
industry representative relying on the part 6 regulations to look under the regulations on a retail license for a regulation
relating to an interest in retail property.

Section 6.42, Third Party Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF's review of its regulations disclosed that some confusion exists over the breadth of the proscription on indirect
means to induce. Some industry members incorrectly view the two examples in &sect;6.42 as exclusive of the situations
covered by the regulation. Additionally, ATF believes some industry members interpret the examples as meaning the
third party receiving the means to induce must be an agent of an individual retailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By enacting the phrase ``directly or indirectly or through an affiliate,'' Congress intended the broadest possible
application of the proscriptions of the FAA Act. The term ``indirectly'' encompasses more than simply trade practice
activities with agents of retailers. It covers such activities with any representative of a retailer or industry
member, whether or not such representative is technically an agent of the retailer or industry member. Thus, an industry
member providing the means to induce to any third party who will pass the means on to the retailer, or use them in a manner
to benefit the retailer, is indirectly providing the means to induce to the retailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, ATF proposes revising &sect;6.42 to clarify that the examples are simply illustrative and not exclusive
of the situations resulting in indirect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inducements. A revision to the final sentence is proposed for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners recommend deleting the last sentence of &sect;6.43. The petitioners believe that negotiation by
an industry member with an equipment company for a special price for a retailer for equipment should not be a means to
induce unless the industry member subsidizes the special price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF does not agree. The means to induce is not the special price, but the service provided by the industry member in negotiating
with the equipment company, or using its influence on behalf of the retailer. In the past, ATF has experienced cases
in which a retailer, believing that it received special price consideration, altered its buying patterns resulting
in exclusion of a competitor's products. Also, a conforming change to the cross-reference is proposed.

The petitioners recommend deleting this section because they believe that it is redundant and unnecessary in light
of &sect;6.93 and their proposed revisions to &sect;6.87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF proposes to remove this section since the general prohibition in &sect;6.41 covers things of value not specifically
excepted in subpart D. Those of the examples listed in &sect;6.47 which ATF proposes to allow will be listed in the proposed
revision of &sect;6.84, Point of sale advertising and consumer advertising specialties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF proposes that the phrase ``placed by the retailer'' be deleted from this section and that language be added to emphasize
that it does not matter whether the retailer or the industry member places the advertisement. The means to induce to
be addressed here is the cooperative nature of the transaction and the benefit received by the retailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For clarity, ATF proposes cross-referencing &sect;6.52 to &sect;6.98, Advertising Service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF's current position is contained in Revenue Ruling 54&hyph;162, 1954&hyph;1 C.B. 340. On August 1, 1979, ATF proposed
a regulation (Notice No. 327, 44 FR 45298) on credit arrears which would have provided that a supplier could continue
to sell to a retailer, with unpaid purchases existing in excess of 30 days, without violating the extension of credit
provision if the retailer either made payments in accordance with Revenue Ruling 54&hyph;162 or the amount of arrears
did not exceed an average purchase by the retailer from the supplier over the preceding 4 month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the proposal objected to the proposal stating that it would require extensive bookkeeping checks or
it might force repayment of large outstanding debts in order to keep dealing with a wholesaler. Several commenters
recommended that ATF simply adhere to the credit requirements imposed by State law. ATF withdrew the proposal (T.D.
ATF&hyph;74, 45 FR 63242, September 23, 1980) from further consideration. ATF is again raising the issue and proposing
to adopt in the regulations the position stated in Revenue Ruling 54&hyph;162. However, comments on other possible
approaches will be considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the language change to &sect;6.71 discussed under &sect;6.41, the petitioners propose to eliminate
the tie-in prohibition in &sect;6.72 and consolidate the remaining provisions into &sect;6.71. The petitioners
recommend deleting the first two sentences of &sect;6.72 because they believe that there is no statutory basis for
this regulation under the FAA Act. The petitioners state that the classic ``tying relationship'' prohibited by the
antitrust laws is not addressed by section 105 of the FAA Act notwithstanding that subsection 105(b) of the FAA Act
bears the heading ``Tied-House.'' The petitioners further state that prohibitions against tie-in agreements are
covered adequately by the Federal antitrust laws.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tie-in sale described in the regulations is a form of quota sale covered by the Act. Moreover, ATF feels that &sect;6.71
and &sect;6.72 are distinct from one another and should be kept separate to insure clarity and foster understanding
of the regulations. The fact that another Federal law may apply to such a practice is not relevant to whether such a practice
is covered by the FAA Act. Additionally, ATF proposes revising &sect;6.72 to cover expressly a particular type of
transaction as a tie-in sale.

Many changes discussed in the first section of the Supplementary Information on Exclusion affect this subpart. The

which were not discussed in that earlier section.

Section 6.81, General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners propose amending &sect;6.81(a) by deleting the second sentence which prohibits an industry member
from conditioning the providing of items or services allowed under subpart D on the purchase of distilled spirits,
wine, or malt beverages. ATF agrees this prohibition is not necessary for most items, and will remove the prohibition
from the general section and place it in the specific sections where such conditioning has been a concern, for instance,
&sect;6.83 on product displays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.81(b), Recordkeeping requirements, requires industry members to maintain certain records which can
be used to substantiate claims that items provided to retailers are within the subpart D exceptions to the tied-house
prohibitions. The petitioners propose deleting &sect;6.81(b) in its entirety, thereby eliminating all recordkeeping
requirements. The petitioners state that ``(t)his change should be adopted because the FAA Act neither provides
nor suggests that any such requirements can be imposed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners further state that if it is decided not to delete &sect;6.81(b) in its entirety, they recommend the
addition of language to this paragraph to make it clear that no separate violation of the FAA Act shall arise from the
failure of an industry member to maintain records in accordance with the requirements of &sect;6.81(b). The petitioners
believe that the FAA Act neither creates nor supports the existence of any such violation of the FAA Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to eliminate the requirement to keep records which substantiate industry members' claims that items
provided retailers are within the exceptions would negate ATF's capability to verify compliance with the dollar
limitations and any other requirements of subpart D. The limitations in each exception section of the regulations
would be unenforceable if ATF had no way to verify compliance with the requirements of such exceptions. Where the industry
member fails to keep the required records, the industry member is not eligible for the regulatory exception in that
particular transaction. No separate recordkeeping violation would be charged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the petitioners do not request a specific change to this section, they request that ATF explore alternate methods
which would be cost effective for ATF to convey this information in a manner that continues to ensure that all permittees
are apprised of the annual dollar adjustments. Instead, ATF proposes to delete this section and periodically review
the amounts if necessary.

Section 6.83, Product Displays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners recommended amending the definition of product display to substitute ``*&blank;*&blank;* and
similar items the primary function of which is to hold, display or shelve consumer products.'' for ``*&blank;*&blank;*
and the like,'' which appears in the current regulation. ATF is incorporating this change in its proposed revision,
but proposes the phrase ``hold and display'' for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also requested that ATF amend the dollar limitation in the regulation to reflect the current adjusted
rate. Instead, ATF proposes a $500 per brand at any one time per retail establishment limitation for the current limitation
of $100 (as adjusted) per year per brand per retail establishment. As noted earlier, ATF proposes narrowing the definition
of the term ``brand'' and requests comments on the definition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the general prohibition against an industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member imposing conditions on receipt of items allowed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart D has been removed from &sect;6.81, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;6.83 states that giving or selling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product displays may be conditioned upon the purchase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distilled spirits, wine or malt beverage product advertised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereon in a quantity only necessary for the initial completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or use of the product display. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan or rental of product displays would not be within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exception. Such a continuing tie would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the intent of the Act. Industry members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have long argued that they should be allowed to condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of product displays on the purchase of a limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of the product advertised. The dollar limit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$500 per brand, coupled with the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanently inscribed advertising and transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership of product displays to the retailer minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the inducement value to the retailer. The combination of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors allows product displays to be excepted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations of Part 6, and would be the basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing the industry member to condition receipt of such

Promotions and practices currently allowed under the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would combine several of the current exceptions into one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general regulatory section. The approach of having a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general section addressing all of the similar activities gives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater flexibility to the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations combine the exceptions listed in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

specialties) into a revised &sect;6.84, Point of sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising and consumer advertising specialties. Items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended for consumers currently identified in &sect;6.47 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also included in the proposed listing of exceptions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioners requested that ATF amend the dollar limitation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the adjusted rates, but instead, under ATF's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision there will be no limit to the specified point of sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(POS) materials furnished by an industry member to a retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also requested that the term ``wine lists'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be expanded to include all alcoholic beverages. Instead, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;6.84 permits all lists or menus, subject to the

furnishing things of value to a temporary retailer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners recommend that these four sections be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined in a new section 6.88, under the title ``Equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies,'' because they deal with similar types of merchandise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and impose similar conditions. As with other subpart D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions which combine similar types of merchandise, (viz., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;6.83, 6.87 and 6.89), the petitioners feel that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combining these items in one section will enhance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplicity and clarity of the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also recommend several other revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this consolidated section. They believe that the coverage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coil cleaning service should be extended from ``a retailer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wine or malt beverages'' to ``a retailer.'' This amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would provide equal treatment for wine, malt beverages and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled spirits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also recommend substituting the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``dispensing accessories'' in section 6.88 for ``tapping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessories'' because the former term more accurately describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modern type of accessories falling within this category and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects present marketplace practices where, for example, wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also is served by dispensing equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also feel that cold plates should be added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the list of examples of ``dispensing accessories'' and, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the present requirements for glassware and tapping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessories, carbon dioxide gas or ice may be sold at a price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not less than the cost to the industry member who initially

purchased it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

accessories, carbon dioxide gas or ice. Dispensing accessories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include items such as standards, faucets, cold plates, rods, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, taps, tap standards, hoses, washers, couplings, gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gauges, vent tongues, shanks and check valves. (b)

Application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An industry member may sell equipment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies to a retailer if the equipment or supplies are sold at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a price not less than the cost to the industry member who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially purchased it, and if the price is collected within 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of the date of the sale. (2) If dispensing accessories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sold pursuant to (1), the industry member also may install 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them at the retailer's establishment. (c) Coil cleaning

service may be furnished, given or sold to a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the petitioners' proposal to combine various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections into one all inclusive section covering equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies is structurally logical and the terminology change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from tapping equipment to dispensing equipment has merit, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the items listed in the proposed section have not in the

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF is consolidating these sections with the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional changes. ATF proposes to revise the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glassware to include similar containers made of materials other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than glass. Currently, &sect;6.89 enumerates the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tapping accessories which can be sold, at cost, to a retailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the regulation also specifies that the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member must pass on the cost of initial installation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would expand the original coil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning service exception currently in &sect;6.97 to cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled spirits, as well as wine and malt beverages. Keeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coils clean and free of contamination is clearly in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest of public health. Therefore, it is in the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest to allow such services without a dollar limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulation allows industry members to sell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon dioxide gas to retailers. The regulation does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the sale of other gases, such as nitrogen, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used in various existing alcoholic beverage dispensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. ATF proposes modifying this regulatory section to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow industry members to sell any gas to a retailer provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is used in a beverage dispensing system. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be viewed as sanctioning treatment which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change still wine to sparkling wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6.91, Samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current section allows an industry member to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or give samples of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a retailer. The petitioners recommend amending this section to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that industry members may furnish a maximum of 750 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milliliters (mls.) of distilled spirits samples to qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retailers. The 500 milliliter (ml.) container is no longer an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized size for distilled spirits. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioners suggest that ``750 ml.'' should be substituted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``500 milliliters'' in the second sentence of this section and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the third sentence of this section should be eliminated in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF agrees with the petitioners that the reference to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obsolete 500 ml size be replaced, but proposes a maximum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3 liters for either distilled spirits or wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF also proposes amending the current regulation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting the number of commonly owned retail establishments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(not to exceed four per retailer) which can be given samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment would allow for a control State or chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retailer to receive sufficient samples to determine whether to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase a product.

Section 6.93, Combination Packages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, &sect;6.93 addresses combination packages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where an industry member packages a non-alcoholic item with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages and, in particular, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c) requires that the cost of the combination package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be passed on to the retailer. The petitioners recommend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleting paragraph (c) of &sect;6.93 because they feel the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition imposed by the paragraph is really a pricing decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside of ATF's regulation under the FAA Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF proposes removing all the conditions currently imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on combination packages.

Section 6.94, Educational Seminars
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF proposes to clarify the final sentence, ``This does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize an industry member to pay a retailer's expenses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with an educational seminar.'' by adding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanatory phrase ``(such as travel, lodging, and meals).''

Section 6.98, Advertising Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners recommend adding the clause ``except where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusive retailer in the state is a state agency'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``&sect;6.98 Advertising service
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The advertisement does not also contain the retail price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product, except where the exclusive retailer in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state is a state agency, and *&blank;*&blank;*'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners do not believe that the objectives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 105(b) of the FAA Act are served by prohibiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry members from advertising control States' prices. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioners' proposed revision would permit an industry member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to advertise a control State's state-wide retail prices as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by that State for product sold within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners feel that in such circumstances, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of any ``inducement'' or ``exclusion'' that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contravene the intent or purpose of the FAA Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF proposes amending the current regulation in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the industry request, modified to reflect situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the sole retailer in a jurisdiction is a State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. ATF also proposes to delete the condition that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertisement placed by an industry member may not mention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events or promotions at a retail establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners recommend revising this section to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry members to also ``recommend shelf plans.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioners feel that this revision would permit an industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member to provide services to a retailer consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present day marketplace realities. ATF proposes to amend this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section in line with the petitioners' proposal.

Section 6.100, Participation in Retailer Association Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6.100 permits industry members to participate in retailer association activities under certain circumstances.
Paragraphs (b) and (d) permit rental of display booth space and purchase of tickets or payment of registration fees,
respectively. Each of these paragraphs contains the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``if *&blank;*&blank;* not excessive and *&blank;*&blank;* the same as paid by all exhibitors.'' ATF proposes amending
the section to delete ``not excessive'' and specifying the fees must be the same as the fees paid by all exhibitors ``at
that event.'' ATF also proposes raising the limitation for payments for advertisements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs or brochures authorized by paragraph (e) from $100 to $500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6.101, Merchandise
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) currently provides that an industry member who also is engaged in business as a bona fide vendor of other
merchandise may sell such merchandise to a retailer if three conditions are met, the first of which is that merchandise
is ``sold at its fair market value.'' The petitioners believe, however, that ATF has no authority to regulate or condition
legitimate marketing practices pertaining to bona fide sales of non-alcoholic beverage products. Accordingly,
the petitioners recommend changing this condition to state that the merchandise is ``furnished, distributed, or
sold according to the custom and practice of that business.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also recommend eliminating paragraph (b) regarding things of value covered in other sections of
part 6 since they believe it is redundant and unnecessary in light of other sections of subpart D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that the elimination of the phrase, ``*&blank;*&blank;* fair market value,'' from paragraph (a), as
proposed by the petitioners, would result in an ambiguous regulation. The phrase is used in other parts of the regulations.
The adoption of the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* custom and practice of that business,'' would be inconsistent and
potentially confusing. Additionally, ATF believes that the elimination of paragraph (b) of this regulation would
be a mistake. Paragraph (b) is a necessary clarifying paragraph for the section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, &sect;6.101 excepts from the prohibitions of section 105(b)(3) of the FAA Act sales transactions
by industry members who are engaged in the business as bona fide vendors of other merchandise in addition to alcoholic
beverages. This section sanctions sales of other merchandise to retailers in addition to alcoholic beverages if
the merchandise is sold at its fair market value, not in combination with distilled spirits, wines, or malt beverages,
and the merchandise is itemized separately on the industry member's invoices and other records. The records are necessary
so that ATF can determine the real cost of the merchandise to the industry member and whether the industry member is
reselling the merchandise to retailers at its fair market value. Likewise, ATF needs these records to determine whether
the industry member is a bona fide vendor of the merchandise or whether it is using the merchandise as a means to induce.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, ATF is proposing to revise the records requirement of the regulation to state that, first, acquisition
costs must appear on the industry member's purchase invoices (available upon request to ATF) and, second, the merchandise
and the distilled spirits, wines, or malt beverages sold to the retailer in a single sales transaction must be itemized
separately on the same invoice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation can be interpreted to mean that a violation of the section could occur if a third party requires
the retailer to use an industry member's product without the knowledge of the industry member. ATF proposes clarifying
that the industry member's requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with a third party is necessary to violate this
section. However, the requirement need not originate with the industry member. If the industry member knows or is
aware that the third party controlling the retailer extends such a requirement with respect to the products of the
industry member making payments under the arrangement, and the industry member avails itself of such requirement,
then the requirement within the proscription of the FAA Act is present.

ATF proposes amending this section to correct the wording of paragraph (a)(1), which appeared in error in ATF TD&hyph;74
on September 3, 1980 (45 FR 63242). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is considered for revision because ATF feels that its purpose should be clarified. The following example
of a sales representative incentive program is viewed as being within the commercial bribery provision: An industry
member and a trade buyer meet to discuss, among other things, upcoming programs to promote a particular product or
products. They agree that certain promotions will be run over a period of time. Some of these promotions include sales
incentive programs in which sales representatives can win money and/or prizes. At the conclusion of the meeting,
the parties agree or understand, or it is implied, that all or part of the funding for these sales representative incentive
programs will come from monies that have been or will be provided by the industry member, usually under the guise of
unrestricted funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF's position is that the above example is an instance of commercial bribery since it involves the furnishing of a
premium or bonus to an employee of a trade buyer. While no change to the language of the section is proposed at this time,
ATF solicits comments on whether the section is unclear or ambiguous.

Section 11.24, Other Than Bona Fide Sale
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 105(d) of the Act addresses ``consignment sales.'' Section 105(d) describes consignment sales to include
conditional sales (i.e., where an industry member is not paid for products until they are sold by a trade buyer); sales
with a privilege of return (i.e., where an industry member agrees to repurchase products that remain unsold by the
trade buyer at the end of a specified period of time); and other sales on any basis otherwise than a bona fide sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consignment sales are essentially arrangements pursuant to which the risk, or cost, of non-sale of a product is retained
by an industry member, or transferred from a trade buyer back to an industry member at the expiration of a specified
time period. ATF is proposing to add a new &sect;11.24 to its regulations to specify certain other arrangements, in
addition to conditional sales and sales with a privilege of return, in which the risk of non-sale is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred from the trade buyer back to the industry member and which therefore do not constitute bona fide sales.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the proposed rule specifies that so-called ``slotting allowances,'' arrangements pursuant to which
an industry member makes payments to a trade buyer, ostensibly for shelf space, are a form of consignment sale. The
practical effect of ``slotting allowances'' is to refund, in whole or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, the purchase price of a product that has not been sold, in proportion to the period of time that it remains unsold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a minimum, payment of ``slotting allowances'' may reimburse the trade buyer for the cost of shelf space occupied
by the industry member's products. In addition, it may also compensate the trade buyer for the lost opportunity cost
of having capital tied up in inventory acquired from the industry member. Ultimately, the amount refunded by this
mechanism can, over any specified period of time, be the economic equivalent of simply buying back a product at the
end of that period of time.

ATF believes that its regulations should address all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements that clearly embody the substance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``consignment sale'' practice proscribed by Congress, and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely particular forms of that practice. Therefore, ATF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to amend its regulations to specify payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``slotting allowances'' from an industry member to a trade buyer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a form of consignment sale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation specifically allows products which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unmarketable for certain reasons to be exchanged, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain conditions, for an equal quantity of identical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, but is silent as to whether such products may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned for cash or credit. Industry Circular 81&hyph;11 states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a return of such products for cash or credit is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precluded by section 11.32. ATF proposes changing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation to incorporate the provisions of Industry Circular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
81&hyph;11 into the section. The revised section would also delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references to mutilated and missing strip stamps since they are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF proposes revising the current regulation to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return of a product if, due to a change in law or regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over which the trade buyer has no control, a particular size or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brand is no longer permitted to be sold. The addition of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It has been determined that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a Regulatory Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not required.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently available, it is hereby certified under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 605(b)) that this proposed regulation, if adopted, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis is not required. It has been suggested, however, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the proposed interpretation of exclusion may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect of ``freezing'' industry member standings where they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are. For instance, a large wholesaler might be in a better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position to offer indiscriminately premiums for volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases, and retain a competitive advantage over a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesaler who could not afford to offer a similar inducement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all customers. On the trade buyer side, a small retailer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be more likely to lose its freedom in purchasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions because of a relatively minor service or piece of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment it receives from a particular supplier. Although ATF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the proposed regulations are required to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF's policy into conformance with Federal court decisions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA Act, ATF requests the comments of small businesses and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their representatives on this subject. We will review this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification in light of any pertinent comments we may receive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the public interest and ensure fair trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition in the alcoholic beverage industry. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information will be used to analyze promotional activities as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The authority to require reports which is stated in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking is to be used on a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis only, and does not apply to industry members in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated number of respondents in any given year is 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

considered. Comments received after the closing date and too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
late for consideration will be treated as possible suggestions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for future ATF action. ATF will not recognize any comment as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidential. Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material which the respondent considers to be confidential or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate for disclosure should not be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. The name of the person submitting the comment is

class, type, or kind designation; appellation of origin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(wine); vintage date (wine); age (distilled spirits); or

percentage of alcohol. Differences in packaging such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in label design or color, or a different style, type

 Criteria for determining retailer independence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice, other than those in &sect;6.152,
places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order
to place retailer independence at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer to decide which products to purchase and
the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase
of the industry member's products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry
member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner
in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without
business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry member requirements, by agreement or otherwise, with non-retailers that result in a retailer being required
to purchase the industry member's products are within the exclusive outlet provisions. These industry member requirements
are covered whether the agreement or other arrangement originates with the industry member or the third party. For
example, a supplier enters into a contractual agreement or other arrangement with a third party. This agreement or
arrangement contains an industry member requirement as described above. The third party, a ballclub, or municipal
or private corporation, not acting as a retailer, leases the concession rights and is able to control the purchasing
decisions of the retailer. The third party, as a result of the requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with the industry
member, requires the retailer to purchase the industry member's products to the exclusion, in whole or in part, of
products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce. The business arrangements entered
into by the industry member and the third party may consist of such things as sponsoring radio or television broadcasting,
paying for advertising, or providing other services or things of value.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, places retailer independence
at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and retailer or by any other means of industry member control
over the retailer, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it would have of a competitor's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 8.52 lists practices that result in exclusion. Section 8.53 lists practices not resulting in exclusion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The practices specified in this section result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act. The practices specified
here are examples and do not constitute a complete list of such practices:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Purchases of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages by a retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat
or act of physical or economic harm by the selling industry member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Contracts between an industry member and a retailer which require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits,
wine, or malt beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer from purchasing, in whole or
in part, such products from another industry member.

 Practices not resulting in exclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The practices specified in this section are deemed not to result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A supply contract for one year or less between the industry member and retailer under which the industry member
agrees to sell distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages to the retailer on an ``as needed'' basis provided that the
retailer is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of such product.

&sect;8.54
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
 Criteria for determining retailer independence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice, other than those in &sect;8.52
and 8.53, places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section
in order to place retailer independence at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer to decide which products to purchase and
the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase
of the industry member's products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry
member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner
in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without
business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

Exclusion, in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When a practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affiliate, places trade buyer independence at risk by means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a tie or link between the industry member and trade buyer or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other means of industry member control over the trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buyer, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Such practice results in the trade buyer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing less than it would have of a competitor's product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10.52 lists practices that create a tie or link that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places trade buyer independence at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 10.53 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserved and will list practices not resulting in exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10.54 lists the criteria used for determining whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other practices can put trade buyer independence at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;10.52

Practices which put trade buyer independence at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The practice specified in this section is deemed to place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade buyer independence at risk within the description of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion in &sect;10.51 of the regulations. The practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerated here is an example and does not constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete list of those situations which result in such control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Industry member payments of money to the employee(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a trade buyer without the knowledge or consent of the trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buyer-employer in return for the employee agreeing to order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;10.54 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Criteria for determining trade buyer independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria specified in this section are indications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a particular practice, other than those in section 10.52, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places trade buyer independence at risk. A practice need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place trade buyer independence at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choice of a trade buyer to decide which products to purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retailers and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The industry member obligates the trade buyer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The trade buyer has a continuing obligation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The trade buyer has a commitment not to terminate its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the industry member's products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the trade buyer. For example, the industry
member controls the trade buyer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the
manner in which the products will be displayed on the trade buyer's premises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all trade buyers in the local market on the same terms
without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to comply with Public Law the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1994, the Department of Defense is in the process
of promulgating a regulations with regard to members of the Armed Forces which includes provisions for the involuntary
allotment of the pay of a member of the Armed Forces for indebtedness owed a third party as determined by the final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction, and as further determined by competent military or executive authority, as
appropriate, to be in compliance with the procedural requirements of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act
of 1940; and which gives consideration for the absence of a member of the Armed Forces from an appearance in a judicial
proceeding resulting from the exigencies of military duty. While the Department of Defense has traditionally by
regulation required members to pay their just financial obligations, no mechanism previously existed to enforce
payments of just debts with the exception of payments owned for child or spousal support. The proposed revision of
Department of Defense Directive 1344.9 (32 CFR part 50) establishes a program for involuntary allotments to require
members to pay their just debts. The impact to the government of this legislation is much greater than to the public.
The Department of Defense must hire additional personnel to process and review applications, as well as incur administrative
processing costs (e.g., mailing, record keeping, xeroxing, and providing of processing forms). Additionally,
the program will require personnel time in the form of review and providing assistance (e.g., military legal assistance)
to members against whom an application for involuntary allotment is pending. The cost to the applicant for an involuntary
allotment against a member's pay will be minimal in terms of time and money. The applicant will have to provide information
which should already be in the applicant's possession, incur postage costs, and expend approximately 15 minutes
completing the application form. In return for their effort, applicants with enforceable claims will be entitled
to receive from the military member an involuntary allotment of pay on a monthly basis towards satisfaction of the
judgment debt owed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to 32 CFR part 50 requires the use of two forms. The first form is an involuntary allotment application. Use
of a standard form is required because the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1994 require a determination by competent
military or executive authority that the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction giving rise to the involuntary
allotment application complies with the requirements of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act. Additionally,
in order to ensure due process for involuntary allotment applications, several certifications and acknowledgements
are required by the applicant. In the absence of a standardized form, the cost to the government of reviewing non-standard
forms for compliance would be unfairly burdensome in comparison to the minimum cost to an applicant of obtaining and
using a standard form to make application. Furthermore, use of a standard form saves the applicant time and money by
not requiring the applicant to obtain a copy of the Department of Defense Directive and reading it in order to ensure
proper submission of information to obtain an involuntary allotment. The second form for involuntary allotment
notice and processing creates a standardized methodology within the Department of Defense, to include the Military
Departments, to ensure uniform processing procedures. This saves both time and money for the review authorities.
Both forms are in the process of development. However, their basic contents and requirements are clearly delineated
in appendix A to 32 CFR part 50. It has been determined that 32 CFR part 50 is not a significant regulation action. The
rule does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the
economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with
an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants,
user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
It has also been determined that this rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it
will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary financial
effect on administering the rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the
simplification and clarification of certain policies. Finally, it has been determined that 32 CFR part 50 may impose
reporting or record keeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520) and
that the paperwork reduction process is under review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
debt complaints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Creditors are encouraged to use the processing procedures for debt complaints described in appendix A to this
part. Complaints meeting the requirements of this part will receive prompt processing assistance from commanders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assistance in indebtedness matters will not be extended to those creditors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Who have not made a bona fide effort to collect the debt directly from the military member;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whose claims are patently false and misleading;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Whose claims are obviously exorbitant; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Who are in an ``off-limits'' status, or who have been determined to be practicing unfair consumer or commercial

(3) Some States have enacted laws which prohibit creditors from contacting a debtor's employer with respect to indebtedness
or communicating facts on indebtedness to an employer unless certain conditions are met. The conditions which must
be met to remove this prohibition are generally such things as reduction of a debt to judgment and obtaining written
permission of the debtor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) At DoD installations in States having such laws, the processing of debt complaints will not be extended to those
creditors who are in violation of the State law. Commanders may advise creditors that this rule has been established
because it is the general policy of the Military Services to comply with State law when that law does not infringe upon
significant military interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) This policy will govern even though a creditor is not licensed to do business in the State where the debtor is located.
A similar practice will be commenced in any State enacting a similar law with respect to debt collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Under the provisions of Public Law 95&hyph;109, contact by a debt collector with third parties, such as commanding
officers, for the purpose of aiding debt collection is prohibited without a court order, or the debtor's prior consent,
given directly to the debt collector. Creditors are generally exempt from Public Law 95&hyph;109, but only when they
collect on their own behalf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The following general policies apply to processing of involuntary allotments (except statutory allotments
for child support or alimony).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) In those cases in which the indebtedness of a military member has been reduced to a judgment, an application for
an involuntary allotment from the disposable pay of the member may be made pursuant to the procedures described in
appendix A to this part. These procedures provide the exclusive remedy available under Public Law 103&hyph;94.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Involuntary allotment requests will not be processed for creditors who, either at the time of application for
the involuntary allotment or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, are in an
``off-limits'' status, or who have been determined to be practicing unfair consumer or commercial practices detrimental
to the morale and welfare of service members, pursuant to applicable directives of the military services, to include
the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An involuntary allotment from a member's disposable pay shall not be commenced in any indebtedness case in which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment
was rendered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements of the SSCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Only one involuntary allotment pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part may be authorized from the disposable
pay of a member at any given time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An involuntary allotment shall not exceed the lesser of 15 percent of a member's disposable pay, or the maximum
amount authorized under the garnishment law of the State where the judgment was entered. An involuntary allotment
shall not be authorized if the pay of a similarly situated civilian employee is not subject to garnishment under the
applicable State law and Public Law 103&hyph;94.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The amount of an involuntary allotment under Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part when combined with deductions
as a result of garnishments or statutory allotments for spousal support and child support under 42 U.S.C. 659, 661,
662, or 665, may not exceed the maximum percentage specified in 15 U.S.C. 1673. In any case in which the maximum percentage
would be exceeded, garnishments and involuntary allotments for spousal and child support shall take precedence
over involuntary allotments authorized under Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part. Involuntary allotments established
pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 shall be reduced or stopped as necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum percentage
allowed.

Full disclosure and standards of fairness by creditors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Truth in Lending Act prescribes the general disclosure requirements which must be met by those offering or extending
consumer credit, and 12 CFR part 226 prescribes the specific disclosure requirements for both open-end and installment
credit transactions. In place of Federal Government requirements, State regulations apply to credit transactions
when the Federal Reserve Board has determined that the State regulations impose substantially similar requirements
and provide adequate enforcement measures. Commanding officers, with the assistance of judge advocates, should
check regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether Federal or State laws and regulations govern.

in Lending Act, and 12 CFR part 226 have been met and that the Standards of Fairness (appendix C to this part) have been
applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Creditors subject to 12 CFR part 226, and assignees claiming thereunder, shall submit with their request for debt
processing assistance an executed copy of the Certificate of Compliance (appendix B to this part), and a true copy
of the general and specific disclosures provided the military member as required by the Truth in Lending Act. Requests
which do not meet these requirements will be returned without action to the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A creditor not subject to 12 CFR part 226, such as a public utility company (as set forth in &sect;226.3 thereof),
shall submit with the request a certification that no interest, finance charge, or other fee is in excess of that permitted
by the law of the State in which the obligation was incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A foreign-owned company having debt complaints shall submit with its request a true copy of the terms of the debt
(English translation) and shall certify that it has subscribed to the Standards of Fairness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Indebtedness complaints which meet the requirements of this part will be processed by DoD Components. Processed

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
means that Heads of DoD Components, or designees, shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Review all available facts surrounding the transaction forming the basis of the compliant, including the member's
legal rights and obligations, and any defenses or counterclaims the member may have.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Advise the member that (1) just financial obligations are expected to be paid in a proper and timely manner, and what
the member should do to comply with that policy; (2) financial and legal counseling services are available under the
provisions of DoD Directive 1344.7
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in resolving indebtedness; and (3) that a failure to pay just debts may result in the creditor obtaining a court judgment
which could form the basis for collection of pay from the member pursuant to an involuntary allotment.

and counseling may be available from the on-base military banking office, or the credit union serving the military
field of membership, or other available military community service organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Direct that the appropriate commander advise the claimant that (1) those aspects of DoD policy prescribed in &sect;50.5
are pertinent to the particular claim in question; and (2) the member concerned has been counseled concerning his
or her obligations with respect to the claim. The commander's response will not undertake to arbitrate any disputed
debt, or to admit or deny the validity of the claim. Under no circumstances will the response indicate whether any action
has been taken against the member as a result of the compliant.

(1) Each application must include a copy of the final judgment certified by the clerk of court, proof of actual service
on the member, and such other documents as may be required by paragraph B.1.b. of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

order to apply for an involuntary allotment under this appendix.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Proof of actual service on the military member shall, in the case of any default judgment, and may, in other cases,
be demonstrated by including with the application for involuntary allotment a copy of the return of service showing
personal service on the member or, where service by certified or registered mail is permitted by the rules of court,
of the return receipt for such mail signed by the member. Involuntary allotments will not be authorized without evidence
of actual service. In cases where jurisdiction was obtained by substituted service (such as service by publication
or by mailing to a last known address), or where the judgment was entered on a confession of judgment, no involuntary
allotment will be authorized and the application will be returned to the creditor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Applications for involuntary allotment, must contain the following information, certifications, and acknowledgment:

must be attached to the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A certification that the judgment has not been amended, superseded, set aside, or satisfied; or, if the judgment

judgment or other court documents comply with the rights of the member under the SSCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A certification that the member's pay could be garnished under applicable State law and Public Law 103&hyph;94

allotment if the judgment is satisfied prior to the collection of the total amount of the judgment through the involuntary
allotment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) A certification that if the member overpays the amount owed on the judgment, the applicant will refund the amount
of overpayment to the member within 30 days of discovery or notice of the overpayment, whichever is earlier, and that
if the applicant fails to repay the member, the applicant understands he or she may be denied the right to collect by
involuntary allotment on other debts reduced to judgments.

practices detrimental to the morale and welfare of service members, pursuant to applicable directives of the military
services, to include the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations regulation.

United States to any person pursuant to any application made in accordance herewith.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and three copies of the application and supporting documents), is required for processing of any request to establish
an involuntary allotment pursuant to this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The designated DFAS official shall refuse to process any application that does not conform with the requirements
of this part, is unsigned, is incomplete in any material regard, lacks required documentation, or contains false
certifications. If an application is ineligible for processing under this part, the application package shall be
returned to the applicant with an explanation of the deficiency. In cases involving repeated false certifications
by an applicant, the designated DFAS official may refuse to accept or process additional applications by that applicant
for such period of time as the official deems appropriate to deter against such violations in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Promptly upon receipt of DD Form aa, ``Involuntary Allotment Application'', the designated DFAS official shall
review the ``application package'' to ensure compliance with the requirements of this part. If the application package
is complete, the DFAS official shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Determine the location and address of the commander as designated by the military service to have authority to
give notice of the involuntary allotment application to the member against whose pay the involuntary allotment application
in sought, and, if required, to determine whether exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from
the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Mail one copy of the application package to the member and two copies of the application package, along with DD Form
bb,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 ``Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing,'' to the commander of the military member;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Within 60 days of mailing of the copies of the application package and DD Form bb, ``Involuntary Allotment Notice
and Processing'', DFAS will provide notice to the member and the member's commander that automatic processing of
the involuntary allotment application will occur if a response is not received within 90 calendar days from the original
date of mailing. Additionally, notice will be provided that automatic processing may be delayed if the member's commander
provides DFAS notice that the member has been granted an extension to respond as authorized by this part, the date the
response is due, and the reason(s) for the extension. In the absence of any additional correspondence from the member's
commander, DFAS may automatically process the involuntary allotment application 15 calendar days after the extended
date that the commander notified DFAS the response was due.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Retain the original of the application package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Upon receipt of an application package and DD Form bb, ``Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing,'' from the
designated DFAS official, the commander (as noted in paragraph B.2.a.(1) of this Appendix) will immediately notify
the member of the receipt of the application, provide the member a copy of the entire application package, and counsel
the member using and completing Part I of DD Form bb concerning the following.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That an application for the establishment of an involuntary allotment has been received and that the member could
have up to 15 percent of disposable pay taken to satisfy the judgment upon which the application is based.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the member has 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the notice to respond to the commander by completing
Part II of DD Form bb and submitting any information or documentation deemed relevant by the member. That for good cause
shown, the commander may grant an extension of reasonable time (normally not exceeding 30 calendar days) to submit
a response. That during times of deployment, war, national emergency, or other similar situations, extensions exceeding
30 calendar days may be granted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) That the member's response will either consent to the involuntary allotment or contest it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That the member may contest the application for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The member's rights under the SSCRA were not complied with during the judicial proceeding upon which the involuntary
allotment application is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from appearance in a judicial proceeding forming
the basis for the judgment upon which the application is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Information contained in the application is false or erroneous in material part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The judgment has been fully satisfied, or has been superseded or set aside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The judgment has been materially amended, or partially satisfied. When asserting this defense, the member shall
include evidence of the amount of the judgment that remains in effect and is unsatisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) There is a legal impediment to the establishment of the involuntary allotment (for example, the judgment debt
has been discharged in bankruptcy, or the judgment debtor has filed for protection from the creditors under the bankruptcy
laws of the United States, or the applicant is not the judgment creditor nor a proper successor in interest to that creditor).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Either now or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, the applicant (and the
judgment creditor, if different from the applicant) was (were) in an ``off-limits'' status, or had been determined

(h) Either now or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, the applicant (and the
judgment creditor, if different from the applicant) was (were) acting in a manner that violated the Standards of Fairness
promulgated as Appendix C to this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Or other appropriate reasons which must be clearly specified and explained by the member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) That, if the member contests the involuntary allotment, the member shall provide evidence (documentary or otherwise)
in support thereof. The evidence provided must enable the decisional authority to decide whether to approve the application
for an involuntary allotment. Furthermore, that any evidence submitted by the member may be disclosed to the applicant
for the involuntary allotment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) That the member may consult with a legal assistance attorney, or a civilian attorney at no expense to the government.
That if a legal assistance attorney is available, the member should immediately arrange for an appointment. That
if a legal assistance attorney is not available, the member may request form the commander an appropriate delay until
such time as a legal assistance attorney becomes available for consultation (in cases where a response will not be
submitted back to DFAS within 90 days from the date DFAS mailed the copies of the application package, the commander
must immediately notify the designated DFAS official of the delay, the date for an expected response, and the reason
for the delay_e.g., unavailability of a legal assistance attorney for counseling). Additionally, that requests
for extensions of time based on the need for legal assistance may be denied to members who fail to exercise due diligence
in seeking such assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) That if the member contests the involuntary allotment on the grounds that exigencies of military duty caused the
absence of the member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered, then the member's commander
will review and make the final determination on this contention, and notify the designated DFAS official of the commander's
decision by completing Part III of DD Form bb and forwarding the form to DFAS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) That if the member contests the involuntary allotment on any basis other than exigencies of military duty, the
application package, DD Form bb, and the member's response, if any, will be returned to the designated DFAS official
for appropriate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) That if the member fails to respond to the commander within the time period specified (including any extensions
authorized by the commander), the commander shall notify the designated DFAS official of the member's failure to
respond by completing Part III of DD Form bb and forwarding the form to DFAS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. After counseling the member (as noted in paragraph B.2.a.(1) of this appendix) the commander shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Date and sign Part I of DD Form bb;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obtain the member's acknowledgment of counseling by having the member sign in the appropriate space on Part I of
DD Form bb;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determine if the member consents to the involuntary allotment or needs the time authorized under this part to review
the application package and take appropriate action. If the member consents to the voluntary allotment, the commander
will direct the member to appropriately complete Part II of DD Form bb. The commander will then forward the DD Form bb
to the designated DFAS official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) As soon as possible, but not later than the end of the authorized time period for the member to submit his or her response,
the commander will forward by mail the DD Form bb and any response received from member to DFAS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the member fails to respond within the time authorized for a response, or asserts that exigencies of military
duty caused the absence of the member from an appearance in the judicial proceeding upon which the Involuntary Allotment
Application is sought, then the commander will complete Part III of DD Form bb prior to forwarding of the form and the
member's response, if any, to the designated DFAS official.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In determining whether exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member, the commander at the level
designated by the Service concerned shall consider the definition of ``exigencies of military duty'' contained
in this part, the evidence provided by the member, any other reasonably available evidence (e.g., a copy of the member's
personnel record), and whether the military duties in question were of such paramount importance that they precluded
making the member available to attend the judicial proceedings, or rendered the member unable to timely respond to
process, motions, pleadings, or orders of the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The evidentiary standard for a commander to determine whether exigencies of military duty caused the absence
of the member from an appearance in the judicial proceeding upon which the Involuntary Allotment Application is sought
is ``a preponderance of the evidence''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Provide the member a copy of the completed DD Form bb within five days of mailing to the designated DFAS official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Upon receipt of DD Form bb, ``Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing,'' and any additional evidence submitted
by the member, the designated DFAS official will conduct a review of the entire application package, DD Form bb, ``Involuntary
Allotment Notice and Processing,'' and any evidence submitted by the member, to determine whether the application
for an involuntary allotment will be approved and established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In those cases where the commander of the member has completed Part III of DD Form bb, and determined that exigencies
of military duty caused the absence of the member from an appearance in a judicial proceeding upon which the involuntary
allotment application is sought, the designated DFAS official shall deny the involuntary allotment application.
The designated DFAS official will provide the applicant written notice of the denial and the reason therefor. Additionally,
the designated DFAS official shall advise the applicant that the responsibility for determining whether exigencies
of military duty existed belonged to the member's commander, that the commander's decision is final, that DFAS has
no authority to change the commander's decision regarding exigencies of military duty, and that any correspondence
concerning this issue should be addressed to the Service concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In all cases other than as described in paragraph B.2.d(1) of this section, the designated DFAS official shall
deny an involuntary allotment application, and give written notice to the applicant of the reason(s) for denial,
if the designated DFAS official determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The member's rights under the SSCRA were not complied with during the judicial proceeding upon which the involuntary
allotment application is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The pay of a similarly situated civilian employee is not subject to garnishment under applicable State law and
Public Law 103&hyph;94, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Information contained in the application is false or erroneous in material part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The judgment has been fully satisfied, or has been superseded or set aside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The judgment has been materially amended, or partially satisfied. In such a case, the request for involuntary
allotment may be approved only to satisfy that portion of the judgment that remains in effect and unsatisfied; the
remainder of the request shall be denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) There is a legal impediment to the establishment of the involuntary allotment (for example, the judgment debt
has been discharged in bankruptcy, or the judgment debtor has filed for protection from the creditors under the bankruptcy
laws of the United States, or the applicant is not the judgment creditor nor a proper successor in interest to that creditor).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Either now or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, the applicant (and the
judgment creditor, if different from the applicant) was (were) in an ``off-limits'' status, or had been determined
to be practicing unfair consumer or commercial practices detrimental to the morale and welfare of services members,
pursuant to applicable directives of the military services, to include the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board
and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Either now or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, the applicant (and the
judgment creditor, if different from the applicant) was (were) acting in a manner that violated the Standards of Fairness
promulgated as Appendix A to this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A separate involuntary allotment (pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part) already exists against the
member's disposable pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Because of spousal and child support garnishments or statutory allotments, the member has insufficient funds
from which to pay the requested involuntary allotment without violating the applicable maximum percentage prescribed
in 15 U.S.C. 1673.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) The applicant has abused the processing privilege (e.g., an applicant, having been notified of the requirements
of this part, repeatedly refuses or fails to comply therewith).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Or other appropriate reasons which must be clearly explained to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In all cases other than as described in paragraphs B.2.d.(1) and (2) of this section, the designated DFAS official
shall approve the involuntary allotment application and establish an involuntary allotment against the disposable
pay of the member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The designated DFAS official shall, at any time after establishing an involuntary allotment, cancel or suspend
such allotment and notify the applicant of that cancellation if a member submits legally sufficient proof, by affidavit
or otherwise, that the allotment should not continue because of the existence of the factors enumerated in paragraph
B.2.d(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Except as provided in paragraph B.3.c. of this section, payment of an involuntary allotment shall commence within
30 days after the designated DFAS official has approved the involuntary allotment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Payments under this part shall not be required to be made more frequently than once each month, and the designated
official shall not be required to vary normal pay and disbursement cycles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If the designated DFAS official receives several applications concerning the same member of a Military Service,
payments shall be satisfied on a first-come, first-served basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Payments shall continue until the sum certain amount of the judgment is collected. Interest or other costs earned
during the collection period can be collected only by submitting a separate judgment and involuntary allotment application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. If the member is found not to be entitled to money due from or payable by the Military Services, the designated official
shall return the application and advise the applicant that no money is due from or payable by the Military Service to
the member. When it appears that disposable pay available for the purpose of involuntary allotment is exhausted temporarily
or otherwise unavailable, the applicant shall be told why and for how long that money is unavailable, if known. If the
member separates from active duty, the applicant shall be informed that the allotment is discontinued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The applicant shall notify the designated official promptly if the judgment upon which the allotment is based is
satisfied, vacated, modified, or set aside, and the designated official shall adjust or discontinue the involuntary
allotment accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The Comptroller may, in DoD 7000.14&hyph;R, Volume 7, Part A, designate the priority to be given to such involuntary
allotments among the deductions and collections taken from members' pay, except that they may not give precedence
over deductions required to arrive at a member's disposable pay or garnishments for alimony and child support payments
and statutorily required child and spousal support allotments. In the absence of a contrary designation by the Comptroller,
all other lawful deductions (except voluntary allotments by the member) and collections shall take precedence over
these involuntary allotments.

Appendix C to Part 50_Standards of Fairness
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. No finance charge contracted for, made, or received under any contract shall be in excess of the charge which could
be made for such contract under the law of the place in which the contract is signed in the United States by the military
member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. In the event a contract is signed with a U.S. company in a foreign country, the lowest interest rate of the State or
States in which the company is chartered or does business shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. However, interest rates and service charges applicable to overseas military banking facilities will be as established
by the Department of Defense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. No contract or loan agreement shall provide for an attorney's fee in the event of default unless suit is filed, in
which event the fee provided in the contract shall not exceed 20 percent of the obligation found due. No attorney fees
shall be authorized if the attorney is a salaried employee of the holder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In loan transactions, defenses which the debtor may have against the original lender or its agent shall be good against
any subsequent holder of the obligation. In credit transactions, defenses against the seller or its agent shall be
good against any subsequent holder of the obligation, provided that the holder had actual knowledge of the defense
or under conditions where reasonable inquiry would have apprised the holder of this fact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The military member shall have the right to remove any security for the obligation beyond State or national boundaries
if the military member of the family moves beyond such boundaries under military orders and notifies the creditor,
in advance of the removal, of the new address where the security will be located. Removal of the security shall not accelerate
payment of the obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. No late charge shall be made in excess of 5 percent of the late payment, or $5,00, whichever is the lesser amount, or
as provided by law or applicable regulatory agency determination. Only one late charge may be made for any tardy installment.
Late charges will not be levied where an allotment has been timely filed, but payment of the allotment has been delayed.
Late charges by overseas banking facilities are a matter of contract with the Department of Defense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The obligation may be paid in full at any time or through accelerated payments of any amount. There shall be no penalty
for repayment. In the event of prepayment, that portion of the finance charges which has inured to the benefit of the
seller or creditor shall be prorated on the basis of the charges which would have been ratably payable had finance charges
been calculated and payable as equal periodic payments over the terms of the contract, and only the prorated amount
to the date of prepayment shall be due. As an alternative, the ``Rule of 78'' may be applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If a charge is made for loan insurance protection, it must be evidenced by delivery of a policy or certificate of insurance
to the military member within 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. If the loan or contract agreement provides for payments in installation, each payment other than the down payment,
shall be in equal or substantially equal amount, and installments shall be successive and of equal or substantially
equal duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the security for the debt is repossessed and sold in order to satisfy or reduce the debt, the repossession and resale
will be governed by the laws of the State in which the security is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. A contract for personal goods and services may be terminated at any time before delivery of the goods or services
without charge to the purchaser. However, if goods made to the special order of the purchaser result in preproduction
costs, or require preparation for delivery, such additional costs will be listed in the order form or contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. No termination charge will be made in excess of this amount. Contracts for delivery at future intervals may be terminated
as to the undelivered portion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The purchaser shall be chargeable only for that proportion of the total cost which the goods or services delivered
bear to the total goods called for by the contract. This is in addition to the right to rescind certain credit transactions,
involving a security interest in real estate provided by Public Law 90&hyph;321 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation
Z (12 CFR part 226).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 10, 1994, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) submitted a recommendation to EPA under section
184 of the Clean Air Act (the Act), for additional control measures to be applied throughout the Northeast Ozone Transport
Region (OTR). Specifically, the OTC recommended that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport
Commission Low Emission Vehicle (OTC LEV or LEV) program for the entire OTR. The OTC's recommendation, developed
after notice-and-comment pursuant to section 184(c)(1), is published here as an appendix to this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 184(c)(3), EPA is to review the OTC's recommendation to determine whether the additional control measures
are necessary to bring any area in the OTR into attainment by the dates specified in the Act, and are otherwise consistent
with the Act. Based on this review, EPA is obligated to determine whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve
and partially disapprove the OTC's recommendation. If EPA disapproves or partially disapproves the OTC recommendation,
it is to explain why the recommended measures are not necessary or are not otherwise consistent with the Act, and to
specify additional control measures that would be equally effective. Upon EPA approval or partial approval of the
OTC recommendation, EPA is to make a finding that the relevant States' State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are inadequate
under section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act (relating to contribution to nonattainment in downwind States), and those
States are to submit a SIP revision within one year of the finding adopting the approved control measures. This notice
describes the framework for EPA's action on the OTC's recommendation and describes the issues EPA is considering
in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the recommendation.

The OTC's recommendation under section 184(c) of the Act that EPA mandate that States in the OTR adopt the LEV program
arises in the context of the program designed to address ozone (or ``smog'') pollution in subpart II of part D of title
I of the Act. This program is described in detail in EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), and the Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble,
57 FR 55620 (Nov. 25, 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of provisions in subpart 2 and elsewhere in the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are particularly important to emphasize here. Part D establishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a scheme for more polluted areas to have more time to attain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those more polluted areas to a graduated program of additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and more stringent specific control requirements to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished over the longer time-frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 181(a) provides for classification of ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment areas based on the degree of the nonattainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem in the area (as measured by the area's ozone design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value), and provides that attainment ``shall be as expeditiously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as practicable but not later than'' specified deadlines expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as years after enactment. The areas, and the corresponding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment deadlines are: Marginal (1993); Moderate (1996); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Serious (1999); Severe (2005 or 2007, depending on the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value); and Extreme (2010). The Act also provides for additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``unclassifiable/no data'' nonattainment areas. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classifications other than Extreme are represented in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(b) also specifies additional requirements applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for attainment areas in ozone transport regions, including: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs in cities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting specified size thresholds; (2) state-wide implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reasonably available control measures (RACT); (3) ``Stage II'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle refueling vapor controls or ``comparable measures''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) treatment of major stationary sources of ozone precursors as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they were in moderate nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 establishes the graduated control measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable for each nonattainment classification. These measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are additive in that the higher classifications must generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt, in addition to measures specifically applicable to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher classification, all measures identified for lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classifications as well. A basic requirement applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marginal and above classifications is that States are to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inventories of actual emissions from all sources in each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment area. See sections 182(a)(1) and 172(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These emissions inventories may be important in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the LEV program is necessary in the OTR. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the inventories may be important to determining the magnitude of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions reductions that may be needed for attainment, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of various measures to obtain such reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potentially key requirement is that Moderate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above areas must submit attainment demonstrations. Under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
182(b)(1)(A), for Moderate and above areas States are to specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their plans specific annual reductions in emissions ``as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to attain the [NAAQS] for ozone by the attainment date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable under this Act.'' Under section 182(c)(2)(A), for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Serious and above areas States are to submit a demonstration that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State Implementation Plan (SIP), ``as revised, will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for attainment of the ozone [NAAQS] by the applicable attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date.'' Further, this provision continues, ``[t]his attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other analytical method determined by the Administrator, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's discretion, to be at least as effective.'' These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements provide the motivation for the OTC's recommendation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as additional measures may be necessary for the States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that their SIPs will achieve timely attainment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling information is, of course, important to determining what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions are necessary in what areas for attainment in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also relevant that States are obligated to adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various measures specified for progress toward attainment, and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve certain percentage reductions in emissions by interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates. In general, section 172(c)(2) requires that SIPs ``require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable further progress'' (RFP), defined in section 171(1) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mean ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring attainment of the [NAAQS] by the applicable date.'' More 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically, section 182(b) provides that for Moderate and above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas States were to submit, by November 15, 1993, SIP revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for a 15% reduction in emissions of volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds (VOCs) from a 1990 baseline to be achieved by 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, section 182(c)(2)(B) provides that for Serious and above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas States are to submit, by November 15, 1994, SIP revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will result, subject to a limited feasibility exception, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional reductions in VOC emissions from the 1990 baseline of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3% each year averaged over consecutive 3-year periods beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1996 and until the attainment date. Section 182(c)(2)(C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for substitution of reductions in emissions of nitrogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for VOC, in accordance with EPA guidance. These RFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements establish minimum reductions that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment areas in the OTR will be required to achieve apart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from whether EPA approves or disapproves the recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 110 of the Act establishes general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for SIPs. Section 110(a)(2) specifies minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of a State's SIP, and subparagraph (D) specifies that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's SIP shall contain adequate provisions prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title, any source or other type of emissions activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the State from emitting any air pollutant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with maintenance by, any other State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to any such national primary or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary ambient air quality standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision, as discussed in detail below, is the key 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism under the transport provisions of sections 176A and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184, and is central to the OTC recommendation and to EPA's action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on it.

B. Ozone Transport Region Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTR was established by operation of law under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184 of the Act and is comprised of the States of Connecticut, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District of Columbia, and the portion of Virginia that is within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area that includes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District of Columbia. Congress established the OTR in the 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments to the Act based on the recognition that the transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ozone and ozone precursors throughout the region may render 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Northeast States' attainment strategies interdependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 184, the Administrator established a Northeast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozone Transport Commission for the OTR consisting of the Governor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each State or their designees, the Administrator or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designee, the Regional Administrators for the EPA regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices affected (or the Administrator's designees), and an air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution control official representing each State in the region, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appointed by the Governor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184(c) specifies a procedure for the OTC to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for additional control measures to be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within all or a part of the OTR if the OTC determines that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures are necessary to bring any area in the OTR into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment for ozone by the applicable dates in the Act. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184(c)(1) provides that Upon petition of any States within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport region for ozone, and based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority vote of the Governors on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission (or their designees), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission may, after notice and opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for public comment, develop recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for additional control measures to be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within all or a part of such transport region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the commission determines such measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are necessary to bring any area in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region into attainment by the dates provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by [subpart II of part D of title I of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c) also lays out procedures the Administrator is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to follow in responding to recommendations from the OTC. Upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the recommendations, the Administrator is to publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice stating that the recommendations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available and providing an opportunity for a public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 90 days. On March 18, 1994, EPA published a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announcing receipt of the OTC recommendation, 59 FR 12914. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further announced on April 8, 1994 that a public hearing would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held in Hartford, Connecticut on May 2&hyph;3, 1994, 59 FR 16811 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(April 8, 1994). The Administrator is also to ``commence a review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the recommendations to determine whether the control measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the recommendations are necessary to bring any area in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart II] and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are otherwise consistent with [the] Act.'' Finally, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaking her review, the Administrator is to consult with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of the OTC and is to take into account the data, views, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and comments received pursuant to the public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, sections 184(c) (4) and (5) govern EPA's response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTC recommendations. The Administrator is to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partially disapprove the recommendations within nine months of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt. For any disapproval, the Administrator is to specify: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Why any disapproved additional control measures are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the dates provided by [subpart II] or are otherwise not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Recommendations concerning equal or more effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions that could be taken by the commission to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform the disapproved portion of the recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the requirements of [section 184]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c)(5) provides that, upon approval or partial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of any recommendations, the Administrator is to issue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each State in the OTR to which an approved requirement applies a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding under section 110(k)(5) that the SIP for that State is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quoted above. Under section 184(c)(5), the Administrator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding of inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) is to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that each affected State revise its SIP to include the approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional control measures within one year after the finding is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 184(d) provides that, for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 184, the Administrator is to ``promulgate criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of determining the contribution of sources in one area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to concentrations of ozone'' in another nonattainment area. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria are to ``require that the best available air quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and modeling techniques be used for purposes of making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such determinations.''

C. Background Regarding OTC LEV Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator convened the OTC on May 7, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thereafter, the OTC moved to work toward a regional ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategy with emphasis on consensus agreements to adopt regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures to address the ozone problem in the Northeast. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the contribution of motor vehicles to the Northeast ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem, the OTC focussed early on emissions standards for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicles and on adoption of federal reformulated gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the OTR as potential additional control measures. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, however, imposes certain limitations on the States' ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 209 of the Act generally preempts States from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation to EPA under section 202 of the Act. Section 209 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does, however, provide an exception for California to adopt new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicle emissions standards where the Administrator grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a preemption waiver based on a finding that California's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards will be, ``in the aggregate, at least as protective of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under section 177 of the Act, any State which has SIP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions approved under part D of title I may adopt and enforce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new motor vehicle emission standards for any model year if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Such standards are identical to the California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for which a waiver has been granted for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) California and such State adopt such standards at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two years before commencement of such model year (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by regulations of the Administrator). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has granted a waiver for California's ``Low Emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle'' program (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993)(announcing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission Vehicle Standards (Jan. 8, 1993)). This program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally calls for five categories of vehicles meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progressively more stringent emissions standards: California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier I vehicles; Transitional Low Emission Vehicles (TLEV); Low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission Vehicles (LEV); Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). California has also established an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall non-methane organic gas (NMOG) standard that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer must meet for its fleet of new vehicles in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular model year by selling any combination of vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified by California as meeting standards for one of the five

At its second meeting on July 16, 1991, the OTC adopted a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which the State and District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Columbia representatives agreed that, in view of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant contribution of motor vehicles to the Northeast ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem, they all support California's Motor Vehicle Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program, and call on their jurisdictions to cooperatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the feasibility, air quality benefits, and associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of this Program in the OTR. At its third meeting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 29, 1991, the OTC States agreed to a further MOU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing that each OTC state would take steps to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California's Low Emission Vehicle program as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York and Massachusetts are the only States that have fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted the California LEV program in legislation and regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without contingencies, and both States are set to implement their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The automobile manufacturers' have challenged the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legality of both programs and both lawsuits are ongoing. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional program adoption, and the remaining States are at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1993, Maine, Maryland, and Massachusetts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioned the OTC to adopt a recommendation calling for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the California LEV program throughout the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the fall of 1993, the OTC held a number of public forums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in various locations in the Northeast, and held a public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Hartford, Connecticut on December 16&hyph;17, 1993. Finally, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its winter meeting on February 1, 1994 in Washington, D.C., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC voted by a 9 to 4 majority to recommend that EPA mandate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California LEV program throughout the OTR. (The OTC refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program they recommend as ``OTC LEV.'') New Hampshire, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey voted against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation. The OTC's recommendation contains the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The OTC LEV program would be applicable to all 1999 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent model year passenger cars and light duty trucks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the OTR; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subject to certain very limited exceptions, all vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold, imported, delivered, purchased, leased, rented, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquired, received, or registered in the OTR that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the OTC LEV program must be certified pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OTC LEV program would allow the sale of the five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of California vehicles: California Tier I, TLEV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LEV, ULEV, and ZEV; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Manufacturers could choose any combination of California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified vehicles to meet average NMOG fleet emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in the OTR as follows:

Regarding California's ZEV sales mandate, the OTC recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, to the extent it must apply to satisfy section 177, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall apply. But if it is not required under section 177, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTC recommends that the ``individual States within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic incentives designed to increase the sales of ZEVs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the programs they adopt.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The effective date for the OTC LEV program would be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTC provisions originated in Congress in the House bill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as introduced. That bill, as introduced, established an ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport region for the Northeast, and incorporated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures specified for general transport regions under what was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finally enacted as section 176A of the Act. That provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the House bill did not involve a plan for specific additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control measures. See H.R. 3030 at 92&hyph;93 and 49 (July 27, 1989), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History of the Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1990, 103rd Cong., 1st. sess. (Nov. 1993) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(hereinafter ``1990 Legislative History'') at 3828&hyph;29 and 3785. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The House committee then marked-up H.R. 3030 to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions as finally enacted. See H.R. Rep't No. 101&hyph;490, part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. at 527&hyph;28 (May 17, 1989), reprinted in 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 Legislative History at 3551&hyph;52. It described the bill as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing ``a public procedure and structure'' for an OTC to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmit recommendations to EPA and explained that EPA's response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``should be buttressed by supporting material.'' It further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated, ``The Committee expects that the Administrator's review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional control measures recommended by an ozone transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commission will fully acknowledge and respond to the dimensions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the transport problems addressed by the commission's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations.'' The report also set out the timetable for EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response within nine months, and for EPA to issue a finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP inadequacy ``[u]pon full or partial approval'' followed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States' SIP revisions within one year. H.R. Rep't. No. 101&hyph;490

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Senate bill, in contrast, as introduced provided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commission could, without any independent EPA review or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval, ``after notice and opportunity for comment, require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional control measures to be applied within such transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region if the commission determines such measures are necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to bring all areas in such region into attainment by the dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by this subpart.'' See S. 1630, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Sept. 4, 1989), reprinted in 5 1990 Legislative History at 9111. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Senate bill, as introduced, was amended in committee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for EPA review of an OTC ``plan'' for additional control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures. Under the Senate committee mark-up, the OTC could, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after notice and comment, develop a plan for additional control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures for the OTR, and would then transmit the plan to EPA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. The committee then included the general framework for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA review that survives in section 184 as enacted, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's obligation to explain any disapproval and recommend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives. The bill differed from the statute as enacted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, in that: (1) EPA was obligated to state in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice upon receipt of the plan that ``written data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
views, or comments on the plan may be submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator within ninety days beginning on the receipt date'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but was not obligated to conduct a public hearing; (2) EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to determine whether to approve the plan was 120 days, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than nine months; and (3) the bill provided that the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be deemed approved if the Administrator failed to act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 120 days. The Senate committee mark-up also included the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism for implementation whereby EPA would issue a finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the States' plans were inadequate, and that the finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require the States to revise their SIPs to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved additional control measures within one year after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding is issued. See S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;228, 101st Cong., 1st

In the Senate debate on the Senate bill, Senator Lieberman explained these developments. He explained that President
Bush's bill
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 would have left the final decision about imposing additional controls to EPA. But Senator Lieberman explained that
this was ``unacceptable'' because EPA's lack of support for past regional efforts to adopt controls was in part responsible
for their failure. Senator Lieberman went on to explain that concerns were raised to the committee that the commission
was being given ``too much authority'' because it would have ``ultimate authority to impose additional controls
on sources of emissions in the separate States.'' Lieberman emphasized the importance of taking from EPA the responsibility
for recommending baseline regional controls. He went on to explain that, under the bill.

Final authority to disapprove additional measures actually rests with EPA. However, EPA bears the burden, as clearly
stated in the bill, of demonstrating that the additional control measure is not necessary to bring any area of the region
into attainment by the dates provided. In making their decision, EPA must not place unfair burdens on the recipient
State.

The Administrator has the final authority to disapprove additional measures recommended by the Commission. However,
EPA bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary to bring any area
of the region into attainment by the dates provided and to recommend equal or more effective actions that could be taken
by the Commission to conform the disapproved portion of the recommendations. Any recommendations by EPA under this
section designed to replace the recommendations of the Commission shall not place an unfair burden on any state which
is the victim of the transported air pollution. Equal or more effective actions recommended by the EPA shall mean actions
which achieve equivalent progress towards attainment of the standard, given full consideration of the impact of
transported air pollution.

II. Applicability of Rulemaking Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184(c) establishes a specific notice-and-comment procedure both for OTC development of and EPA action to
approve or disapprove recommendations for additional control measures in the OTR. These procedures are compatible
with, but not necessarily identical to, the procedures the Agency must follow to issue a rule. The statute is silent
as to whether EPA can take final action on the OTC recommendation without complying with notice-and-comment rulemaking
procedures. EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are necessary if EPA disapproves the OTC recommendation
because such an action would not have a binding future effect on any regulated parties. It is less clear whether rulemaking
procedures are necessary for approval or partial approval of the OTC recommendation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regardless of whether rulemaking procedures are required, EPA recognizes the importance of public participation
in its decision-making process. The procedures required by section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act are an excellent vehicle
for ensuring an open, public process. Among other things, they require the establishment and maintenance of a rulemaking
docket that contains the information, data and documents upon which EPA bases its proposed and final rules; they provide
an opportunity for the public to present written and oral comments to the Agency, including an opportunity to rebut
views presented at a public hearing; and they require the Agency to respond to the significant public comments, criticisms
and new data submitted during the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that the better course in this instance is to follow section 307(d) rulemaking procedures and ensure
that there is an open public process that allows interested parties to put on the record their views, comments, arguments
and data relevant to the decision before the Agency.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Administrator has determined that, pursuant to section 307(d)(1)(V), if the Agency approves or partially approves
the OTC recommendation, section 307(d) will apply.

The decision to follow rulemaking procedures is intended to preserve EPA's option of approving or partially approving
the OTC recommendation. The Agency is not legally obligating itself to follow rulemaking procedures to the extent

the procedures set forth in 307(d) regardless of whether it approves or disapproves the OTC recommendation.

EPA has established Air Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;11 and placed in it the data, information and documents upon which
the Agency relied in drafting this proposal, as required by section 307(d) (2), (3) and (4). Section 307(d)(3)'s requirement
that EPA publish a notice of proposed rulemaking is met by this notice. In view of the limited nine month timetable for
EPA decision, to satisfy rulemaking requirements, EPA is also relying on the OTC's recommendation itself (developed
through the OTC's statutory notice-and-comment process), the OTC's technical analysis and response to comments,
as well as EPA's discussion of relevant issues, data, and other Agency information.

or disapprove the OTC recommendation, and invites comments on all of these issues. EPA intends to make every effort
to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the Agency's process to respond to the recommendation. In addition
to the opportunity to file written comments and present oral views at the May 2&hyph;3 public hearing, EPA intends
to hold a series of public meetings in the Northeast to provide further opportunity for oral presentation of views.
EPA also expects to supplement the record as necessary to allow the public to comment on new information and considerations
that EPA believes it should take into account in making a decision.

III. Standards Applicable to EPA Review of OTC Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184 of the Act specifies two general criteria that EPA is to apply in evaluating whether to approve, disapprove,
or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC recommendation. These are, first, whether the additional
control measures that the OTC recommends are ``necessary'' and, second, whether the additional control measures
are ``otherwise consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with th[e] Act.'' If the recommended measure is necessary and consistent with the Act, EPA believes it would be obligated
to approve the recommendation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that it has substantial discretion to interpret the ``necessary'' test, and is considering a number
of approaches, discussed below. EPA's evaluation of ``necessity'' could involve two fundamental analytic steps:
First, EPA believes it should consider the magnitude of emissions reductions in ozone precursors needed for the nonattainment
areas in the OTR to attain. Second, it may be appropriate to consider other potential emissions reduction measures
that may be available to satisfy the needed magnitude of emissions reductions, and compare the LEV program to alternative
measures. In connection with the magnitude of reductions needed for attainment, EPA is considering: (1) how it should
address the geographic dimension of determining where the LEV program is necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve
attainment; (2) how it should account for the timing of when the LEV program would generate reductions that could contribute
to attainment; and (3) whether EPA can take into account the need for the LEV program for maintenance purposes. In connection
with alternatives to the LEV program, EPA is evaluating relevant aspects of (1) the recommended LEV program; (2) the
FLEV alternative that the auto manufacturers have proposed; and (3) other possible emissions reduction measures
identified by EPA, the OTC, or other State bodies.

1. Necessity Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that more than one approach to defining what is ``necessary'' is conceivable. One possible approach
is to consider as necessary any additional control measures that contribute to attainment, as long as measures specifically
required by the Act or that are otherwise in place are insufficient to achieve attainment. Under this approach, the
relevant question would be whether additional reductions are needed for attainment, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of alternative control measures would not be relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second approach is to first consider what emissions reductions are needed for attainment and then to compare the
LEV program to alternative measures that could be adopted to achieve those reductions. Before enactment of the 1990
Amendments, EPA interpreted the term ``necessary'' generally in this manner under section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act,
in the context of preemption of State fuel requirements.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The section 211(c) provision specifically addresses how alternative measures should be compared for purposes of
evaluating necessity.

Other provisions of the Act also involve a ``necessary'' standard. Under section 110, the Administrator is to approve
a State's SIP revision if it meets the applicable requirements of the Act, including the requirement in section 110(a)(2)(A)
that the SIPs include measures ``as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of this Act.''
Prior to the 1990 Amendments, section 110(a)(2) provided that the Administrator shall approve a State's SIP if it
includes measures ``as may be necessary to insure attainment and maintenance'' of the primary and secondary NAAQS.
The Supreme Court has interpreted the ``as may be necessary'' language to mean that ``the Administrator must assure
that the minimal, or `necessary,' requirements are met, not that he detect and reject any state plan more demanding
than federal law requires.''

Also, in connection with its study and rulemaking under section 202(i) related to ``Tier 2'' motor vehicle emissions
standards, EPA is to determine whether ``there is a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
need
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 for further reductions in emissions.'' (Emphasis supplied.) As discussed below, EPA has not yet completed the Tier
2 study or the subsequent rulemaking, and thus has not yet interpreted this standard in that context.

Section 211(c)(4)(A) provides that, subject to specified exceptions, States may not regulate characteristics
of motor vehicle fuels or additives in order to control motor vehicle emissions once EPA has regulated that characteristic
or has found that such regulation is not necessary. Congress apparently sought to preempt States from interfering
with national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniformity in federal fuel regulations. Subparagraph (C) specifies an exception for States to regulate fuels and
additives in their SIPs, which the Administrator may approve ``only if [s]he finds that the State control or prohibition
is necessary to achieve the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard which the plan implements.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the 1990 Amendments, the term ``necessary'' was not further defined. At that time, EPA regulated the volatility
of gasoline under section 211(c) in order to control evaporative emissions of VOCs. Certain States sought approval
from EPA for more stringent volatility controls on the grounds that such more stringent controls were ``necessary''
under section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA approved States' more stringent volatility controls in New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York and New Jersey, among others
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
. In addition, EPA earlier approved Arizona's controls on oxygenate content of gasoline in order to control carbon
monoxide emissions as necessary under section 211(c)(4)(C).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In approving these State controls, EPA articulated a test for determining ``necessity.'' There, EPA explained that
if, after accounting for the possible reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from all other reasonable control measures, the State could demonstrate that further measures are still needed for
attainment, then the fuel controls are ``necessary'' within the meaning of section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA first articulated
this test in the Arizona case:

EPA believes that a fuel control measure may be ``necessary'' for timely attainment if no other measures that would
bring about timely attainment exist, or if such other measures exist and are technically possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement but are unreasonable or impracticable.'' 53 FR at 17413. In short, EPA's approach was that the controls
were necessary if they would still be needed for attainment after adoption of all other reasonable and practicable
measures. Congress subsequently codified this interpretation when it added a definition of ``necessary'' to section
211(c)(4)(C) in the 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments.

Of course, Congress did not codify this or any other definition of ``necessary'' in section 184. This difference might
arguably support EPA's discretion to adopt a different approach to the term under section 184.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In applying this definition of ``necessary'' in the fuel context, EPA explained that it would not require that a State
impose more drastic measures (such as driving prohibitions, gas rationing, or plant shutdowns), as alternatives
to State fuel controls. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 54 FR at 26031 and 26035. EPA further explained that it would conclude that measures are ``necessary'' when no other
measures that EPA or the State has found reasonable are available
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 to achieve this reduction. Beyond such identified ``reasonable'' measures, EPA need look at other measures before
[the fuel] control only if it has clear evidence that [the fuel] control would have greater adverse impacts than those
alternatives. Therefore, EPA can defer to [the State's] apparent view that [the fuel] control is the next less costly
(or is itself a reasonable) measure.

EPA did consider cost-effectiveness of alternative measures as one criterion, but not the only criterion, for evaluating
the reasonableness of the alternatives. 54 FR at 26035. EPA also explained: ``Arguably, an alternative measure is
`reasonable' only if its effects are less drastic than the effects of the fuel controls.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There may be some ambiguity whether EPA's test was whether (considering cost and other factors), the fuel controls
were more reasonable than alternatives, or that alternatives were so drastic as to prevent EPA from concluding that
they were reasonable. EPA did state that it determined that reasonable alternatives would not achieve enough reductions,
and that it ``determined that remaining controls such as gas rationing, driving reductions, and source shutdowns
are so drastic that the State may resort to fuel controls first.'' 54 FR at 26033. But EPA immediately thereafter characterized
its judgement as being that ``State fuel regulation is a less drastic course than gas rationing and other unpopular
controls.'' Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the least, it seems that EPA believed that comparing the reasonableness of fuel controls to alternatives was a significant
factor in determining whether the alternatives were themselves reasonable. EPA also explained that its judgment
about what is too drastic ``is a complicated policy determination'' requiring the Administrator to weigh factors
such as cost and popularity, and that such policy judgments need not be supported by the same technical record as, for
example, determinations of as the magnitude or reductions an area needs for attainment. 54 FR at 26033. Also, EPA did
not insist that the State fuel controls be sufficient to fill the shortfall to achieve attainment, or that all measures
needed to achieve attainment actually be adopted in order to qualify for the section 211(c)(4)(C) exception. Most
importantly, as the paragraph quoted above indicates, EPA gave significant deference to the State's determination
regarding whether the fuel control was the most reasonable and practicable measure to achieve the NAAQS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress's codification of EPA's interpretation of ``necessary'' in the fuel context confirms the validity of this
interpretation in the fuels context. EPA is considering whether this approach should apply here, including deference
to the OTC's view that no more ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' alternatives to the recommended measure are available
that would be sufficient for purposes of attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the fuels precedent, EPA believes that the statutory structure, together with the legislative history,
may further support giving substantial weight, or deference, to the OTC's recommendation that implementation of
the LEV program throughout the OTR is necessary for attainment in the region. While EPA is to review the OTC's recommendations
under section 184(c)(2)(B) ``to determine whether the control measures are necessary,'' under section 184(c)(4)
EPA is to specify ``why any disapproved additional control measures are not necessary'' if EPA disapproves or partially
disapproves the recommendations. Section 184 nowhere mentions a parallel obligation to explain why the additional
control measures are necessary in the case of approval or partial approval. EPA believes it could reasonably interpret
these provisions to mean that EPA is to start with a presumption of approving the OTC's recommendations, unless it
finds that the recommended measures are not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the legislative history could be read to support this view. As described above, the Baucus-Chafee Statement
of Managers, in discussing EPA's role in reviewing an OTC recommendation, pointed out EPA's ``heavy burden'' to ``demonstrat[e]
that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis supplied). As noted above, the Statement of Managers' discussion used identical language to Senator Lieberman's
description in the Senate debate. Further, Senator Lieberman characterized the Senate bill as ``clearly stating''
that EPA must demonstrate that the additional control measure is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be sure, EPA generally has an obligation to explain the basis for its decision, and the House Report did indicate
that EPA's response ``should be buttressed by supporting material.'' H.R. Rep't. No. 101&hyph;490 at 256, reprinted
in 2 1990 Legislative History at 3280, supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. But EPA's explicit statutory obligation to explain why a measure is ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 necessary'' together with the Senate's unequivocal interpretations in the legislative history may reasonably
indicate that EPA should give substantial weight to the OTC's determination of necessity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is mindful that its factual analysis of the LEV program's necessity will be subject to substantial uncertainty
within the nine month timetable provided for a decision. EPA expects this to be so both for the modeling information
regarding its analysis of the magnitude or reductions needed as well as the reasonableness of the LEV program and alterative
measures. Here, EPA is under a statutory obligation to reach a decision by November 10, 1994. Meeting this deadline
may be particularly important in this case, because the OTC States are obligated under section 182(b)(1)(A) and section
182(c)(2) of the Act to submit for their ozone nonattainment areas, by November 15, 1994, demonstrations that their
SIPs, as revised, will provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the dates applicable to each area. These States
presumably intend to rely on EPA's decision regarding the recommended LEV program in their attainment demonstrations
to show that their SIPs will provide for timely attainment. Without knowing whether EPA will approve, disapprove,
or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's LEV recommendation, the States would not know what magnitude
of emissions reductions their other SIP measures must achieve.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Under these circumstances, and in light of the legislative history and statutory structure, it appears appropriate
for EPA to at least resolve uncertainties in favor of approval, in deference to the OTC's determination of necessity.
In other words, it appears appropriate for EPA to start with the position that it should approve the OTC's recommendation
unless it has a sufficient factual basis to find that the LEV program is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 necessary. EPA requests comment on whether and the extent to which it should accord deference to the OTC's determination
that the LEV program is necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA notes that it generally has found SIPs inadequate and called for plan revisions after complete SIPs have been submitted
or where a new situation arises creating the inadequacy. Here, an approval of the OTC recommendation within the nine
month timetable would result in a finding under section 110(k)(5) of SIP inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) prior
to submission of attainment demonstrations due November 15, 1994. EPA believes this is appropriate. The Act does
not specify a deadline for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D); section 184 does not limit EPA to finding SIPs inadequate
only after attainment demonstrations are submitted; and section 110(k)(5) specifically authorizes EPA to require
SIP revisions ``to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described in section [184] and or section
[176A].'' Indeed, States may need to rely on EPA's decision here in their attainment demonstrations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also recognizes counter-arguments that it should apply a more stringent variant of the section 211(c)(4)(C)
approach, without deference to the OTC's view that no more ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' alternatives to the
recommended measure exist. This departure from the section 211(c) approach may be justified by a difference in context
between sections 211(c) and 184. In particular, the purpose of preemption under section 211(c) is to preserve national
uniformity in EPA fuel regulations, which States can override where ``necessary'' for purposes of achieving attainment.
In contrast, under section 184 the OTC is authorized to specify, subject to EPA approval, measures necessary for compliance
with the prohibition in section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act against significant contribution interfering with attainment
in any other State. States are already obligated to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) and are free to choose the control
measures to do so; section 184 adds an element of compulsion whereby the OTC may override an objecting State to impose
specific ``necessary'' measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arguably, EPA deference might be less appropriate for the OTC, which can specify measures overriding the objection
of a minority of its member States, and depriving them of their choice of measures to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D).
On the other hand, it can be argued that Congress, in enacting section 184, intended the OTC to be given a substantial
voice for proposing solutions to the ozone transport problem, even where its solutions override the views of some
member States. Moreover, strict insistence on showing that no reasonable and practicable alternatives are available
would seem to add little to the States' independent obligation to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), since States
are likely to choose reasonable and practicable means to comply. Still, Congress's own emphasis in the 1990 Amendments
on specifying control measures it thought necessary for attainment, in addition to specifying deadlines, may indicate
that allowing the OTC to specify additional control measures, even under a strict interpretation of ``necessary,''
is significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether, if that test should apply, EPA the interpretation of ``necessary'' under section
211(c)(4)(C) should apply here. In addition, EPA requests comment on whether it should defer to the OTC's evaluation
of whether ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' alternatives to the LEV program are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA is considering how comparative cost-effectiveness and other social and environmental factors should
affect its analysis of reasonable and practicable alternatives. One possible approach is that the LEV program would
be necessary if it is still needed after all more cost-effective measures are adopted. As noted above, EPA considered
cost-effectiveness as a criterion, but not the only criterion, in evaluating the reasonableness of controls under
section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA recognizes that other policy reasons may support adoption of control measures that may
not appear to be the most cost- effective for purposes of attaining the ozone NAAQS. For example, the socio-economic
distribution of the burden of particular measures, employment impacts, and cross-media environmental impacts
may affect the choice of control measures. EPA requests comment on how these factors should affect an analysis of alternatives.

2. Magnitude of Reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, EPA believes it should address the amount of reductions needed for attainment in the OTR as the first
step in evaluating whether the LEV program is necessary. In particular, EPA believes it is important to evaluate what
reductions are needed, where they are needed, and when they are needed. In addition, EPA is considering whether it
may also consider whether the LEV program is necessary for maintaining the ozone NAAQS even after it is achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC addressed the magnitude of reductions necessary for OTR attainment in its response to comments and technical
support documents. There, the OTC expressed the belief that the control strategies specifically mandated in the
Clean Air Act would not be sufficient for the nonattainment areas in the OTR to achieve and maintain the ozone NAAQS.
The OTC believes that more reductions will be needed than the LEV program would generate. Also, the OTC notes that,
despite an overall recent decline in the frequency and severity of ozone exceedances, it believes that short term
trends have proven inaccurate indicators of long term status. Further, the OTC notes that studies indicate that the
trend toward fewer exceedances will reverse without significant additional NO

Regarding the scientific basis, the OTC also contends that emissions inventories, photochemical modeling and ambient
monitoring data constitute the best tools available to evaluate the need for emissions reductions, despite continuing
refinement of this scientific information. The OTC recognized that most air quality analysis in the past has focused
on domains within a particular State rather than on a broader region. It asserts that it assessed the need for and effectiveness
of reductions in the OTR using photochemical models, monitoring data, trajectory analyses, and mobile emission
models.

a. Focus on Contribution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the outset, EPA believes the concern in section 184 with ozone transport affects its analysis of where emissions
reductions are necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve attainment. That is, EPA currently believes that the ``need''
for additional measures in the OTR under section 184 should not focus on a State's need to adopt the LEV program in its
own jurisdiction for the benefit of in-State nonattainment areas. States, of course, retain full authority to adopt
this program under section 177 without EPA approval. Rather, EPA believes that the focus should be on the need for upwind
States that contribute to nonattainment downwind to adopt the LEV program not for their own benefit but for the benefit
of the downwind areas that could not otherwise attain on time. The statutory structure, including the reliance in
section 184(c)(5) on section 110(a)(2)(D), as well as the legislative history, support this conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course, EPA recognizes that upwind States also have an independent obligation to adopt measures for purposes of
their own timely attainment. The measures upwind areas adopt for their own benefit may well be sufficient to prevent
contribution to nonattainment downwind. While upwind areas may still contribute pollutants downwind after they
have reached attainment, their independent obligation to attain should go a long way to reducing emissions that contribute
to downwind nonattainment.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 It nevertheless seems that reductions in upwind areas may be necessary to prevent significant contribution to nonattainment
downwind, even if the upwind areas would have to achieve those reductions for their own benefit, anyway. In other words,
it does not seem that upwind areas' own need to reduce emissions for their own attainment should render those reductions
unnecessary. To be sure, upwind areas' independent implementation of the LEV program in their SIPs may make it unnecessary
for administrative purposes to mandate those controls. But EPA's obligation to mandate the recommended LEV measure
does not appear to turn on whether the States already have or would have to implement that program for their own benefit.
Rather, EPA's obligation seems to turn on whether the program is necessary for purposes of downwind attainment, regardless
of whether it is necessary or has been adopted for upwind attainment purposes. EPA requests comment on this view.

One complication, discussed further below, is the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
timing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 of reductions upwind, where the upwind areas may have a later attainment deadline.

Finally, EPA notes that it may be possible for downwind areas that are the recipients of transported pollution to counteract
some portion of the incoming pollutants by adopting more controls downwind than would otherwise be necessary. Such
areas might diminish the reductions necessary upwind by adopting such more stringent controls downwind. For downwind
areas that are less polluted and have less stringent controls in place, the downwind areas might even be able to ``over-control''
at less cost than it would take for upwind areas to prevent some increment of contribution. On the other hand, it may
not be fair to insist that downwind areas bear the cost of counteracting pollution that is generated upwind. In any
case, however, no area receives air at its boundaries that is free of ozone or precursors. Thus, in evaluating what
upwind contribution ``needs'' to be reduced for attainment downwind, it may be important to determine what ``boundary
conditions'' downwind areas should be entitled to receive. EPA requests comment on these issues, and particularly
on the extent to which it should view upwind reductions as necessary for attainment downwind, if the downwind area
could, through extra controls, make those upwind reductions unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Timing of Reductions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the OTC recommendation calls for adoption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the LEV program in the OTR in 1996, providing two years lead-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to auto manufacturers with the LEV standards applicable to model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1999 vehicles. The benefits of this program are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent upon turnover in the vehicle fleet. As referenced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, EPA is thus mindful that this schedule for the LEV program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not generate reductions in time to assist areas in meeting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate area 1996 and will generate only minimal reductions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the serious area 1999 attainment deadline. More benefits would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available for severe areas with a 2005 or 2007 attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadline. The importance of when upwind reductions are necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for downwind attainment, and when the LEV program will generate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such reductions raises a number of important issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in order for the LEV standards to apply in model year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1999, EPA may have to reach a decision to approve the OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation by the end of 1994. This may be an important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor supporting EPA's action within the nine month statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timetable based on the best available current information. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 177 of the Act, States may adopt motor vehicle emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards identical to California's standards if ``California and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State adopt such standards at least two years before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator).'' Under EPA's current regulations, model year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1999 may begin as early as January 2, 1998 (See 40 CFR 86.082&hyph;2). To provide two years lead-time, States might
then have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt California's standards by January 2, 1996 in order for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to apply for model year 1999.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 If EPA were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the OTC's LEV recommendation, section 184(c)(5) provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that EPA's finding of SIP inadequacy is to require that States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revise their SIPs to include the LEV program within one year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the finding.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, if EPA is to require that States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt the LEV program and submit SIP revisions by January 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996, then EPA must make a finding of SIP inadequacy no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than January 2, 1995. Delays in an EPA decision could delay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of an approved program, and would further delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits and the degree to which such benefits could contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to timely attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An issue in litigation in New York and Massachusetts has been whether the model year and two-year lead-time requirement
under section 177 may vary for different manufacturers that begin their model years at different times, or whether
the model year begins for purposes of section 177 for all manufacturers as soon as the model year may begin for any manufacturer.

It is not entirely clear whether EPA has discretion to give States less than one full year to submit their SIP revisions.
Under section 110(k)(5), EPA ``may establish reasonable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months after such notice) for
submission of such plan revisions.'' The more specific provision in section 184 that lacks the explicit grant of discretion
from section 110(k)(5) itself arguably indicates that EPA does not have such discretion. EPA requests comment on
this view.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, EPA believes the time when the LEV program would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generate reductions also relates to the locations where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions are needed for purposes of relieving contribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transported pollutants that interfere with timely attainment. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears that the LEV program will generate reductions in time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to help areas to achieve attainment by the severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification deadline of 2005 or 2007. States in the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northeast portion of the OTR, including Rhode Island, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, contain no such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. EPA believes that its recent considerations in response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ozone transport problems in a letter to Senator Carl Levin
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 and in subsequent March 21, 1994 letters to the Massachusetts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Environmental Protection and the Conservation Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foundation (CLF)
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 may be relevant to the timing of LEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions. In particular, certain moderate nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have raised a concern that they may not be able to themselves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt controls to ensure attainment of the ozone standard by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996 deadline for areas classified as moderate because air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution transported from upwind may be the dominant factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting for their nonattainment problem. The solution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplated in the section 184 transport provision is for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible upwind areas to relieve their significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribution so that the downwind areas may attain on time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Still, in certain cases this view could be at odds with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall title I scheme that establishes later deadlines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment in more polluted areas and also establishes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduated program of additional and more stringent requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be accomplished in those areas over the longer time-frame. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accelerating controls in the upwind areas is impracticable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain facts related to ozone transport could be shown, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested it might consider reasonably interpreting the Act to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant the downwind areas additional time to reach attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the dates specified in section 181(a)(1). EPA concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its letters to Senator Levin and the CLF by indicating that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing to develop policy to address this problem. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the relevance of this policy here. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, reductions generated over time through fleet turnover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to vehicles meeting LEV standards could be more important in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisting areas in reaching attainment by later deadlines. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any moderate or serious areas in the OTR have until later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1999 to attain, this could affect the utility of the LEV program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such areas to reach attainment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For episodes in which the long-range transport is from the southwest to the northeast in the OTR, States northeast
of New York and Connecticut would not contribute to nonattainment in any severe nonattainment area. Under these circumstances,
the LEV program in such States would not assist any downwind areas in reaching attainment by the deadlines specified
in the Act. However, past episodes have shown that high concentrations in the severe areas do not always occur only
when the wind blows from the southwest. When the wind blows in the opposite direction from these States into severe
areas to the south, the LEV program in these States could assist the severe areas in reaching attainment. EPA requests
comment on whether it would be appropriate to geographically limit any approval of the recommended LEV program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also considering whether it has discretion to take into account whether the LEV program is necessary for areas
to maintain the ozone NAAQS after achieving attainment. Particularly in the case of motor vehicle standards, whose
benefits require time for the fleet to turn over, taking the OTR's maintenance needs into account could significantly
affect the analysis. The OTC, in its response to comments, noted that LEV is a significant factor in achieving maintenance
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c)(1) specifies on its face that the OTC may develop recommendations for additional control measures
if the OTC determines such measures are ``necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided
by this subpart.'' Identical language appears in section 184(c)(2) to describe EPA's obligation in reviewing the
need for the control measures in the recommendations and a third time in section 184(c)(4) to describe EPA's obligation
to explain why any control measures in the recommendation are not necessary. This language, omitting any reference
to maintenance, unless unintentional, might suggest that Congress designed section 184(c) as a tool to reach attainment
alone, and not to ensure maintenance thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress explicitly addressed maintenance in connection with ozone transport under section 110(a)(2)(D). As discussed
above, if EPA approves the OTC recommendation, under section 184(c)(5) it is to find SIPs inadequate under section
110(a)(2)(D). That latter provision specifies that SIPs are to contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions
that will ``contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State'' with
respect to any primary or secondary NAAQS. To be sure, States continue to have an obligation in any case to comply with
the requirement in section 110(a)(2)(D) to prevent emissions that will interfere with maintenance by any other State.
But the omission of any reference to maintenance in section 184 may indicate that Congress did not intend it to be a proper
basis for OTC recommendations.

One might argue that the need to bring any area in the OTR into timely attainment inherently carries with it the need
to bring such areas ``back'' into attainment if they attain and subsequently relapse into nonattainment again. The
difficulty with such a view, however, is that it seems at odds with the distinction_clearly delineated elsewhere
in the Act_between attainment and maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176A(a) governs the establishment of transport regions, and additions or removals of areas from such regions.
Section 176A(b) governs the establishment of transport commissions for such regions, the representation on and
voting of a commission, and a commission's obligations to assess transport, strategies for addressing it, and to:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A commission under section 176A therefore appears obligated to consider compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D) in
its entirety, including compliance with the requirement to prohibit interference with maintenance by other States.
Section 176A(c) governs requests from the commission to EPA, providing simply that the commission ``established
under subsection (b) may request the Administrator to issue a finding under section [110(k)(5)] that the [SIP] for
one or more of the States in the transport region is substantially inadequate to meet the requirements of section [110(a)(2)(D)].''
That subsection also governs EPA's obligation to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and disapprove a commission's
request within 18 months and to issue a finding of SIP inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) at the time of any approval.
Under section 176A(c), again, the commission's authority to request a finding of inadequacy appears to extend to
all requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), including the obligations relating to maintenance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184 does incorporate portions of section 176A by reference. On this basis, one might argue that Congress intended
the OTC's power under section 184 to be broader than a commission's power under section 176A, and would thus reach maintenance
issues in some manner. Section 184(a) provides that ``a single transport region for ozone (within the meaning of section
[176A(a)])'' for the Northeast States is established by operation of law. That subsection further provides that
the Administrator is to convene the OTC ``required (under section [176A(b)])'' that results from the establishment
by operation of law. These provisions arguably indicate that the OTC under section 184 is also a creature of section
176A, as a transport region ``within the meaning of'' section 176A(b) and ``convened'' under section 176A(b). Indeed,
it is section 176A(b), referenced in section 184(a), that authorizes a commission to make recommendations for measures
needed to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course, section 184(c) sets out a process for the OTC to recommend additional control measures that the States must
adopt ``within one year'' after EPA's approval and finding of SIP inadequacy. Under section 176A, in contrast, EPA's
approval results in a finding of SIP inadequacy but does not result in specific new mandatory control measures. Even
if the OTC here has authority through section 176A to recommend that EPA find SIPs inadequate in relation to maintenance,
section 176A would not appear to provide for EPA to require specific new control measures for maintenance purposes.
Perhaps Congress intended to limit this extra power to create new mandatory control measures to attaining the NAAQS,
but not to extend to maintenance thereafter. It might be reasonable to believe that EPA's difficulty in ensuring attainment
in the Northeast justified this extra invasion into State discretion, but that Congress trusted EPA would be better
able to enforce States' obligations to prevent interference with maintenance elsewhere, once contribution preventing
attainment is addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, in considering the LEV measure, EPA believes that it may consider maintenance in the course of its analysis
here for independent purposes of section 110(a)(2)(D). In other words, EPA's process in responding to the OTC recommendation
may provide an appropriate forum in which to also consider what upwind control measures may be necessary for purposes
of preventing interference with maintenance downwind. Instead of considering what reductions in current emissions
may be necessary to prevent contribution to nonattainment, for maintenance the relevant concern would seem to be
the need for additional controls after attainment to counteract growth and prevent emissions that would cause downwind
areas to relapse into nonattainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it might reasonably determine in this proceeding that States' SIPs would need to control an additional
increment of emissions to prevent interfering with maintenance downwind even after it is achieved. EPA might then
notify States that their SIPs are inadequate to prevent interference with maintenance of the NAAQS. Apart from mandating
particular measures for maintenance under section 184, EPA believes that it could identify the increment of controls
that appear to be ``necessary'' to prevent interference with maintenance downwind, and the measures that appear
``necessary'' to achieve adequate emissions control for this purpose. Under such circumstances, EPA believes it
has independent authority under section 110(k)(5) to insist that States adopt such controls, or other comparably
effective controls, to address the maintenance concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in connection with maintenance, EPA believes that its inability to establish more stringent ``Tier 2''
motor vehicle standards under section 202(i) until model year 2004 is relevant.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 As noted above, under section 202(a), Congress explicitly provided that EPA may not modify the ``Tier 1'' auto emissions
standards specified in subsections 202(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h) and (i) prior to model year 2004. The OTC, in its response
to comments, recognized this limitation. The OTC recommendation calls for the LEV standards to apply beginning in
model year 1999, a full 5 model years earlier than Tier 2 standards could at the earliest apply under section 202(i).
Therefore, EPA should consider the need for LEV standards during those years when Tier 2 could not be available, whether
for purposes of reaching attainment or for maintenance thereafter. The OTC, in its response to comments, contends
that the earlier implementation of LEV is important for severe areas to achieve attainment by 2005 or 2007.

Subsection 202(i) sets out the scheme for EPA to consider and possibly establish more stringent ``Tier 2'' standards
beginning with model year 2004. Under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection 202(i), EPA is to study whether more stringent
``Tier 2'' standards should be adopted beginning with model year 2004, taking into account such factors as the need
for further reductions, technical feasibility, cost, and alternatives. EPA is to submit this study to Congress no
later than June 1, 1997. Under paragraph (3), based on this study EPA is to determine, through rulemaking, whether
to establish more stringent ``Tier 2'' standards to be applicable no earlier than model year 2004 but not later than
model year 2006. Finally, subparagraph (3)(E) provides a default to ``Tier 2'' emissions standards specified in

EPA is considering whether it may account for the possibility of Tier 2 standards beginning with model year 2004 in
analyzing the need for the LEV program. EPA's authority to adopt more stringent Tier 2 standards for model year 2004,
if necessary, may make less pressing a determination now that LEV is necessary for model years 2004 and after. However,
the impact of Tier 2 standards for reaching attainment deadlines in 2005 or 2007 is likely to be small and this consideration
therefore may be more important for purposes of the OTR's maintenance needs. Moreover, EPA is aware that it cannot
prejudge the outcome of the Tier 2 study that is to be the basis for its Tier 2 rulemaking. EPA questions whether it is
at all appropriate for its decision regarding the necessity of the OTC&hyph;LEV program to be influenced by the mere
possibility of future federal regulations, where such regulations are not assured and where states have little to
no control regarding whether such regulations will ever be promulgated. EPA also notes that the issues relevant to
the Tier 2 study are not identical to the issues relevant to the establishment of the OTC&hyph;LEV program. For example,
Tier 2 standards would apply nation-wide, and EPA's analysis would balance the relevant factors on a national scale,
whereas the analysis of need for the OTC's LEV program should be more focused on the OTR.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 184(d), EPA has published criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing transport of ozone and ozone precursors.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria recommend use of trajectory models and timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations to provide a qualitative judgment regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative importance of transport in contributing to an area's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment problem. The OTC, to support its recommendation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relied upon such approaches to establish the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport as a contributing factor to nonattainment in the OTR.

The criteria also identify more quantitative procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering effects of transport in urban scale modeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications applied in SIP attainment demonstrations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria identify use of regional grid photochemical models as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preferred approach for providing quantitative estimates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport. These estimates are used as inputs to urban scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
models, such as the Urban Airshed Model, in order to estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in local emissions and/or transport necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate attainment. Unfortunately, however, urban modeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses using SIP databases are not yet available and are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to be submitted to EPA as part of States' attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrations until November 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, several regional modeling studies have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed to characterize regional transport of ozone in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible to come up with precise control targets for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone precursor emissions from these studies, due to their use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an earlier emission inventory, the broad spatial resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available in the model used and the nature of the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies investigated. Nevertheless, the studies are useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deriving approximate estimates. Further, their credence is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhanced by the fact that they all lead to a consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that a substantial reduction in NO

3. The OTC's Recommended LEV Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. OTC&hyph;LEV Provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The LEV program recommended by the OTC (OTC&hyph;LEV) would apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all 1999 and subsequent model year passenger cars and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light-duty trucks (LDTs) (0&hyph;5750 pounds loaded vehicle weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(LVW)) in the OTR. The OTC&hyph;LEV program would establish five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of vehicles: California ``Tier I'' vehicles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transitional low emission vehicles (TLEVs); low emission vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(LEVs); ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs); and zero emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles (ZEVs). Each vehicle category has specific exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission certification standards for hydrocarbons (expressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of ``non-methane organic gases,'' or ``NMOG''), carbon monoxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), particulate matter (PM) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formaldehyde (HCHO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC&hyph;LEV program would also establish a NMOG ``fleet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average'' requirement that, for passenger cars and small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light-duty trucks (LDTs), would decline from a value of 0.113 gpm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1999 to 0.062 gpm in 2003 and later years. Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be obliged to produce larger percentages of the more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent categories of vehicles (LEVs, ULEVs and ZEVs) in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the increasingly stringent NMOG standard. The program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also includes a slightly higher NMOG fleet average for larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers would be free to decide the mix of vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories they would produce, provided the NMOG fleet average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is met, except that if EPA determines that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California LEV program's ZEV sales requirement must be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the OTC&hyph;LEV program, then manufacturers would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in their vehicle fleet a certain percentage of ZEVs per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year. (The OTC recommendation, barring a determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that section 177 requires the adoption of a ZEV mandate, leaves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decision to adopt a ZEV mandate to the individual states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue will be discussed in the ``Consistency with the Act'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, below.) Under the ZEV sales requirement, when the OTC&hyph;LEV program begins in 1999, two percent of a manufacturer's
sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of light-duty vehicles must be ZEVs. The sales requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases to a maximum of 10 percent of sales for model year 2003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and beyond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC explicitly excluded California reformulated gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements from its recommendation. Also, the OTC&hyph;LEV program is limited to light-duty vehicles and trucks.
The OTC&hyph;LEV program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be enforced by the OTC states.

b. EPA Modeling for the OTC&hyph;LEV Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will use the MOBILE5a emission factor model to quantify the

HC, CO, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions associated with the OTC&hyph;LEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. MOBILE5a incorporates the latest technical information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available on both the expected certification and in-use performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles meeting LEV standards. MOBILE5a uses emission factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equations for each OTC&hyph;LEV exhaust standard, and the proportion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles meeting each of these standards necessary to meet the fleet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average NMOG standard for each model year, to calculate the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of each model year of the LEV program in any calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates emissions reductions for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO, as well as NMOG, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to the lower NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO standards required for vehicles in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC&hyph;LEV program. The emissions factor equations are derived from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering analysis of the performance of vehicles meeting existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust standards and of the effect of new emission controls needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the OTC&hyph;LEV standards. The emission factor equations for LEVs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also take into account differences between certification fuel in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California and the federal fuel which will be used in the OTR. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to evaluate the need for the LEV program to maintain the NAAQS, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to model emissions well past the attainment deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission factors from MOBILE5a are multiplied by vehicle miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traveled (VMT) in order to create emissions inventories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this analysis, EPA will be comparing projected mobile source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inventories in future years with and without the OTC&hyph;LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will follow the same guidance EPA has given the States when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projecting future VMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MOBILE5a has the ability to model a LEV program which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes a ZEV sales mandate or a LEV program without a ZEV sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandate, both meeting the same NMOG fleet average requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To properly quantify the emissions impact of the OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation, EPA will require information on the extent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which ZEVs will be required, as well as information on ZEV usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patterns and on their effect on power plant emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of other programs designed to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from highway vehicles, including federal reformulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel, control of refueling emissions, and transportation control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures (TCMs), that are either mandated by the Clean Air Act in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all or parts of the OTR or are programs that the States may opt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into as part of a SIP. EPA intends to quantify the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions of the OTC&hyph;LEV program, taking into account all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory measures and other regional measures that the OTC has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. The timing of reductions could be accelerated if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States were to adopt schemes to accelerate fleet turnover. But 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these schemes would likely have to be drastic to significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the reductions that the LEV program would generate by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2005. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, EPA believes that evaporative emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California and federal vehicles will be the same, under a given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel and inspection regime. This assumption is reflected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MOBILE5a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One current development that may affect EPA's modeling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTC&hyph;LEV program is California's decision as to whether to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require onboard refueling vapor recovery systems (ORVR) as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its motor vehicle emission program. See CARB Mail-out

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
94&hyph;08, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workshop Notice (Feb. 9, 1994). Should California receive a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver from EPA which would permit them not to require ORVR, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would seem inappropriate to include any emissions benefits from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORVR in modeling the benefits of the California LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that the OTC&hyph;LEVs would have to meet identical standards as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the California vehicles and that the OTC could not require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``third vehicle,'' the OTC&hyph;LEVs could also have no requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onboard systems. The lack of an onboard refueling requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the OTC&hyph;LEV program could affect the emission benefits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LEV program. The issue is related to section 184(b)(2)'s 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that Stage II vehicle refueling provisions, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions capable of achieving comparable emissions reductions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be implemented in the OTR. EPA requests comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect that a California's decision not to require ORVR would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have on EPA's action on the OTC recommendation implications which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this would have for Stage II exemption levels and enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in the OTR.

EPA requests comment and technical data regarding the effect of the OTC-LEV program on emissions in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will also review the cost effectiveness of the OTC&hyph;LEV program. Cost estimates of California's LEV program
have varied greatly. Much of the variation is attributable to different assumptions regarding the necessary technology,
economies of scale, and how development costs should be calculated. During EPA's consideration of California's
waiver for its LEV program, California estimated additional costs to be $170 per car, while the automobile industry
estimated this figure to be over $1000 per car. While both California and the industry have subsequently refined and
reduced their estimates based on new hardware assumptions, the large difference remains an issue. Cost-effectiveness
estimates for the OTC&hyph;LEV program will be somewhat distinct from the California LEV cost-effectiveness estimates
because some or much of the costs that were included in the California LEV estimates, particularly research and development
costs, may be reduced or eliminated in the OTC&hyph;LEV context because the costs have already been expended in developing
the California LEV program. EPA requests comment on cost-effectiveness of the OTC&hyph;LEV program, given the continuing
existence of the California LEV program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The recitation clauses to the OTC recommendation specifically state:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whereas the OTC expects the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through the consultation process provided in
Section 184(c) of the Clean Air Act, to evaluate alternatives (including the program presented by the automobile
manufacturers with enhancements) which are comparable in terms of enforceability, timeliness, and quantity of
emission reductions to those achieved by the OTC LEV program, are consistent with the Clean Air Act, and advances technology.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

auto manufacturers' alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Automobile Manufacturers' Alternative to the OTC's Recommended LEV Program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The American Automobile Manufacturers Association's (AAMA) alternative program to the California LEV program
is known as the Federal LEV or FLEV program. As proposed by the auto manufacturers, manufacturers would provide FLEVs
to all States in the OTC. The FLEV automobiles would meet the following emission standards: 0.125 gpm NMOG; 2.5 gpm
CO; 0.3 gpm NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 100,000 miles; and 0.2 gpm NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 50,000 miles. Light-duty trucks would also have FLEV standards. The FLEV standards would be phased-in, with the
standards applicable to 30% of all new cars in model year 2001, 60% in model year 2002, and 100% in model year 2003. These
standards represent a substantial improvement from the federal Tier I standards (0.25 gpm NMHC, 3.4 gpm CO, 0.4 NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) with which manufacturers must now comply. The standards are, however, less stringent than the federal Tier II ``default''
standards specified in Table 1 in section 202(i)(1) (0.125 gpm NMHC, 1.7 gpm CO, 0.2 gpm NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which cannot apply before model year 2004. They are also less stringent than California's LEV category standards
for NMOG (0.075 gpm at 50,000, 0.090 gpm at 100,000) but more stringent than California's LEV category standards for
CO (3.4 gpm at 50,000, 4.2 gpm at 100,000).

The AAMA proposed that FLEV vehicles would be available nationwide. A sales mandate for ZEVs was not included in the
FLEV proposal. Under the FLEV proposal, manufacturers would certify their vehicles to the FLEV standards, but in-use
standards would remain at the current federal Tier 1 levels through at least model year 2003. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the FLEV program would be implemented through a consent decree settling litigation regarding implementation
of the LEV program in New York and Massachusetts. The consent decree mechanism was proposed based on the contention
that section 202(b)(1)(C) and 202(i) prohibit EPA from imposing the FLEV standards prior to model year 2004 and that
section 209 prohibits States from adopting the FLEV standards. Under the proposal, in addition to the manufacturers'
obligation to provide cars meeting FLEV standards, the consent decree would reflect the States' agreement not to
adopt the LEV program; Massachusetts's and New York's agreement to withdraw their programs; and an agreement that
the manufacturers' obligations to provide FLEV cars would terminate if any State adopted a California LEV program.
While States would have the right to enforce the FLEV program through the court supervising the consent decree, EPA
might provide the information regarding whether particular cars in fact meet the FLEV standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The auto manufacturers proffered their FLEV proposal to the OTC, which determined that it would not achieve the same
level of emission control as the California LEV program. In reaching this conclusion, the OTC emphasized a number
of points in its response to comments document. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under the proposal the FLEV standards would apply two model years later than the OTC&hyph;LEV standards, and would
not be fully implemented until two years thereafter. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the level of NMOG emissions under the FLEV proposal would be considerably higher than under the OTC&hyph;LEV program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 according to the OTC, projections using EPA's MOBILE5 emissions model indicate that in the year 2020, emissions of
hydrocarbons under the OTC&hyph;LEV program will be about 30 percent lower than they would be under the FLEV program,
due largely to the portion of the fleet under the OTC&hyph;LEV program consisting of cars meeting ULEV and ZEV standards.
In sum, the OTC calculates that its LEV program would provide 21 tons per day of VOC reductions and 38 tons per day of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions in the OTR beyond the FLEV proposal.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fourth,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the OTC notes that under the FLEV proposal, the FLEV standards would apply for new car certification, but, until model
year 2004, in-use standards would be the same as the federal Tier I standards. This, according to the OTC, may reduce
the emissions reductions that would otherwise be predicted from the FLEV program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the OTC notes that, since the FLEV proposal is premised on the withdrawal of the now-adopted LEV programs in New York
and Massachusetts, as many as eight or nine years of emissions reductions from those programs would be lost under the
FLEV proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This calculation assumed: (1) ``Maximum'' I/M for under both programs; (2) Federal reformulated gasoline; (3) earlier
introduction of the LEV program. It is unclear whether the calculation assumed the ZEV sales mandate under the OTC&hyph;LEV
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the OTC points out additional benefits of the OTC&hyph;LEV program over the FLEV proposal. These include
the expected increase in use of alternative fuels under the OTC&hyph;LEV program, which will reduce dependence on
foreign oil and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as the benefits of forcing advanced technology, particularly
associated with cars meeting ULEV and ZEV standards. Certain technologies, such as electrically heated catalysts
and hydrocarbon traps would apparently not be needed to meet FLEV standards, nor would electric car technology. Also,
the OTC believes that technologies such as adoptive transient learning controls, dual oxygen sensors, improved
fuel atomization and auxiliary air would not be used commonly for FLEV vehicles. Further, the OTC believes its LEV
program would force advances in battery technologies, and potential initiatives such as hydrogen fuel cells and
fly wheels. (Of course, to the extent a ZEV sales mandate is not part of the OTC LEV program, ZEV technologies may not
be advanced.) EPA seeks comment on the emission control and other benefits of the FLEV program, particularly in comparison
to the OTC&hyph;LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the OTC expressed concerns regarding the enforceability of the FLEV proposal. EPA is likewise concerned
about whether such a program could be adopted and enforced. As noted above, it is likely that EPA could not alter Tier
1 standards prior to model year 2004, and therefore could not impose the FLEV standards before that time. Even beginning
in model year 2004, EPA adoption of standards comparable to the FLEV standards would have to be supported under the
criteria set out in section 202(i) of the Act. As the OTC pointed out, States also cannot adopt or enforce the FLEV standards,
because they cannot adopt any new motor vehicle standards (other than the California standards) under the preemption
provisions of section 209 of the Act. Section 209(a) prohibits States from adopting or attempting to enforce ``any
standard relating to the control of emissions'' from new motor vehicles and also prohibits States from requiring
any approval relating to emissions as a condition precedent to initial retail sale, titling, or registration of new
vehicles.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To establish the legal framework for implementing the FLEV program, the manufacturers have relied on the section
302(k) definition of ``emission standard'' (i.e. ``a requirement established by the State or the Administrator'').
They argue that the consent decree arrangement does not involve an ``emission standard'' since the standards would
not be ``established'' by the State or the Administrator. The applicability of the section 302(k) definition to section
209(a), however, is not clear, since section 209(a) does not use the term ``emission standard'' but rather uses the
perhaps broader language ``any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.'' EPA requests
comment on whether using the consent decree mechanism to establish the FLEV proposal would adequately avoid a conflict
with section 209 and allow States to enforce the FLEV program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consent decree mechanism raises a set of legal concerns. One such concern is whether all the OTC States could become
parties to the consent decree. The auto manufacturers suggest that the OTC States could intervene in the New York or
Massachusetts litigation under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They contend that the OTC States'
October 29, 1991 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that each State in the OTC would take steps to implement California's
LEV program as soon as possible constitutes adequate grounds for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Other
concerns are raised regarding the role of the court in a consent decree. The consent decree mechanism would require
that the court determine that a decree is an appropriate commitment of the court's limited resources. Under the FLEV
proposal, the district court overseeing the consent decree would presumably directly enforce the FLEV standards

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or at the behest of parties to the decree. (The penalties for noncompliance are not clear.) EPA is concerned that supervision
of the FLEV program could require substantial resources from the court. Finally, it is not clear how enforcement would
work if any auto manufacturers refused to sign the consent decree. EPA requests comment on each of these issues, particularly
whether the consent decree mechanism is sufficient for enforcement and on whether the OTC States could intervene
in the litigation under section 24(b) to be able to enforce the decree.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also concerned about its ability to grant SIP credits for emissions reductions under the FLEV proposal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 credits are ordinarily limited to emissions reduction measures that are adopted in a State's SIP, after reasonable
notice and public hearing (as provided in section 110(a)(2) of the Act). One issue is whether under the FLEV proposal,
the emissions controls could be part of the SIP, since to make them part of the SIP could conflict with the preemption
provisions of section 209(a) of the Act. Further, once controls are adopted in the SIP, they are ordinarily federally
enforceable under section 113 of the Act. Under the FLEV proposal, EPA would not be in a position to enforce the controls,
both because the controls would not be in the SIP, and because the auto manufacturers have proposed that EPA not sign
the consent decree. And it is not clear what jurisdiction the court would have to allow EPA to intervene in the New York
or Massachusetts litigation to sign the consent decree, or to otherwise seek judicial enforcement of such a decree.
For OTC States that would not sign the consent decree, it is unclear how such States could seek enforcement of the FLEV
standards, or how EPA could grant SIP credits to them. Finally, the existence of clauses allowing the auto manufacturers
to escape from their obligations to provide cars meeting the FLEV standards under particular circumstances reduces
the certainty of the emissions controls. EPA is concerned that this lack of certainty conflicts with the ordinary
certainty of SIP creditable measures. EPA requests comment on its ability to grant SIP credits for reductions generated
under the FLEV proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Other Measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OTC in its recommendation stated that it expects EPA to evaluate alternatives comparable to the OTC&hyph;LEV
program in terms of enforceability, timeliness, quantity of emissions reductions, consistency with the Act, and
advancement in technology. EPA recognizes that the magnitude of emissions reductions needed to mitigate significant
contribution to nonattainment in the OTR is likely to exceed the reductions that the measures specified in the Act
plus the LEV program will generate. To the extent more reductions will be needed even with the LEV program, other measures
that address that shortfall would not, for that reason alone, qualify as ``alternatives'' to LEV. Rather, other measures
might qualify as ``alternatives'' only if such other measures, singly or in combination, generate enough reductions
to fill the entire shortfall needed without LEV. Any conclusions about what may qualify as ``alternatives,'' therefore,
would depend on a prior evaluation of the magnitude of reductions needed. Once the amount of reductions needed is ascertained,
then the emissions reductions and costs associated with measures other than LEV that could fill the shortfall without
LEV might be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA believes it may be useful to consider the emissions reductions associated with other emission control
measures that the Act specifically mandates for areas in the OTR, for example, reformulated gasoline, enhanced inspection
and maintenance programs, and Stage II refueling vapor recovery controls. While these measures are not ``alternatives''
because they are mandatory, EPA believes that the amount of reductions they will generate is important in evaluating
the magnitude of the shortfall for attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, EPA believes it may evaluate the emissions reductions associated with other measures that the OTC itself is
considering and has agreed to adopt (in addition to the LEV program) or further explore through memoranda of understanding
(MOU), including federal reformulated gasoline in areas where it is not mandatory under the Act, a ``second phase''
of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OTC MOUs signed October 29, 1991, March 10, 1992, and May 18, 1993.) Another source of measures is the menu of options
identified by STAPPA/ALAPCO in a document entitled ``Meeting the 15&hyph;Percent Rate-of-Progress Requirement
Under the Clean Air Act: A Menu of Options'' (September 1993). Finally, measures identified in the recent FIP proposal
for certain areas in California (EPA Air Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;09) could be evaluated. EPA requests comment
on measures from these sources and other potential measures for evaluation that could be alternatives to the recommended
OTC&hyph;LEV program. EPA might evaluate the cost, reasonableness, and other factors associated with these other
measures if they are shown, in fact, to be ``alternatives'' to the LEV program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

B. Consistency With the Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, section 184 requires that in reviewing the recommendation of the OTC, EPA must evaluate whether the
additional control measures are ``otherwise consistent with this Act.'' In particular, the additional control
measures must be consistent with section 177 of the Act, which provides States with the authority to adopt and enforce
emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines if such standards are identical to California standards and
if the State adopts the standards at least two years before the commencement of the model year to which such standards
apply. Also, the State standards must not prohibit the manufacture or sale of California-certified motor vehicles,
nor may they create a ``third car.''

portions of section 177 by their adoption, or their failure to adopt, certain aspects of California's LEV and clean
fuel programs. Many of the issues that have been raised, and to some extent answered, in those cases are likely to be
relevant to EPA's decision in this proceeding. Moreover, certain issues related to section 177 that were not raised
in those proceedings are likely to be relevant to this proceeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act generally preempts States from promulgating or attempting to enforce standards
relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles. However, section 209(b) allows EPA to waive federal
preemption for California under certain circumstances. Section 177 allows other States to promulgate standards
relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles for any model year, and to take other actions otherwise
preempted under section 209(a), if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year,
and (2) California and such State adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as
determined by regulations of the Administrator). Nothing in this section or in Title II of this Act shall be construed
as authorizing any such State to prohibit or limit, directly or indirectly, the manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle
or motor vehicle engine that is certified in California as meeting California standards, or to take any action of any
kind to create, or have the effect of creating, a motor vehicle or engine different than a motor vehicle or engine certified
in California under California standards (a ``third vehicle'') or otherwise create such a ``third vehicle''.

New York and Massachusetts have both promulgated regulations incorporating aspects of California's LEV program
into their State regulations. Manufacturers have made several challenges under section 177 to the State regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, neither New York nor Massachusetts promulgated regulations incorporating California's ``clean
fuel'' provisions. However, both New York and Massachusetts incorporated California's ZEV sales mandate into their
State regulations. Manufacturers challenged the decisions not to incorporate California's fuel requirements
and to incorporate California's ZEV sales mandate, arguing that (1) the clean fuel requirements are an inherent part
of California's automobile emission program and thus are subject to the identicality requirement of section 177;
(2) the failure to incorporate the clean fuel requirements will require the manufacture of a ``third vehicle'' because
the higher sulfur levels in federal fuels may cause problems with certain catalysts and may cause other vehicle problems;
(3) the ZEV sales mandate violates section 177's prohibition on indirect State limitations on the sale of California
vehicles; and 4) the ZEV sales mandate will require manufacture of a ``third vehicle'' in violation of section 177.

Manufacturers also make other challenges related to leadtime that are not likely to be relevant to this proceeding.
The OTC recommendation states that the LEV program will be effective on January 1, 1996. This provides States and manufacturers
with two years of leadtime required under section 177. However, if the OTC&hyph;LEV program does not become effective
for any State until after January 2, 1996, then certain leadtime-related issues raised by manufacturers in the above
court cases may be relevant in subsequent proceeding.

On issue one, both courts ruled that State failure to incorporate California's clean fuel provisions did not violate
the identicality provision of section 177. The courts ruled that since California's clean fuel provisions were part
of California's waiver application under section 209, they are not ``standards&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* for which
a waiver has been granted'' and thus are not subject to the identicality provisions of section 177. State fuel provisions
are addressed in a separate section of the Act, section 211. EPA's

amicus curiae 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
brief to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the First Circuit, EPA argued that Massachusetts' failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt the clean fuels program did not violate the ``third car'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition because (1) manufacturers could not show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Massachusetts' LEV program compels any design change_manufacturers are free to sell cars in Massachusetts that
are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to California cars; (2) manufacturers' testing-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns were not ripe for review; and (3) the term ``third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle'' is applied only to design changes necessary to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification requirements, not minor changes unrelated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting applicable emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On issue three, the Second Circuit found that New York's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of California's ZEV sales mandate did not violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 177's requirement that States not limit, either directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or indirectly, the sale of California cars. The court found that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ZEV mandate did not prevent manufacturers from selling any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California-certified vehicles as long as they also sold the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified percentage of ZEVs. ``Like the third vehicle rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales-limitation rule is designed to reinforce the identicality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. It would be incongruous for us to hold that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[State] wrongly mandated a ZEV sales percentage identical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California's mandate.'' EPA had taken this position in its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
amicus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On issue four, the Second Circuit ruled that New York's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption of the ZEV mandate does not violate the ``third car'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition because New York is administering the mandate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same manner as California and any changes manufacturers make in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their cars to sell them in New York are based on marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions by manufacturers, not a requirement of the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's amicus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
brief was consistent with this result.

4. Issues Implicated by the OTC Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the section 177-related issues briefed in the New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York and Massachusetts cases are also implicated by the OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition. The OTC recommendation, like the New York and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Massachusetts regulations, does not include California's clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel provisions. Moreover, the recommendation states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent that a Zero Emission Vehicle sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement must be a component of a LEV program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted under Section 177, such a requirement shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply. Further, if such a Zero Emission Vehicle sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is not a required component of programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted under Section 177, individual States within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC may at their option include such a requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or economic incentives designed to increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales of ZEVs in the programs they adopt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision relates to the same ZEV-related issues argued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the court cases and also produces several section 177-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues not determined in the court cases. The issue of whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ZEV sales mandate is a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
component in any State LEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program was not addressed by the courts. Section 177 allows a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State to adopt and enforce ``for any model year standards relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to control of emissions from new motor vehicles and *&blank;*&blank;* engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 *&blank;*&blank;* if such standards are identical to the California standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which a waiver has been granted for such model year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first question presented by this issue is whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ZEV sales mandate is a ``standard relating to control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions.'' In letters sent to New York and Virginia State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials on January 7, 1993, EPA stated that it believed the ZEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales mandate ``in light of the existence of the NMOG [non-methane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic gases] fleet average requirement (which is a motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle emission standard), the California ZEV sales requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not a motor vehicle emission standard. Thus, a State which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopts California motor vehicle emission standards is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to, but may, adopt this particular provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California's program. The ZEV sales mandate simply limits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility otherwise accorded manufacturers to choose the mix of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles produced to meet the NMOG fleet average requirement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator made this statement based on EPA's belief that the ZEV sales mandate does not, given the existence
of the NMOG standard, create any additional requirements that will have any effect on NMOG emissions from light-duty
vehicles in California. The ZEV sales mandate does not require that the overall NMOG emissions from California vehicles
be any lower than they would have been in the absence of the sales mandate. The amount of emissions produced by such vehicles
is controlled by the NMOG fleet average requirement, not the sales mandate. The ZEV mandate merely restricts the manufacturers'
choices with regard to the type of vehicle they must produce to meet the NMOG requirement. Therefore, as the ZEV sales
mandate does not limit the quantity, rate or concentration of NMOG emissions, EPA stated that the mandate was not an
emission standard, but instead was an accompanying enforcement procedure. In its recommendation, the OTC States
that the ZEV sales mandate is an accompanying enforcement procedure and is not required by section 177.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether the ZEV sales mandate should be considered an emission standards. EPA is also requesting
comments regarding whether the ZEV sales mandate will have or is likely to have a clear effect on emissions of NOx and
CO, whether such effect is substantial, and whether such a potential effect is relevant to the question of whether
the sales mandate is an emission standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second question presented by this issue is whether States are required under section 177's identicality provision
to promulgate all of California's motor vehicle emission standards for a given model year, or whether only a certain
subset of these regulations must be promulgated. Section 177 provides that a State ``may adopt and enforce *&blank;*&blank;*
standards *&blank;*&blank;* if such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been
granted.'' The statute does not necessarily indicate that if a State adopts one California standard for a year it must
adopt all of them. EPA believes that adoption of the California LEV program does not require adoption of the California
heavy-duty engine program, which deals with different types of vehicles. However, EPA has not finally determined
whether section 177 requires a State to promulgate all California emission standards related to a type of vehicle
once a State has determined that it intends to promulgate any California standards related to that type of vehicle.
Certainly, where a State intends to incorporate some portion of California's emission standards, the State must
promulgate all regulations that are necessary to ensure that California cars are not prohibited from sale in the State
and all regulations necessary to prevent the requirement of a third car. Must a State promulgate all California vehicle-based
emission standards relevant to a particular type of vehicle? May a State promulgate only those provisions necessary
to ensure that the State program receives the emission reductions California receives from its program, or only those
provisions that are central parts of the program? May a State promulgate merely those regulations that ensure that
its program is as protective of the public health and welfare, in the aggregate, as the federal program? Under this
approach, a State would have considerable flexibility to determine which parts of a particular program the State
would promulgate, but the State would not be assured of receiving the same SIP credits as California for such a program.
In addition, this approach may be inconsistent with section 177's goal of preventing myriad different motor vehicle
programs in the several States and also may be inconsistent with the statutory language and the legislative history
of section 177. EPA requests comment on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The identicality issue is also implicated by the form of the OTC's initial recommendation to EPA. The OTC recommendation
states that it intends the OTC-LEV program to be consistent with section 177 and 184 of the Act. The recommendation
also states that the program contains standards identical to the California LEV program. However, rather than directly
incorporating California's regulations into its recommendation, or citing to California's regulations, OTC gave
a brief overview of the parts of California's LEV program it intended to incorporate and the time frame for the regulations.
EPA initially had questions regarding whether the OTC intended to incorporate certain secondary provisions in California's
LEV program into the OTC-LEV program (in particular, the hybrid electric vehicle provisions, banking and trading
of NMOG credits, the small and intermediate volume manufacturer provisions and reactivity adjustment factors).
EPA also had questions regarding whether California's NMOG fleet average requirements were intended to apply to
heavier light-duty trucks (3751&hyph;5750 lbs) and whether the OTC intended medium-duty vehicles to be included
in the LEV program. EPA requested that the OTC clarify these issues, becuase failure to incorporate certain secondary
provisions into the OTC program could conceivably have raised identicality problems. On April 15, 1994 Bruce Carhart
of the OTC sent a letter to EPA stating, in part, the following:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[The OTC has] recommended regulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger cars and light-duty trucks up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5750 lbs. loaded vehicle weight, not medium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duty vehicles. Our intention is to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identicality with California as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Clean Air Act. Our recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes a fleet average for both classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light-duty vehicles (0&hyph;3750 and 3751&hyph;5750 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lbs.); hybrid electric vehicles, in as far as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California has classified and certified such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles; banking and trading provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the fleet average; the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensions and exemptions for intermediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and small manufacturers; and RAFs as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for certification by California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the details of the above and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other issues can be worked out through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation process as required by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184 of the Clean Air Act.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA requests comment on whether there are other concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the identicality of the OTC-LEV program with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California LEV program. EPA also requests comment on whether EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can assume that, on provisions on which OTC is silent, OTC means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require all provisions that are necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identicality and that such provisions must be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue in this rulemaking is whether the OTC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporation of California's NMOG fleet average provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violates any portion of section 177. In their response to OTC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated intention to include the NMOG fleet average program in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC-LEV program, some manufacturers claimed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporation of the NMOG standard would violate section 177. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC found that the NMOG fleet average did not violate section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
177 and that States may enforce these standards, consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California protocols and testing requirements. EPA believes, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reasons given by the Second Circuit in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MVMA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
case in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of the ZEV sales mandate, that the fleet average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement does not violate the requirement of section 177 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States shall not prohibit the sale of California cars. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, EPA has no evidence contrary to the OTC's determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the fleet average requirement does not violate the ``third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle'' prohibition of section 177. EPA also agrees that States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are permitted to enforce this requirement, consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California protocols and requirements. EPA believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMOG fleet average requirement is the heart of the California LEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and is the central mechanism for ensuring reductions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program, and that any State program implementing the LEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program should, and is probably compelled to, include enforceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMOG fleet average requirements. EPA requests comment on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues. EPA also requests comment regarding whether the NMOG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fleet average requirement must be met statewide or whether it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be met regionwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA requests comment on the OTC statement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 177 does not require a State to adopt the California LEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program in all areas of a State. OTC's statement is consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with EPA's interpretation of section 177, as illustrated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator Reilly's response to Elizabeth Haskell, Virginia's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of Natural Resources, in which the Administrator noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adoption of California emission standards in part of a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with section 177's title, ``New Motor Vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards in Nonattainment Areas.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not at this time have any questions regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC recommendation's consistency with any other sections of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act. EPA requests comment on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation may be inconsistent with any other section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel or policy issues arising out of legal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, since this

action could result in a rule that could have a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact, this notice was submitted to OMB for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to prepare an economic analysis under E.O. 12866 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any final rule that is a significant regulatory action. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written comments to EPA and any written EPA responses to those

VI. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that, whenever an agency is required to publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general notice of rulemaking, it must prepare and make available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). While EPA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow rulemaking procedures under section 307(d) of the Clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Act, EPA believes it is not legally 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general notice of rulemaking here, and hence that it need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare a RFA. But even if EPA is required to publish a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of rulemaking here, a RFA is required only for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities which are directly regulated by the rule. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on regulated entities and not indirect impact on small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not regulated). The OTC's recommended LEV program would directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate auto manufacturers. Since these auto manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally do not qualify as small businesses within the meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA does not believe a RFA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for either the proposed or final rules, even if rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whereas, the States composing the Ozone Transport Region (OTR)* are faced with a pervasive ozone nonattainment problem;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas regional ozone modeling to date has shown the need for emission reductions beyond those which will be realized
through the strategies specifically included in the Clean Air Act; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the Clean Air Act, provides the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) with a mechanism under Section 184(c) to
review and recommend additional control measures in all or part of the OTR to control regional ozone; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas motor vehicles, in the aggregate, are the single largest source of ozone precursors within the OTR, and introduction
of Low Emission and Zero Emission Vehicles are essential; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the Clean Air Act also grants States under Section 177 the option of adopting more stringent Low Emission Vehicle
(LEV) standards for new motor vehicles; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas based on the technical analysis done by the States of the OTC to date LEVs provide substantial and cost effective
emission reductions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the OTC under Section 184(c) proposed on November 17, 1993, a regional LEV program, hereafter known as the
Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (OTC LEV) program, after having been petitioned by three OTC States
to consider developing such a recommendation; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the OTC provided at that time notice and opportunity for public comment as required by Section 184(c) of the
Clean Air Act, including a public hearing in Hartford, Connecticut, on December 16&hyph;17, 1993, and has analyzed
and responded to the comments received in the attached Response to Comments: and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the OTC has analyzed the impact and need for LEV in the OTR as documented in the attached Technical Support Document;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, and Vermont, the District of Columbia, and the part of Virginia within the Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area which includes the District of Columbia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the OTC received and analyzed an alternative proposal from the automobile manufacturers which, while an
improvement over Tier I Federal vehicles, would require programmatic and timing enhancements and the addition of
an electric vehicle component to ensure that enforceable vehicle emission reductions comparable to those achieved
by the OTC LEV program could be achieved in a more timely manner; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the OTC expects the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through the consultation process provided in
Section 184(c) of the Clean Air Act, to evaluate alternatives (including the program presented by the automobile
manufacturers with enhancements) which are comparable in terms of enforceability, timeliness, and quantity of
emission reduction to those achieved by the OTC LEV program, are consistent with the Clean Air Act, and advances technology;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Ozone Transport Commission determines that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional LEV program, the OTC LEV program, is necessary to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Ozone Transport Region into attainment by the dates provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Clean Air Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, that by majority vote of the States of the Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Commission, as indicated by the attached signature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheet, the Ozone Transport Commission transmits the attached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategy recommendation regarding the OTC LEV program to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore that adoption of this recommendation by the Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Commission or approval of this recommendation by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will not require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption of California reformulated gasoline standards by any X 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the OTR; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore that as a part of this submittal, the Ozone Transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission includes the attached Response to Comments received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the public's opportunity to comment on this matter, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the attached Technical Support Document which addresses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Section 184(d) of the Clean Air Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore that the Ozone Transport Commission will participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully in the consultation process on this recommendation with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as provided in Section 1184(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.

Text of February 1, 1994, Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Ozone Transport Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) has developed the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation for an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle (OTC LEV) program which is to be submitted to the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Protection Agency under Section 184(c) of the Clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Act (CAA). The legal authority for the OTC recommendation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described under Section 184(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act and could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in a Federal requirement for regionwide adoption and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement of motor vehicle emission standards available under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 177 of the Clean Air Act. The recommendation is as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section 184(c) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozone Transport Commission hereby recommends adoption of an Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle program including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements described below for the geographic region designated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Ozone Transport Region, defined as the States of Connecticut, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District of Columbia and that part of Virginia within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area which includes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District of Columbia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of this recommendation by the Ozone Transport Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the United States Environmental Protection Agency will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the adoption of the California Reformulated Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards by any State, Commonwealth, or jurisdiction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozone Transport Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Elements of the Proposed OTC LEV Program Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 177 of the Clean Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, the Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LEV) program is applicable to all 1999 and subsequent model year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger cars and light duty trucks (0&hyph;557550 pounds loaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle weight) in the Ozone Transport Region (OTR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions Requirements and Prohibition: No corporation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person or other entity shall sell, import, deliver, purchase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lease, rent, acquire, receive, or register a new vehicle subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the OTC LEV program in the OTR that has not received a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California ARB Executive Order, unless the vehicle is sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from one dealer to another dealer, sold for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being wrecked or dismantled, sold exclusively for off-highway use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or sold for registration out of the OTR, as well as a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased by a nonresident prior to establishing residency or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle transfer by inheritance, decree of divorce, dissolution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or legal separation. Other exceptions would include motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles held for daily lease or rental to the general public or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in interstate commerce that are registered and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principally operated outside the OTR and motor vehicles defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as test vehicles, emergency vehicles, or qualifying for exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Section 43656 of the California Health and Safety Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC LEV program will allow five categories of vehicles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Tier I Vehicles, Transitional Low Emission Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TLEV), Low Emission Vehicles (LEV), Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ULEV) and Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). Manufacturers may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose any combination of vehicles certified to the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, to meet a prescribed fleet emission average standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effective date for the OTC/state implementation of the OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LEV program is January 1, 1996. This schedule allows for notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to manufacturers of two vehicle model years and requires sales of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaner vehicles for the 1999 model year. The OTC LEV program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not affect or preclude States from earlier implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program includes a fleet non-methane organic gases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission average as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to
attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation
of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this
PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business
assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of Title V of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section
507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of
the following PROGRAM elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDEP has met the following requirements of section 507 of Title V of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements
the following required PROGRAM elements and implementation schedules. The PROGRAM will be fully implemented by
November 15, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
compliance 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to comply with them,
EPA believes that the state PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general
principles of these federal statutes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDEP has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility
of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria
in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections
507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A process for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA
and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment,
of any category or subcategory of sources that the FDEP determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities
to meet the requirements of the CAA.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Florida through the FDEP.
The public should be advised that, to be considered, comments must be received by May 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on US EPA's request. This
request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30,
1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By today's action, EPA is proposing to approve a PROGRAM created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program does not impose any new regulatory burden on small
businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the
state. Therefore, because the EPA's proposed approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing regulations that will apply to the pharmaceuticals
manufacturing industry. The regulations are scheduled to be proposed in August 1994, and EPA is sponsoring a public
meeting prior to proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards under authority of the clean Water Act. The Agency
plans to proceed with this rulemaking and coordinate this effort with the development of maximum achievable control
technology standards under authority of the Clean Water Act. These standards are due to be developed on a separate
schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public meeting is intended to be a forum in which EPA can report on the status of regulatory development and in which
interested parties can provide information and ideas on key technical, scientific, and other issues. Other agenda
topics for this public meeting include a summary of data collection activities, options development and preliminary
technology-based options selection. A document relating to the above topics and a more detailed agenda will be available
at the meeting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes to require Type 2 safety belts either to be integrated with the vehicle seat or to provide a means
of adjustability to improve the fit and increase the comfort of the belt for a variety of different sized occupants.
NHTSA believes that some occupants who find their safety belts to be uncomfortable, either wear their safety belts
incorrectly or do not wear their safety belts. NHTSA believes that improving safety belt fit will encourage the correct
use of safety belts and could have the potential to increase the overall safety belt usage rate.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2503(4) of the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991'' requires the NHTSA to address
the matter of improved design for safety belts (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240). In response to this statutory mandate, NHTSA
issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22687). The ANPRM listed three rulemaking
options and posed ten questions. The options included:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Take No Regulatory Action at This Time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Adopt Detailed Regulatory Requirements to Ensure Proper Belt Fit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Adopt a General Requirement that Safety Belts Adjust to Fit Different Sized Occupants.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ten questions asked for information on costs and benefits, and for comments on the test procedure. The ANPRM also
included a discussion of the types of complaints the agency receives concerning belt fit. Finally, the ANPRM explained
that any proposal addressing safety belt fit will encourage the correct use of safety belts and could have the potential
to increase safety belt use. Of those persons who currently do not use safety belts because of improper fit, some would
respond to the improved fit by beginning to use their belts or by wearing them more frequently.

Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the ANPRM, the agency has conducted research on the issue of safety belt fit. A detailed discussion of this research
can be found in a technical paper titled ``Improved Design for Safety Belts,'' a copy of which has been placed in the
docket for this rulemaking. For this paper, the agency surveyed eight vehicles with non-adjustable shoulder belts
and seven vehicles with various types of adjustable shoulder belts to determine how well the belts fit a family of dummies
(the six-year-old, the 5th percentile female, the 50th percentile male, and the 95th percentile male). The survey
used the comfort zone described in the ANPRM (Option B), modified as appropriate for the different sized dummies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the vehicles with non-adjustable shoulder belts, the belt was within the comfort zone 32.3 percent of the time for
the six-year-old dummy, 94.3 percent for the 5th percentile female, 51.2 percent for the 50th percentile male, and
57.1 percent for the 95th percentile male. For the adult dummies, these results do not correlate with the pattern of
belt fit complaints received by the agency. The complaints are often from shorter adults, suggesting that height
may not be the only factor that affects safety belt fit. For example, the agency observed that, for two persons of the
same height, the belt path was higher (approaching the neck) on the person with a larger torso. The agency also observed
that belts tend to ride higher on the torso as the relative position of the belt anchorage and seat are changed so that
the anchorage is farther to the rear in relation to the seat. This movement of the belt occurs because the belt tends
to seek the straightest line path between its anchorages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In vehicles with adjustable shoulder belts, the belts were within the comfort zone 33.3 percent of the time for the
six-year-old dummy, 95 percent for the 5th percentile female, 85.7 percent for the 50th percentile male, and 100 percent
for the 95th percentile male. These results show that currently available adjustable shoulder belt designs do improve
safety belt fit for adults. The significantly lower percentage of both non-adjustable and adjustable belts within
the comfort zone for the six-year-old dummy suggests that additional means, such as booster seats, are necessary
for comfortable belt fit for such persons. Booster seats will raise the proper fit to over 80 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also considered the effectiveness of integrating safety belts into seats to provide the necessary comfort.
During the research, the agency was able to gain access to only a single vehicle equipped with an integrated safety
belt: The Mercedes Benz 500SL convertible. This particular system also included an upper adjustable anchorage on
the seat. The survey of adult human subjects indicated the safety belt did fit the range of adult occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The vehicles with adjustable shoulder belts were also surveyed using live test subjects having the approximate physical
dimensions of the six-year-old, 5th percentile female, 50th percentile male, and 95th percentile male dummies.
The six-year-old human test subject reported a good fit 10.5 percent of the time, and the 50th percentile male test
subject 95.7 percent of the time, while the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male test subjects reported
a good fit 100 percent of the time. These results also support the agency's conclusion that adjustable shoulder belts
can fit a wide range of adult occupants.

The agency received 33 comments in response to the ANPRM. In general, the commenting manufacturers did not support
continuation of this rulemaking, while commenting consumer advocates believed that the agency should address the
issue of belt fit. Commenters did not provide any information on potential benefits other than anecdotal information
from consumer surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of questions were raised concerning the test procedure for Option B. Some commenters stated that it was not
appropriate to test the six-year-old dummy in the driver's seat. Other commenters stated that the 95th percentile
adult male dummy might not fit in some rear seats. A number of comments were also received concerning the positioning
procedures for the dummies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also raised questions concerning the test zone described in the ANPRM. NHTSA reviewed the test zone as
part of the research described above and found that the shoulder zone was redundant and the chest zone was mislocated
on some dummies (e.g., the chest zone intersected the neck of the six-year-old dummy). Therefore, for the research,
the sternum reference point and the width of the shoulder zone were modified for each dummy, using the sitting height
listed in S7.1.3 of Standard No. 208 as a guide to adjust the measurement in reference to the 50th percentile male dummy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that attempts to improve seat belt fit through providing means of adjustability
could lead to misadjustment of belts, which could, in turn, increase the potential for injury. The agency conducted
dynamic sled tests simulating a 48.3 km/h barrier impact using adjustable shoulder belts that were improperly positioned.
In some cases dummy measurements improved, while in other cases measurements were worse. However, it should be stressed
that these results were based on an adjustable belt range of approximately 16 centimeters, which is much greater than
the adjustment available in current vehicles or that is required by this proposal. At this time, the agency does not
have any information on the effect of an adjustment in the 5 centimeter range on dummy measurements.

Proposal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the comments and the research results, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that belts which provide
better fit, would, in turn, promote increased belt usage. Accordingly, the agency is proposing to require Type 2 safety
belts either to be integrated with the vehicle seat or provide a means of adjustability to improve the fit and increase
the comfort of the belt for a variety of different sized occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has decided not to propose detailed requirements. First, the detailed test procedure in the ANPRM would
not provide an adequate means of identifying improper fit on the wide variety of sizes and shapes of vehicle occupants.
As discussed above, the agency research showed that the proposed test procedure, using test dummies, had a much different
result than the comfort levels reported by human subjects during the research survey. The human adults were more comfortable
with the safety belt fit than the dummy fit indicated. Conversely, the human child discomfort and misfit were much
worse than the dummy fit indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, the results of the agency's research lead to the conclusion that currently available non-adjustable belts
fit small adults better than they fit large adults. This does not correlate well with the complaints received by the
agency. For these reasons, the agency does not believe that the test procedure suggested in the ANPRM addresses the
cause of real-world fit problems. In addition, comments to the ANPRM raised a number of unresolved questions concerning
the test procedure. These include a potentially uncomfortable location of the test zone on human subjects, the need
to develop positioning procedures for the various dummies, and the need to develop and add specifications for the
5th percentile female and 95th percentile male dummies in 49 CFR Part 572.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has examined a number of different vehicles that provide some means of adjusting the shoulder belt portion
of the safety belt. For example, Volvo offers a design in which the shoulder belt webbing is fed through a slot in the
pillar at different angles as increasing amounts of webbing are spooled off the retractor. A number of manufacturers
offer a design in which the upper anchorage can be manually moved vertically to a set number of positions. Mercedes
Benz offers similar designs which adjust automatically as either the seat or head rest position is adjusted. Another
design used to maintain proper shoulder belt position is a design in which the inboard anchorage is mounted on the seat
and moves with the seat, while the outboard anchorage is mounted on the vehicle chassis. Some manufacturers have chosen
to use both an upper adjustable anchorage and an inboard movable anchorage on the same safety belt. NHTSA believes
that all of these designs offer good degrees of adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, some manufacturers have safety belts integrated with the seats. While the anchorages for these belts
are not adjustable, this type of belt appears to provide a good fit for a wide range of occupants because the upper and
lower anchorages maintain a constant position relative to the seat and the occupant, regardless of the seat adjustment.
As a result of being on the seat, the upper anchorage is typically farther forward relative to the occupant than is the
upper anchorage for belts that are neither adjustable nor integrated. As a result, the belt does not ride as high as
it attempts to seek the straightest line between the anchorages. As discussed previously in this notice, the agency's
research noted this problem with belt anchorages that were far behind the occupant. Therefore, NHTSA is proposing
that a Type 2 safety belt must either be equipped with an adjustable anchorage or be integrated with the seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that a general requirement that belts be adjustable would not be effective because it would
allow manufacturers to call any design with any degree of movement an ``adjustable'' belt. They could do this even
if the amount of adjustability did not improve safety belt fit for many occupants. NHTSA has observed some safety belt
designs that might be considered meeting a broad definition of ``adjustable'' (e.g., rotating D-rings), but which
NHTSA believes do not offer sufficient adjustment to ensure that the belts would fit a wide range of occupants. Agency
research found that on eight different designs of upper adjustable anchorages, the overall anchorage travel ranged
from 5.8 centimeters to 10.1 centimeters. For inboard movable anchorages, the anchorages all moved more than 19 centimeters,
always the entire distance of seat travel. Conversely, the rotating D-rings provide no travel. Therefore, the value
of five centimeters appears to be a reasonable lower limit for anchorage adjustment. For this reason, NHTSA is specifying
that manufacturers installing a means of adjustment must use designs that provide at least five centimeters of adjustability.
NHTSA believes that all of the effective designs discussed above provide at least this amount of adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the adjustable belts currently available are installed at front seating positions. For the rear seats, NHTSA
is aware of General Motor's ``Child Rerouter.'' This design utilizes a clip through which the shoulder belt can be
routed to change the shoulder belt angle. NHTSA is also aware of the integrated safety belt on the rear seat of the Volvo
850 station wagon. Also, a few Mercedes Benz models (300S, 300SE) incorporate automatically adjusting shoulder
anchorages in the rear seat. NHTSA requests comments on various designs that may be used to comply with the proposed
requirements in the rear seats, the practicability of these designs, and the costs of these designs. NHTSA requests
comments on the need for better belt fit for adults at rear seating positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously in this notice, NHTSA's research shows that this requirement alone will not be sufficient
to address belt fit problems of small children. The agency believes that the need exists for the use of belt-positioning
child booster seats or another means of achieving a good fit, adjustability of the safety belt alone is not sufficient.
The agency has recently published an NPRM, also mandated by the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991,'' to address issues related to belt-positioning child booster seats (58 FR 46928; September 3, 1993).
The NPRM proposed to amend Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' to permit the manufacture and sale of belt-positioning
seats by removing the impediments in the current standard to the production of these seats. The proposal included
a test procedure and labeling/informational requirements. The comments received on that notice are currently being
evaluated by the agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA also requests comments on the regulatory language proposed in this notice. Are there any safety belt designs
that adjust to fit a wide range of occupants but which might not be considered as complying with this proposal? Is there
any design that could fall within the language of the proposal but which a commenter believes should not be allowed
because it does not fit a sufficiently wide variety of occupants? NHTSA requests that commenters address both why
a design does (or doesn't) comply with the proposed requirements and why the design should (or shouldn't) be allowed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA discussed in the ANPRM the increased number of complaints concerning safety belt fit in recent years. The agency
stated improving safety belt fit should increase belt usage and that increased usage would, in turn, yield safety
benefits. At the same time, the agency noted that there might be adverse safety consequences if belts were not adjusted
by each successive user to provide the appropriate fit. NHTSA asked whether it was possible to quantify the benefits
of a rule on improved safety belt fit, and specifically whether any relevant studies or other data were available.
The agency did not receive any data or analysis regarding the issue of benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, NHTSA again asks commenters to address this issue. Would the rule lead to an increase in belt usage? Would
the rule result in a reduction in belt misuse? For example, would it reduce the instances in which occupants place the
shoulder belt portion of a lap/shoulder belt behind their backs or under their arms? What would be the net effect of
the rule on safety? What relevant studies and data exist? For example, do vehicle manufacturers have any information
showing a decrease in complaints about safety belt fit after vehicle models have been equipped with adjustable shoulder
belts? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that occupants need to have information available on the proper use of belt adjustment devices. However,
NHTSA also believes that the new labeling requirements for air bags should be the focus for information in the vehicle.
Therefore, NHTSA is not proposing a requirement to label vehicles but is proposing instead to require information
instructions on proper use in the owner's manual for vehicles with manually adjustable belts. Because the occupant
does not have to take any action to ensure proper fit, devices which provide automatic adjustment, including integrated
seats, would not need such instructions. In addition, NHTSA is not proposing specific language for this requirement
as NHTSA believes that manufacturers are in the best position to determine the best means of providing this information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, the agency proposes to make this amendment effective September 1, 1996. NHTSA believes many vehicles,
currently or in the near future, will comply with this safety belt comfort and fit requirement to satisfy consumer
demand. Additionally, this date is concurrent with the beginning of the required phase-in of manual safety belts
and air bags. Manufacturers will be able to take advantage of the redesign process necessary for the air bag requirement
to also make any design changes necessary to comply with this safety belt fit requirement. Considering these two factors,
the agency believes that two years leadtime would be sufficient.

NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. NHTSA estimates that the annual economic impact of this proposed rule would be between $69
and $92 million. The range reflects cost estimates from NHTSA and the manufacturers, respectively, and baseline
use of technologies as of model year 1992 vehicles. The cost estimates assume adjustable upper anchorages will be
used in the front seat of 4-door vehicles and other vehicles with B-pillars close to the front seat occupant (e.g.,
pickups and vans), and seat-frame-mounted anchorages for the front seat of 2-door vehicles. Child rerouters are
assumed to be used in the rear seats of all vehicles with rear seating positions. If all occupants that currently wear
their belt incorrectly wore their belt correctly, an estimated 33 lives could be saved and 833 moderate to critical
injuries could be reduced annually.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations in central California do not constitute
a ``species'' under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and, therefore, do not qualify for listing under the ESA at this
time. However, as part of a coast-wide status review NMFS is conducting of coho salmon populations in California,
Idaho, Oregon and Washington, NMFS will determine if the two California populations are part of a larger evolutionarily
significant unit that qualifies for protection under the ESA. A review of Oregon coho salmon stocks is expected to
be completed in July 1994 and all stocks by October 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 11, 1993, NMFS received a petition from the Santa Cruz County Planning Department (petitioner) to add naturally
spawning Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oncorhynchus kisutch
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to the list of threatened and endangered species and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The petition contained
information on electrofishing and trapping catch data to demonstrate declining population trends; provided information
on geographic location, spawning distribution, and anadromous life history to illustrate evolutionary significance;
and provided information on geographical isolation, distinctive life history and body size characteristics, and
effects of hatchery fish to illustrate reproductive isolation. NMFS published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document (58 FR 33605, June 18, 1993) indicating that the petition presented substantial scientific information
that suggested listing might be warranted. To ensure a comprehensive review, NMFS solicited information and data
concerning the present and historic status of the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon, and whether this stock qualifies
as a ``species'' under the ESA. NMFS also requested information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for the
Scott Creek and Waddell Creeks coho salmon. NMFS obtained information and data from several State, Federal, and local
sources concerning the historic and present coho salmon abundance and distribution, water quality, fishery management
practices, land management practices, hatchery management impacts, life history characteristics, and stock identification.

The NMFS Southwest Region prepared a technical report entitled: ``Status Review for Scott Creek and Waddell Creek
Coho Salmon'', which provides more detailed information, discussion, and references. The report is available upon
request (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and is summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scott Creek and Waddell Creek are neighboring watersheds that flow into the Pacific Ocean within 4 miles of one another.
These two streams are located on the north coast of Santa Cruz County approximately 15 miles to the north of the City
of Santa Cruz, California. Scott Creek's main stem is 18 miles long, with 35 miles of tributary length, and a watershed
that covers 35 square miles. Waddell Creek's main stem is 12 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long, with 45 miles of tributary length, and a watershed that covers 26 square miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Coho salmon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oncorhynchus kisutch
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are anadromous along the Pacific coast from Chamalu Bay, Mexico, to Point Hope, Alaska, through the Aleutians, and
from the Anadyr River, U.S.S.R., south to Hokkaido, Japan. In California, coho salmon historically used most of the
accessible coastal streams from Monterey County north to the Oregon border.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two basic life history spawning strategies for coho salmon: Short-run populations which utilize the smaller
coastal streams, and long-run coho that will migrate up to 320 miles to utilize tributaries of large coastal rivers.
Coho salmon may begin to enter freshwater in September but usually enter from October to March, peaking in December
and January. In Scott and Waddell Creeks, spawning of coho salmon primarily takes place from the end of December through
mid-February, usually coinciding with increased storm flows. After spending one year in freshwater, juvenile coho
salmon migrate to sea where they usually spend two growing seasons before they return as adults to freshwater to spawn
as 3-year-old fish. A relatively small portion of adult male coho salmon return to spawn after only one year at sea,
and are termed jacks or grilses.

Consideration as a ``Species'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To qualify for listing as a threatened or endangered species, the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations
would have to be a ``species'' under the ESA. The ESA defines a ``species'' to include any ``distinct population segment
of any species of vertebrate *&blank;*&blank;* which interbreeds when mature.'' NMFS published a policy (November
20, 1991; 56 FR 58612) on how it will apply the ESA species definition in evaluating Pacific salmon. This policy states
that a salmon population will be considered distinct, and hence a species under the ESA, if it represents an evolutionarily
significant unit (ESU) of the biological species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It must be reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It must represent an important component in the evolutionary legacy of the biological species. The first criterion,
reproductive isolation, need not be absolute, but must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences
to accrue in different population units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second criterion is met if the population contributed substantially to the ecological/genetic diversity of
the species as a whole. Further guidance on the application of this policy is contained in, ``Pacific salmon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oncorhynchus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act,'' which is available upon request (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

Reproductive Isolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For this criterion, NMFS considered information provided by the petitioner, information provided by knowledgeable
sources, scientific documents, and commercial reports concerning the isolation of Scott and Waddell Creeks from
other coho salmon spawning streams, the distance of the Scott and Waddell Creek populations to other coho salmon populations,
the time of peak spawning, and a north-south genetic difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Available information does not make a strong case for reproductive isolation of Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marked coho salmon from Scott and Waddell Creeks have been caught in the Noyo River 200 miles to the north near Fort Bragg,
CA, and in the San Lorenzo River 15 miles to the south in the City of Santa Cruz, CA. Therefore, distance in the ocean is
not a good measure of reproductive isolation from other coho salmon populations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The San Lorenzo River coho salmon population is primarily a hatchery maintained population that has been extensively
stocked with coho salmon from numerous other northern watersheds for over 70 years. Although the loss of other coho
salmon populations south of San Francisco Bay has isolated these populations, the distance of the Scott and Waddell
Creeks populations to other north-coast coho salmon streams is well within their migration range based on their reported
straying over the last 50 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many small coastal streams in California and Oregon are closed by sand bars at their mouths during a portion of the year.
Generally, fish cannot enter the stream until the sand bar is broken, usually by the first heavy rains. Although the
formation of a sand bar may temporarily act as a migration barrier, it does not represent a reproductive isolation
mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timing of coho salmon spawning runs may be partly genetically based, but it is also subject to modification by streamflow,
water temperature, and other environmental variables. Data from other river systems indicate that the timing of
spawning migrations is generally attributed to an increase of stormflow runoff (usually occurring earlier in the
northern range of coho salmon populations), which allows the salmon to migrate through the lagoons/estuaries and
higher up the river systems to their natal tributaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since studies in the 1930's and 1940's, there has been an apparent shift in peak spawning migration timing by coho salmon
in Scott and Waddell Creeks to several weeks later in the season. Spawning migrations in most California coastal streams
and rivers have shifted to later in the spawning season, possibly due to degraded conditions within the watersheds,
rivers, and estuaries. The loss of large woody debris within stream systems which helps flush out sediment and creates
deep holding pools, excessive diversion of drought limited flows which increases water temperatures, and a reduction
in area and volume of most estuaries and rivers due to filling with sediment, may have created conditions in which coho
salmon can no longer access or survive in rivers until the start of heavy winter rains. Although other explanations
are possible, the year-to-year variation in the timing of coho spawning migrations in Scott and Waddell Creeks are
similar and within the range of run times reported for other coho salmon populations in California and Oregon. The
modest difference in peak spawn timing cited by the petitioner may reflect (or may be the result of) reproductive isolation,
but the best available data is inconclusive regarding the cause of this difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner cited evidence for the existence of a genetic difference between the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho
salmon populations and other coho salmon populations in California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the results from the genetic study cited by the petitioner showed that the greatest differentiation, though
quite low, was between Scott Creek and Waddell Creek, the two California populations that are in the closest proximity.
The results from the limited number of allozyme studies conducted on coho salmon populations in California are similar
to those obtained for coho populations in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Little pattern in the distribution
of variant alleles or genetic variation was observed, and only weak associations between genetic identity and geographic
location were found. The estimated average number of individuals exchanging genes among the California populations
of coho salmon studied was greater than 1.0 fish per generation, which is large enough to prevent the tendency for fixation
of different alleles in different populations. Overall, the genetic data compiled for this status review failed
to demonstrate that the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations as a group are distinct from other coastal
coho salmon populations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Evolutionary Significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS considered information provided by the petitioner on distinctive differences in habitat characteristics
and life history traits between Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon and other California coho salmon populations,
as well as the effects of hatchery influence on these populations. Distinctive differences in habitat characteristics
included spawning in habitats characterized by highly mobile sediment bedloads and extreme hydrological cycles.
Distinctive life history characteristics included the reduced number of eggs produced by female coho salmon that
spawn in Scott and Waddell Creeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the habitat characteristics and life history traits exhibited by coho salmon in Scott and Waddell Creeks are
found in other coho salmon populations in California. Many of the streams and rivers in California exhibit similar
elevated summer/fall water temperatures and extreme winter-flow bedload movements and hydrologic cycles. The
extreme hydrologic cycles and resultant bedload movement found in Scott and Waddell Creeks undoubtedly affect the
success of early spawning coho salmon in these watersheds. However, these conditions are similar to those found in
most of California's coastal streams and rivers. Excessive use or diversion of drought limited flows in Scott and
Waddell Creeks, as well as other systems, has probably exacerbated the problems created by poor land use management
and stream habitat conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, we have no data to indicate that Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon egg production is related to the smaller
average size of these fish in comparison to other coastal coho salmon populations. The number of eggs produced by a
female coho salmon, in and by itself, does not indicate that there are differences between populations from other
watersheds. Each river system is highly variable in year to year production and a smaller size of adult spawner may
result from the overharvesting of larger individuals. The number of eggs produced by Scott Creek and Waddell Creek
coho salmon were within the range reported from other coho salmon populations along the entire west coast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS found some records of hatchery releases of other coho salmon stocks into Scott and Waddell Creeks, as well as most
of the central California coastal streams, from the early 1900's through the early 1970's. The limited number of fish
stocking records indicated that Scott and Waddell Creeks were planted with approximately a total of 500,000 and 130,000
coho salmon fry and juveniles, respectively, from numerous other watersheds. More than 2,000,000 coho salmon fry
and juveniles have been planted in Santa Cruz County streams with coho salmon stocks from Washington, Oregon, and
northern California. The magnitude (and likely effect) of early coho salmon fry releases was probably fairly small.
However, starting in the 1950's, extensive juvenile coho salmon plants began. Even though Scott and Waddell Creeks
have not been planted with outside sources of coho salmon since the early to mid-1970's, the effects of continuous
hatchery plants prior to that time may have affected any distinctive phenotypic and life history traits that originally
existed in these populations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough analysis of all information available, NMFS has determined that the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho
salmon populations do not represent a ``species'' under the ESA. Therefore, a proposal to list these populations
under the ESA is not warranted at this time. However, these populations may be part of a larger ESU whose extent has not
yet been determined. Whether this larger ESU merits protection under the ESA cannot be determined at this time. NMFS
will attempt to identify the larger ESU that contains the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations as part
of an ongoing status review of all coastal coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.
This status review is being conducted in response to a petition received July 21, 1993, to list five stocks of coho salmon
in Oregon and a petition received October 20, 1993, to list all coho salmon stocks in California, Oregon, Washington,
and Idaho.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a council-prepared amendment
to a fishery management plan be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval.
The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that
the amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment in determining
approvability of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 9 proposes to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Authorize the collection of historical red snapper landings data needed to evaluate red snapper effort management
alternatives and to identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management
regime; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Extend the current moratorium on reef fish permits and the red snapper endorsement system, including its associated
trip and landing limits, through December 31, 1995, unless replaced earlier by a red snapper effort management system.
Red snapper commercial landings data for 1990, 1991, and 1992 would be collected from vessel owners or from operators
of permitted vessels for which the permit was based on the earned income qualification of an operator. Data would also
be collected to identify ``historical captains'' in the red snapper fishery and to obtain information on their landings
of red snapper and their share arrangements with vessel owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Commission is proposing today to facilitate registration and reporting by foreign private issuers, by allowing
flexibility in the selection of the reporting currency used in filings with the Commission and by streamlining financial
statement reconciliation requirements for foreign private issuers with operations in countries with hyperinflationary
economies. As proposed, a foreign private issuer could state amounts in its financial statements in any currency
which it deemed appropriate so long as it reports to a majority of its nonaffiliated securityholders using that currency.
In addition, a foreign private issuer that accounts for its operations in hyperinflationary environments in accordance
with International Accounting Standard No. 21, ``The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates,'' as amended
in 1993 (``IAS 21''), would not need to reconcile the differences that would have resulted from application of the
U.S. standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, ``Foreign Currency Translation'' (``SFAS 52'').

II. Reporting Currency of Foreign Private Issuers

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of a Reporting Currency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Commission's rules require a foreign issuer to present its financial statements in the currency of
either its country of incorporation or of its primary economic environment. This requirement has been increasingly
troublesome for foreign companies entering the U.S. market, and the staff has received a number of requests for accommodation.
Some foreign issuers that have historically reported in their domestic market using the U.S. dollar seek to report
on that basis in the U.S., but current rules would not permit them to do so in filings with the Commission. In addition,
the issue of reporting currency is particularly troublesome for foreign private issuers that operate in several
countries or have securities traded in a number of markets. For such companies, the country of incorporation may be
a matter of convenience or may account only for a limited part of its business activity; no single economic environment
may be dominant to its operations or shareholder base. In these circumstances, management may wish to select a reporting
currency chiefly on the basis of its familiarity to and acceptance by the international markets. Some multinational
companies state amounts in their financial statements in different currencies in different trading markets, either
by choice or by mandate of the various jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these difficulties, the Commission is proposing to revise Rule 3&hyph;20 of Regulation S&hyph;X to permit
a foreign issuer to state the amounts in its primary financial statements using any currency in which it reports to
a majority of its nonaffiliated securityholders.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendment would require specific disclosure in a note to the financial statements if the currency in which the
issuer expects to declare any dividends is different from the reporting currency, or there are material exchange
restrictions affecting the reporting currency or the currency in which dividends are paid. The rule as proposed to
be amended would not limit a foreign issuer's choice of reporting currency. Management should be in the best position
to determine which reporting currency is most relevant to the issuer's investors, taking into consideration the
effects of that choice on the measurement of operations in the hyperinflationary environments in which the issuer
does business.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An issuer could furnish to some or all of its securityholders financial statements with amounts in currencies other
than the one selected as its reporting currency for purposes of filings with the Commission so long as it also delivered
to a majority of its unaffiliated securityholders financial statements with amounts stated in the reporting currency
used in its Commission filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that the choice of reporting currency can affect trends in sales, net income, working capital,
and similar items depicted in the financial statements. Also, depending on the reporting currency, measurement
differences arise if the issuer has material operations in a hyperinflationary environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such consequences of the reporting currency selection arise for domestic and foreign companies alike, particularly
if they have substantive operations in more than one country. To the extent that depicted trends and reported results
are affected by exchange rate fluctuations, explanatory disclosure should be provided in filings with the Commission
as part of the explanation of the material changes from year to year required in management's discussion and analysis.

SFAS 52 requires that the underlying transactions of operations in hyperinflationary environments be measured
in the reporting currency, which may differ from company to company, rather than in the currency of the operation's
primary economic environment. Differences may also arise because some issuers, which prepare their primary financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles of other jurisdictions, measure transactions using the functional
currency of that business, with the results restated for changes in price-level and then translated to the reporting
currency. An accommodation to issuers that account for operations in hyperinflationary environments using a method
that differs from that required by U.S. GAAP is discussed in a later section of this release.

 At that time, the Commission noted the need for registrants to provide more information about the material functional
currencies of foreign operations, and observed that disaggregated disclosure about particular operations may
be necessary in some circumstances. Also, in response to the requirements of Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K (``Management's
Discussion and Analysis'') of Regulation S&hyph;K,

Comment is requested on the need for accommodation with respect to reporting currency, and whether the proposed revisions
adequately address these needs. Comment is also requested as to whether the financial statements, taken together
with the disclosures described above, will provide investors with adequate and meaningful information. What additional
quantitative or other disclosures may be necessary to fully inform investors regarding operations and transactions
conducted in currencies other than the reporting currency? Comment is also requested as to whether the rule should
be amended to allow only the additional latitude of use of the currency of the country in which a majority of the issuer's
shareholders reside, or simply to allow the additional alternative of reporting in U.S. dollars even if it is not the
issuer's primary economic environment. Are there circumstances in which the reporting currency should be limited
to the currency of the issuer's country of incorporation, or whether the selection of a reporting currency should
be affected by (a) the existence of hyperinflation in a predominant or significant currency used by the issuer, (b)
a high proportion of operating cash flows denominated in a single currency, (c) exchange restrictions on the reporting
currency or underlying currencies, or (d) other factors? Commenters recommending restriction of an issuer's choice
of reporting currency should indicate the appropriate criteria or other measures that would identify situations
warranting restriction of the reporting currency. Comment is also requested regarding whether the issuer should
be required to furnish financial statements in the selected reporting currency to all unaffiliated shareholders,
rather than to only a majority; whether the issuer should not be permitted to select a reporting currency for purposes
of filings with the Commission which differs from that used in reports distributed to investors in other major trading
markets; and whether a requirement limiting the issuer to a single currency in all distributions of its primary financial
statements would be desirable or feasible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Increased flexibility in the selection of a reporting currency may raise significant issues with respect to how the
foreign private issuer's underlying transactions should be measured. The Commission invites comment on two measurement
approaches, which are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Approach A, the issuer would measure separately its own transactions, and those of each of its material operations
(for example, branch, division, subsidiary, or joint venture) that is included in the issuer's consolidated financial
statements and located in a non-hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the primary economic
environment in which the issuer or the operation conducts its business.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Financial statement amounts so determined would be translated to the reporting currency using the methodology that
is prescribed by SFAS 52 for translation of financial statements from a functional currency to a reporting currency.
Under that method, (a) all balance sheet amounts are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at
the balance sheet date, (b) all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated at the exchange rate existing
at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period or year,
and (c) all the translation effects of exchange rate changes are included as a separate component (``cumulative translation
adjustment'') of shareholders' equity.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An issuer with a material operation in a hyperinflationary environment would measure the transactions of the operation
in the reporting currency pursuant to SFAS 52, except that no reconciliation to that method would be required in some
circumstances if the proposal relating to issuers with operations in hyperinflationary environments, discussed
in Section III of this release, is adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Approach B, all transactions of the issuer and its subsidiaries would be measured (or remeasured if not so measured
initially) using the reporting currency, except that transactions of each of its material foreign operations (for
example, branch, division, subsidiary, or joint venture) included in the consolidated financial statements and
located in a non-hyperinflationary environment would be measured using the particular currency of the primary economic
environment in which the foreign operation conducts its business. Financial statement amounts determined for the
material foreign operations of the issuer would be translated using the methodology prescribed by SFAS 52 for translation
of financial statements from a functional currency to a reporting currency, as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under both approaches, the effects of exchange rate changes between transaction date and settlement date of transactions
denominated in a currency other than the currency of measurement would be included in income. Monetary assets and
liabilities of the issuer and its operations that are not denominated in the currency of measurement would be translated
at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date with the effects of exchange rate changes included in income.

Neither approach A nor B affects accounting for foreign currency transactions as defined in SFAS 52. The Commission
is not proposing to revise, and is not considering revision of the requirements with respect to, accounting for foreign
currency transactions under SFAS 52. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Approach A, the reporting currency is treated as a currency of display, with no currency exchange gains or losses
recognized in income solely as a result of the selection of a particular reporting currency. A hypothetical issuer
with operations in each of three (non-hyperinflationary) countries would depict the same relationships (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
return on assets or equity, debt to equity ratio, gross profit margin, turnover ratios) in its annual financial statements,
regardless of where its parent company is domiciled or which reporting currency that it selects. Determinations
of ``lower of cost or market'' and ``net realizable value'' which are necessary under GAAP with respect to assets of
the issuer and its component operations will be made in the currency of that operation's primary economic environment.

Under Approach B, the effects of changing exchange rates between the reporting currency and any other currency in
which monetary assets and liabilities of the issuer's parent company and of its similarly domiciled subsidiaries
are denominated would be reflected as a component of income (``transaction gain or loss''). Determinations of ``lower
of cost or market'' and ``net realizable value'' which are necessary under GAAP with respect to assets of the issuer's
parent company and similarly domiciled subsidiaries will be made in the reporting currency, while these determinations
with respect to foreign operations will be made in the currency of that operation's primary economic environment.
A hypothetical issuer with operations in each of three countries could depict different financial statement relationships
(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
return on assets or equity, debt to equity ratio, gross profit margin, turnover ratios), depending on both factors_the
country in which its parent company is domiciled and the reporting currency that it selects, unless the issuer has
an immaterial amount of nonmonetary assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested as to which approach would better meet the needs of issuers and investors. Commenters should
indicate whether one approach or the other should be mandated or prohibited under particular circumstances; and
whether particular disclosures, in addition to an explanation of the accounting policy followed, should be required.
Commenters should consider whether an issuer that distributes financial statements stated in more than one currency
in different markets, either by election or mandate of particular jurisdictions, should be required to use one method
or the other in those financial statements; or whether additional disclosures should be required. Commenters should
consider whether additional guidance concerning translation to the selected reporting currency is necessary.

B. Changes of Reporting Currency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to Rule 3&hyph;20 also codify staff practice regarding changes in reporting currency. The
staff has addressed situations in which an issuer proposes to change its reporting currency because of a change of
its place of incorporation or of its primary economic environment, as well as when characteristics of its shareholder
base have changed. The proposed revisions specify that the financial statements for all periods presented should
be stated in the same reporting currency. In the event that an issuer elects to change its reporting currency, the proposed
revisions require that the financial statements of periods prior to the change be comprehensively recast as if the
new reporting currency had been used since at least the earliest period presented in the filing.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Under this method, the income statement and statement of cash flows would be translated into the new reporting currency
using an appropriately weighted average exchange rate for the applicable period, and the balance sheet would be translated
using the exchange rate at the end of the applicable period. Comprehensive translation into a single reporting currency
for all periods presented appears necessary to depict trends consistently and maintain other relationships within
the financial statements.

A change in the reporting currency may or may not be coincident with a change in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the operations exist. The U.S. accounting guidance applicable to a change in an entity's functional
currency appears in paragraph 9 of SFAS 52. The effects of differences between the method of accounting in the primary
financial statements for a change in functional currency and the method of accounting prescribed by U.S. GAAP should
be explained and quantified where reconciliation is required pursuant to Item 17 or Item 18 of Form 20&hyph;F.

At least one other jurisdiction permits issuers to recalculate the prior years' data by means of a ``convenience translation''
of the former reporting currency to the new currency using the exchange rate prevailing when the change of reporting
currency is implemented. See Emerging Issues Committee of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, Issue
No. 11 (December 15, 1989), ``Changes in Reporting Currency''.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested as to whether the financial statements should be recast for all periods, rather than only for
all periods presented, in order to allocate more exactly the effect of the change in reporting currency between retained
earnings and the cumulative translation adjustment. Comment is also requested as to whether other methods of adjusting
prior periods should be acceptable alternatives when a change in reporting currency is adopted. Commenters are asked
to address whether the selection of either Approach A or Approach B described above with respect to measurement of
the issuer's underlying transactions should affect the presentation of periods prior to a change in reporting currency.
Comment is also requested if the proposed rule should require disclosure of the reason why the issuer changed its reporting
currency.

III. Foreign Issuer Operations in a Hyperinflationary Economy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A foreign issuer that has material operations in a currency of a country with a hyperinflationary economy must, for
purposes of reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, measure those operations in the issuer's reporting currency.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 However, the accounting principles of most other countries require or permit the foreign issuer to measure operations
in hyperinflationary environments in the local currency, restated for the effects of changing prices, and then translated
to the reporting currency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
SFAS 52 governs the accounting for operations in hyperinflationary environments. Paragraph 11 of that standard
defines a hyperinflationary environment as ``one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or
more over a 3-year period.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because devaluation of a currency is usually not equivalent to the effect of inflation on that currency's purchasing
power, the remeasurement process required by U.S. GAAP will not produce the same results as the restate-translate
method often followed by foreign issuers. The staff has addressed a number of requests by foreign issuers for accommodation
with respect to the requirement to quantify effects of differences between the methods of accounting for hyperinflationary
operations. Foreign issuers cite the cost and complexity involved in such a reconciliation, as it effectively may
require duplicate recordkeeping in both the reporting currency and the local currency of the operation. Foreign
issuers have observed that amounts which would be produced by application of SFAS 52 will, nevertheless, not be comparable
to an identically situated U.S. company if the reporting currency of the foreign issuer is not U.S. dollars.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
SFAS 52 would require measurement of the operation's transactions in the foreign issuer's reporting currency, while
the U.S. company would measure the operation's transactions in U.S dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address these concerns, the Commission is proposing to eliminate the requirement of Items 17 and 18 of Form 20&hyph;F
that an issuer quantify the effects on financial statements of its use of a translation methodology for operations
in a hyperinflationary environment which differs from SFAS 52 so long as it conforms with IAS 21, provided that the
method used is consistently applied in all periods. IAS 21, as amended in 1993, requires that amounts in the financial
statements of the hyperinflationary operation be restated for the effects of changing prices in accordance with
International Accounting Standard No. 29, ``Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' (``IAS 29''),
and then translated to the reporting currency.

Issuers may elect either of two methods described by IAS 29: (a) Restatement of historical cost amounts into units
of currency that have the same general purchasing power (historical cost/constant currency method), or (b) measurement
at current cost, with amounts for prior periods restated for changes in the general level of prices (current cost method).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested on the need for accommodation with respect to the accounting for hyperinflationary operations,
and whether the proposed revisions adequately address those needs. Comment is also requested as to whether financial
statements and accompanying reconciliation produced on the basis permitted by the proposal would provide investors
with adequate and meaningful information. Comment is requested regarding whether IAS 29 provides sufficient guidance
to ensure appropriate application of both the current cost method and the historical cost/constant currency method,
or whether only one or the other of the two methods should be permitted without reconciliation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A foreign private issuer, as defined in &sect;230.405 of this chapter, shall state amounts in its primary financial
statements in the currency in which it reports in its financial statements that are distributed to the majority of
its nonaffiliated shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The currency in which amounts in the financial statements are stated shall be disclosed prominently on the face
of the financial statements. If dividends on publicly-held equity securities will be declared in a currency other
than the reporting currency, a note to the financial statements shall identify that currency. If there are material
exchange restrictions or controls relating to the issuer's reporting currency, the currency of the issuer's domicile,
or the currency in which the issuer will pay dividends, prominent disclosure of this fact shall be made in the financial
statements. If the reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar, dollar-equivalent financial statements or convenience
translations shall not be presented, except a translation may be presented of the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent
interim period presented using the exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet included in the filing, except
that a rate as of the most recent practicable date shall be used if materially different. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the financial statements of a foreign private issuer are stated in a currency of a country that has experienced
cumulative inflationary effects exceeding a total of 100 percent over the most recent three year period, and have
not been recast or otherwise supplemented to include information on a historical cost/constant currency or current
cost basis prescribed or permitted by appropriate authoritative standards, the issuer shall present supplementary
information to quantify the effects of changing prices upon its financial position and results of operations.

(d) Either. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approach A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the currency selected for reporting purposes, the issuer shall measure separately its own transactions,
and those of each of its material operations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 branches, divisions, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and similar entities) that is included in the issuer's consolidated
financial statements and not located in a hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the primary
economic environment in which the issuer or the operation conducts its business. Balance sheet amounts so determined
shall be translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses,
gains, and losses shall be translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate,
a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period; and all translation effects of exchange rate changes shall
be included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') of shareholders' equity. For purposes
of this paragraph, the currency of an operation's primary economic environment is normally the currency in which
cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary environment is one that has cumulative inflation
of approximately 100% or more over the most recent three year period. Departures from the methodology presented in
this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to Items 17 and 18(c)(2) of Form 20&hyph;F (&sect;249.220f of this chapter).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approach B 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All transactions of the issuer and its subsidiaries shall be measured (or remeasured if not so measured initially)
using the reporting currency and the effects of exchange rate changes on monetary assets and liabilities of the issuer
and its subsidiaries shall be included in income, except that transactions of its material foreign operations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
branch, division, subsidiary, joint venture, or similar entity) included in the consolidated financial statements
and not located in a hyperinflationary environment shall be measured using the particular currency of the primary
economic environment in which the foreign operation conducts its business. With respect to financial statement
amounts of foreign operations so determined: Balance sheet amounts shall be translated into the reporting currency
at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses shall be translated at the
exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates
during the period; and all effects of exchange rate changes shall be included as a separate component (``cumulative
translation adjustment'') of shareholders' equity. For purposes of this paragraph, the currency of an operation's
primary economic environment is normally the currency in which cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary
environment is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over the most recent three year period.
Departures from the methodology presented in this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to Items 17 and 18(c)(2)
of Form 20&hyph;F (&sect;249.220f of this chapter). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The issuer shall state its primary financial statements in the same currency for all periods for which financial
information is presented. If the financial statements are stated in a currency that is different from that used in
financial statements previously filed with the Commission, the issuer shall recast its financial statements as
if the newly adopted currency had been used since at least the earliest period presented in the filing. The decision
to change the reporting currency shall be disclosed in a note to the financial statements in the period in which the
change occurs.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing for comment amendments to Regulation S&hyph;X,
which governs the form and content of financial statements and schedules furnished by public companies in filings
with the Commission. The proposed amendments would extend recently adopted accommodations for foreign issuers
to domestic issuers that are required to provide financial statements for significant foreign equity investees
or acquired foreign businesses. These accommodations address the age of financial statements, nature of reconciling
information and thresholds for providing such reconciliations. The proposed amendments also would eliminate certain
financial schedules that both domestic and foreign issuers are currently required to include in annual reports and
registration statements filed with the Commission.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing several amendments to the requirements governing financial statements of domestic
companies required to report financial statements of significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign equity
investees. These amendments would extend the same treatment for such foreign business acquisitions and investees
as has been recently adopted for foreign registrants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Similarly, the Commission is proposing to streamline required financial schedules to parallel revisions made to
the foreign issuer integrated disclosure system. An additional two schedules are proposed to be eliminated for both
domestic and foreign registrants.

The initiatives proposed today continue the ongoing efforts of the Commission to simplify and lower the cost of registration
and reporting by public companies in a manner that is consistent with investor protection.

II. Financial Statements of Significant Foreign Businesses Acquisitions and Foreign Equity Investees of Domestic
Companies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Domestic and foreign registrants alike are required to furnish audited financial statements of significant businesses
that have been acquired or are likely to be acquired.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Audited financial statements are required if the acquired business is significant at a level of 10 percent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 using tests based on the size of the registrant's investment in the business, the total assets of the business, and
the business' pre-tax income relative to amounts reported in the registrant's most recent financial statements.
Subject to the same tests of significance, separate audited financial statements of less than majority owned investees
(``equity investees'') are required for each year that those entities exceed the significance level of 20 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals made today with respect to these separate financial statements are based on the recognition that U.S.
companies may have the same difficulties in, and costs, of obtaining reconciled financial statements for foreign
acquisitions and foreign investments as foreign issuers for whom the Commission adopted revisions to the requirements
today.

A. Significant Threshold for Equity Investees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to modify one of the three tests for significance made pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation
S&hyph;X to determine whether financial statements of an equity investee, foreign or domestic, must be provided.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that, for purposes of this rule, the significance of an investee should be based on a comparison
of the registrant's proportionate share of the investee's pre-tax income to that of the registrant and of the registrant's
investment in the investee relative to the registrant's total assets. Comparison of the investee's total assets
to the total assets of the registrant, as presently required, appears insufficiently relevant if the investee is
less than majority owned and, therefore, its financial statements are not consolidated in the registrant's financial
statements. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X to eliminate the

B. Reconciliation of Financial Statements of Significant Foreign Equity Investees and Foreign Acquirees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Financial statements of significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign equity investees are required to
be either presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') basis or reconciled to U.S. GAAP.
In the case of U.S. registrants, these financial statements are required to include all financial information required
by U.S. GAAP and Regulation S&hyph;X, such as segments and pension information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing to allow domestic registrants that are required to report financial statements of significant
foreign business acquisitions or foreign equity investees the same ability as has been provided foreign registrants
to provide such financials on a basis that complies with Item 17 of Form 20&hyph;F which does not require the disclosures
prescribed by U.S. GAAP and Regulation S&hyph;X. Likewise, the proposed rules would incorporate the 30 percent threshold
for providing such reconciling information as has been introduced for foreign registrants.

See Securities Act Release No. 7053 (April 19, 1994). Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP would continue to be required for
pro forma financial information depicting the effects of a registrant's acquisition of a foreign business. In circumstances
where a registrant furnishes separate financial statements of an equity investee pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation
S&hyph;X, the staff has not required the registrant to also furnish summarized financial data of the investee pursuant
to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) of Regulation S&hyph;X (17 CFR 210.4&hyph;08(g)) (

The relief provided under the proposed amendment would be available with respect to financial statements furnished

 is not organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, and either (a) more than 50 percent of its assets
are located outside the United States or (b) the majority of its executive officers and directors are not United States
citizens or residents. This standard includes tests which are similar to those used in the definition of foreign private
issuer in Regulation C.

III. Streamlining of Required Financial Statement Schedules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, domestic commercial and industrial issuers are required to file 14 financial schedules with their annual
reports and registration statements. Six of these schedules have been eliminated for foreign private issuers, specifically:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rule 12&hyph;02_Marketable Securities_Other Investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rule 12&hyph;03_Amounts Receivable from Related Parties and Underwriters, Promoters and Employees Other Than
Related Parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rule 12&hyph;05_Indebtedness of and to Related Parties_Not Current. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Rule 12&hyph;06_Property, Plant and Equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Rule 12&hyph;07_Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Property, Plant and Equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 12&hyph;08_Guarantees of Securities of Other Issuers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing to eliminate these schedules for domestic issuers as well. In addition, the Commission
is proposing to eliminate two additional schedules for both foreign and domestic issuers, namely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rule 12&hyph;10_Short-term Borrowings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rule 12&hyph;11_Supplementary Income Statement Information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposals, as discussed under marketable securities below, would also eliminate Schedule XIII_Other Investments
for commercial and industrial companies that is currently required for investments that are not included on the schedule
required by Rule 12&hyph;02 of Regulation S-X.

With respect to the securities of each issuer which have an aggregate market value exceeding 2% of the registrant's
total assets, the schedule must include a description of the issuer and of each security along with its cost, market
value, and carrying amount in the balance sheet. Securities that do not exceed 2% of assets may be grouped by political
subdivision for governmental securities and by industry type and similarity of risks for corporate securities.

Much of the information contained in these two schedules also is required to be furnished today in notes to the financial
statements pursuant to GAAP. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities'' (``SFAS 115''), issued in May 1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB''),
expanded the disclosure requirements for all debt securities and for equity securities that have a readily determinable
fair value. These securities must be classified into three categories: held to maturity (as to debt securities),
available for sale, and trading account. With respect to securities classified as held to maturity and available
for sale, SFAS 115 requires separate disclosure, grouped by major security type, of the fair value, gross unrealized
holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses, and amortized cost basis, as well as maturity and other relevant
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other pertinent disclosure requirements were established in March 1990 upon the FASB's issuance of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 105, ``Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet
Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk,'' (``SFAS 105''). SFAS 105 requires disclosure
of all significant concentrations of credit risk arising from an individual counterparty or groups of counterparties
that would be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, although SFAS 105 does not establish
a quantitative guideline for the determination of a significant concentration. In addition, disclosures required
by Item 303 of Regulation S-K

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

At the time that rules mandating these two schedules were adopted, the Commission indicated that the schedules codified
for reporting purposes the auditing concepts of Statement of Auditing Standards No. 6, ``Related Party Transactions''
(``SAS 6'') issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''). The Commission stated
further that if comprehensive GAAP requirements for related party disclosures were developed by the FASB in the future,
the need for the schedule would be reconsidered.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subsequently, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 57, ``Related Party Transactions''
(``SFAS 57''). As discussed in the background information to that standard, the FASB applied the guidance in SAS 6
in determining the disclosure requirements of SFAS 57, with the intent to extend the reporting principles codified
in Regulation S&hyph;X to companies that were not subject to the requirements of the Commission. SFAS 57 requires
material related party transactions to be disclosed in the financial statements, accompanied by such other information
as deemed necessary for an understanding of their effects on the financial statements. Unlike the schedules, SFAS
57 does not set quantitative thresholds of materiality at which a particular transaction or amount must be disclosed.

The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement for the schedules of related party amounts. Regulation S&hyph;K,
Item 404 ``Certain Relationships and Related Transactions''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 requires that material related party transactions be identified in the financial statements, with the amounts stated
on the face of the balance sheet, income statement, or statement of cash flows. The Commission believes these requirements,
in combination with the requirements of SFAS 57, should provide investors the necessary information about related
party transactions.

Some of the information that is included in these schedules is required to be included in financial statements pursuant
to generally accepted accounting principles. Balances by major classification are required by Accounting Principle
Board Opinion No. 12, (``Omnibus Opinion - 1967''). Information regarding total additions to property, plant and
equipment can be determined from the statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 95, ``Statement of Cash Flows'' (``SFAS 95''). While some analysts may use the more disaggregated data
that includes retirements, transfers, currency exchange rate effects, and similar activity in the separate accounts,
the data does not appear to be sufficiently useful to justify the cost incurred by many registrants in gathering this
data and having it audited. Accordingly, the proposed rules would eliminate the requirement to furnish these schedules.

Subsequent to the Commission's adoption of rules mandating this schedule, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, ``Accounting for Contingencies,'' (``SFAS 5'') which requires the disclosure of guarantees
of indebtedness of others. A separate schedule should be unnecessary for issuers complying with SFAS 5. Under SFAS
5 disclosure should include a description of the issuer and class of securities guaranteed, the total amount guaranteed
and outstanding, the nature of the guarantee, and any defaults by the issuer of the securities guaranteed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested regarding whether it is necessary or appropriate for the Commission to specify by rule the particular
disclosures related to guaranteed securities that must be furnished, and, if so, what items of disclosure would be

B. Additional Schedules Proposed To Be Eliminated for both Foreign and Domestic Issuers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Short Term Borrowings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Registrants, other than bank holding companies,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are required to furnish a schedule of short-term borrowings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The schedule discloses the maximum outstanding during the year, average outstanding during the year, and weighted
average interest rate during the period. Issuers have reported that the preparation of this information can be costly
and burdensome for many registrants. For example, registrants with decentralized management of short-term borrowings
incur significant cost to accumulate and obtain an audit of the maximum borrowing amount outstanding during a fiscal
year. Furthermore, some registrants have indicated that the only practicable manner to determine the weighted average
interest rate for the year is to base the calculation on borrowings outstanding at each month-end, but this measure
may be of little value and potentially confusing in some circumstances. Also, differing currency exchange rates
and rates of inflation may reduce the usefulness of the mathematical sums and weighted averages necessary for this
schedule.

Accordingly, the proposed rules would eliminate the requirement for the schedule and require instead financial
statement disclosure of the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of each of the dates for which
balance sheets are presented. This calculation, already currently furnished by many companies should reduce the
cost of compliance and still provide relevant information concerning the registrant's historical and near-term
cost of capital. Disclosure of interest rates embedded in balance sheet date borrowing, as proposed to be required,
accompanied by the disclosures concerning the registrant's liquidity and capital resources that are required in
the MD&amp;A would appear to be sufficiently informational to permit elimination of the short term borrowing schedule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to eliminate the requirement for the &sect;210.12&hyph;10 schedule and the proposed new requirement
for average interest rates as of the balance sheet date does not extend to investment companies. Because investment
companies' liquidity needs are different from those of other registrants, borrowings for such purposes as redemptions
and investments may change over a much shorter period. The Commission proposes to amend Regulation S&hyph;X by eliminating
the &sect;210.12&hyph;10 schedule of short term borrowings from &sect;210.6&hyph;10 and adding a requirement
to &sect;210.6&hyph;07.3. Although required outside the financial statements for certain registrants, the Commission
believes disclosure, in footnotes or elsewhere in the financial statements, of the average debt outstanding and
the weighted average interest rate for all borrowings during the period is appropriate.

2. Supplementary Income Statement Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial and industrial companies are required to furnish a schedule of supplementary income statement information,
if specified income statement items exceed 1% of revenues.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

As a result of the AICPA's issuance of a Statement of Position 93&hyph;7,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 disclosure of the amount of total advertising costs expensed in each period is now a generally accepted requirement
for purposes of annual financial statements. Although other income statement items referenced by this schedule
may not be disclosed on an ongoing basis by registrants, discussion of discretionary expenses and other items, quantified
to the extent practicable, may be necessary in the company's MD&amp;A in order to explain material trends and uncertainties
that affected operating results, liquidity or financial condition of the registrant, or which may be reasonably
likely to affect future results, liquidity or financial condition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
51
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Given that the MD&amp;A requirements applicable to both domestic and foreign issuers should result in disclosure
of material aspects of the items that would be reported in the schedule, the proposed rules no longer require the income
statement item schedule. For example, a reduced level of maintenance expenditures in the current period as compared
to the prior period should be discussed if it materially affected trends depicted in the financial statements or is
reasonably likely to have an effect on operations, expenditures or trends therein in future periods.

VI. Summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA''), pursuant to the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regarding the proposed rules. The IRFA notes that the proposed amendments are intended to provide issuers greater
flexibility and efficiency in accessing the public securities markets. The proposed amendments would not impose
any new reporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements on any entities. No alternatives to the proposed amendments
consistent with their objectives and the Commission's statutory mandate were found.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is expected that the overall effect of the proposed rules will provide issuers greater flexibility and increased
efficiency in raising capital from the public securities markets. The proposals to eliminate certain financial
schedules and to streamline financial statement requirements relating to significant foreign business acquisitions
and foreign equity investees could apply to any domestic issuer, including small entities registering or offering
securities for public sale. To the extent that these proposals have an effect on small entities, it is believed that
the proposals would reduce the compliance burdens associated with Securities Act or Exchange Act registration for
such entities, as they would for any other issuer. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from Wayne Carnall, Division of
Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street NW., Mail Stop 3&hyph;13, Washington,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing today to amend Form 20&hyph;F to streamline the financial statement reconciliation
requirements for foreign private issuers that have entered into business combinations. The proposed amendments
would eliminate the requirement to reconcile certain differences attributable to the determination of the method
of accounting for a business combination, and the amortization period of goodwill and negative goodwill, provided
the financial statements comply with International Accounting Standards No. 22 ``Business Combinations'' as amended,
regarding these items.

I. Method of Accounting for Business Combinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting principles in most countries prescribe two basic methods of accounting for business combinations. One
method, called ``pooling of interests'' under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') and ``uniting
of interests'' under International Accounting Standard No. 22, ``Business Combinations'', as amended in 1993 (``IAS
22''), provides generally for the retroactive restatement of financial statements at the combined historical costs
of the merging companies. The other method, called ``purchase'' under U.S. GAAP and ``acquisition'' under IAS 22,
provides generally for recognition of the acquired company's assets and liabilities at their fair value at the acquisition
date. Under U.S. GAAP, as well as under IAS 22, the methods are not alternatives; rather, the selection of the method
is based on specific criteria as they apply to the particular facts and circumstances. However, U.S. GAAP, IAS 22,
and the accounting standards of most countries all employ different criteria for determining which of the two methods
is applicable to a transaction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depending on which of the two basic methods is used to account for a business combination, substantial differences
in financial statements result. A business combination may be appropriately accounted for in the foreign issuer's
primary financial statements by retroactive restatement at combined historical cost using accounting standards
of the foreign jurisdiction, whereas, the same transaction would be accounted for as a purchase (fair value recognition
at acquisition date) under U.S. GAAP. There currently is a requirement to quantify the effects on the financial statements
of these two different methods of accounting for a business combination. This requirement has resulted in significant
additional recordkeeping requirements, as well as complex and voluminous reconciling disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement that foreign private issuers quantify the effects of differences
arising solely from the different criteria applied to the selection of the basic method of accounting for a business
combination if the criteria used in the primary financial statements for determining the method are consistently
applied and are consistent with IAS 22. However, the effects of differences in the procedures used to implement either
the purchase or pooling of interests methods of accounting would continue to be quantified under the proposed amendment.
For example, in applying the purchase method, if the amounts included in the primary financial statements did not
assign the same fair value to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as would be determined in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, the difference would need to be addressed in the reconciliation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, a business combination which would be deemed a uniting of interests under IAS 22 and which
was accounted for using that basic method in the primary financial statements may be deemed to be, for purposes of the
reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a pooling of interests, with quantification required only to the extent that the procedures
used in the primary financial statements differ from the procedures required under U.S. GAAP for a pooling of interests.
Similarly, a business combination which would be deemed an acquisition under IAS 22 and which was accounted for using
that basic method in the primary financial statements may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP, a purchase, with quantification required only to the extent that the procedures used in the primary financial
statements differ from the procedures required under U.S. GAAP for a purchase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would not reduce the quality or comparability of financial information furnished to investors to a material
extent, while the cost and burden of a foreign issuer's filing with the Commission would be substantially reduced.
The Commission believes the IAS criteria to be well defined, reasonable, and sufficiently clear to ensure consistent
application. It is expected that nearly all combinations that would be accounted for as purchases under U.S. GAAP
would be deemed acquisitions under IAS 22. Some combinations that could qualify as pooling of interests under U.S.
GAAP, however, will be deemed acquisitions under IAS 22, and some of the extremely few transactions that will qualify
as uniting of interest under IAS 22 may be deemed purchases under U.S. GAAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested as to whether foreign private issuers should continue to quantify differences arising solely
from differences in the criteria used to select the method of accounting for business combinations; whether certain
forms or types of combinations (e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 promoter transactions, leveraged buy-outs) should be excluded from the relief afforded by the proposed rule, and,
if so, which ones; and whether consistency in application in the primary financial statements of the criteria for
determination of the method of accounting should be, as is proposed, a condition of the relief granted under the rule.
Comment also is requested regarding the need to quantify effects of differences in the procedures followed under
the two basic methods of accounting.

II. Accounting for Goodwill and Negative Goodwill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a business combination accounted for as a purchase or acquisition, the excess of the cost of the acquired company
over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, reduced by the fair value of the liabilities
assumed, is deemed ``goodwill.'' If the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the cost, ``negative goodwill''
arises. Goodwill and negative goodwill are accounted for differently under U.S. GAAP and IAS 22. Under U.S. GAAP,
goodwill or negative goodwill must be amortized over its useful life except that the amortization period may not exceed
forty years. Under IAS 22, goodwill or negative goodwill must be amortized over a period not exceeding five years,
unless a longer period, not exceeding twenty years, can be justified. The effects of the differences in amortization
periods should be sufficiently transparent that investors would be able to understand and compare financial results
and condition company to company, and the acceptance of the amortization period in IAS 22 will ease the burden for foreign
private issuers filing with the Commission. Accordingly, under the proposals, foreign private issuers that have
consistently applied accounting policies which amortize goodwill and negative goodwill over periods which comply
with the amended guidance in IAS 22, but which differ from the periods that would be permitted under U.S. GAAP, would
not be required to quantify the effects of that difference in the reconciliation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the amount of goodwill and negative goodwill that is subject to amortization for purposes of the reconciliation
to U.S. GAAP, foreign private issuers would continue to be required to consider all other provisions of purchase accounting
under U.S. GAAP. Issuers that write-off goodwill or negative goodwill directly to equity would need to record goodwill
and the related amortization expense in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested regarding the appropriateness of accepting the provisions of IAS 22 with respect to the amortization
period of goodwill and negative goodwill. Comment also is requested as to whether additional disclosures should
be required, such as the useful life determined in accordance with US GAAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Transitional Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IAS 22, as amended in 1993 becomes operative for financial statements covering periods beginning on or after January
1, 1995 with retroactive application encouraged but not required. The Commission believes that conformance with
IAS 22, or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, is necessary for all periods to provide investors with adequate information.
The accounting should be consistently applied with respect to all business combinations that would affect reported
income in the periods presented in the filing if accounted for in accordance with IAS 22. Accordingly, the relief provided
by the rule with respect to the determination of the method of accounting for business combinations and the amortization
period for goodwill and negative goodwill is proposed to be available only if the method in the primary financial statements
has been consistently applied and is consistent with the amended guidance in IAS 22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested on the appropriateness of requiring issuers to conform with the amended guidance in IAS 22 for
all periods to receive relief from the reconciliation requirement.

As authorized by title V of the Older Americans Act (OAA or Act), as amended (42 U.S.C. 3056, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) fosters and promotes useful part-time opportunities
in community service activities for persons with low incomes who are fifty-five years old or older. The Employment
and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) administers the program by means
of grant agreements with eligible organizations such as governmental entities and certain public and private non-profit
agencies and organizations. Pursuant to the Act, the Department in 1973 established SCSEP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SCSEP regulations were last revised in 1976: 29 CFR part 89, 41 FR 9006 (March 2, 1976). The SCSEP legislation has
been amended by the following laws since the last revision of the regulation: Public Law 95&hyph;478, section 105
(October 18, 1978); Public Law 97&hyph;115, section 12 (December 29, 1981); Pub. L. 98&hyph;459, sections 501&hyph;05
(October 9, 1984); Public Law 100&hyph;175, sections 161&hyph;66 (December 7, 1987); and Public Law 102&hyph;375,
sections 502&hyph;11 (September 30, 1992) and Public Law 103&hyph;171 (December 2, 1993). On July 19, 1985, the Department
published a notice of proposed rulemaking governing the SCSEP in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 29606) for the purpose of soliciting public comment. The proposed rule would have implemented only the amendments
established by Pub. L. 98&hyph;459 (October 9, 1984). The comments made in response to the July 19, 1985, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed rule have been considered in drafting this proposed rule. Also implemented are the 1987 and 1992 amendments
contained in Public Law 100&hyph;175 (December 7, 1987), and Pub. L. 102&hyph;375 (September 30, 1992). The Department
has made other minor changes to accommodate revisions in other federal regulations which impact upon the operations
of SCSEP. For that reason, the Department is providing an opportunity for public comment on the entire regulation.
Since 1985, pursuant to grant agreements, recipients and subrecipients have used the July 19, 1985, proposed rule
to administer and operate their projects. During that period, no substantive problems with the July 19, 1985, proposed
rule have been identified. Therefore, major changes have not been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document proposes to revise the proposed SCSEP regulation to conform to the OAA and to make technical changes
based on the Department's experience in administering the SCSEP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unavailability of transportation. This provision does not institute an untried procedure. Instead, it sanctions

unsubsidized employment so other eligible applicants would have an opportunity to participate in the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Prior Amendments and Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a discussion of proposed changes made as a result of public comments on the July 19, 1985, proposed
regulation, which was never finalized; changes made to the OAA by the 1987 amendments (Pub. L. 199&hyph;175); and
other editorial, clarification and technical purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) under title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, which maintains a dual
objective of providing community service assignments while promoting transition to unsubsidized employment.
This part, and other pertinent regulations expressly incorporated by reference, set forth all regulations applicable
to the SCSEP.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 641.102 removes or amends a number of definitions of terms to reflect DOL's uniform administrative requirements
for grants in 29 CFR part 97, which apply to activities under this part. Among the terms omitted are ``local government'',
``State'', and ``grant agreement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 641.102 is amended to expand its coverage consistent with the 1987 amendments (Pub. L. 100&hyph;175),
to include ``literacy tutoring'' among the examples of community services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 641.302(a) conforms to the revision of OAA section 502(b)(1)(M), made by section 162(a) of Pub. L. 100&hyph;175.
The program assurance in that section now must take into account the rates of poverty and unemployment of the eligible
individual groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section 641.303 is amended by removing the words ``Objective of'' from the beginning of paragraph (b) and adding

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 641.312 is amended to add a new paragraph (b)(4). The former paragraph (b)(4) is redesignated as paragraph

to read: ``When authorized in the grant agreement, transportation may be provided for enrollees from home to work,
to training or to supportive services.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Section 641.315 is revised to read: ``A maximum duration of enrollment may be established by the recipient in the
grant agreement when authorized by the Department.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Section 641.324 is amended by revising the heading of the section to read: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Enrollee and applicant complaint resolution.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In paragraph (b), the word ``federal'' is added before the word ``law'' in the first sentence. Paragraph (c) is revised
to read: ``Recipients that do not receive any funds under the JTPA shall process complaints of discrimination in accordance
with Title 29 CFR parts 31 and 32. Recipients that receive any funds under JTPA shall process complaints of discrimination
in accordance with Title 29 CFR part 34.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Section 641.402(b)(2) is redesignated as &sect;641.405(b)(2) and is revised to read: ``The amount of Federal
funds budgeted for enrollee wages and fringe benefits shall be no less than 75 percent of the grant.'' The remainder
of that sentence is removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Section 641.405(b)(1) is revised to conform to the revisions of section 502(c)(3) of the OAA, made by section 161
of Pub. L. 100&hyph;175. The maximum percentage of federal funds which may be used for administrative costs is now
limited to 13.5 percent, unless the Department increases the amount available to not more than 15 percent of the grant's
federal cost. The Department shall administer such required increases in accordance with section 502(c)(3) of the
OAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Section 641.406 is expanded to include administrative cost waiver criteria.

This proposed rule is not classified as a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12866 concerning Federal regulations
because it is not likely to result in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase
in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic
regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,
or the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets. Accordingly, no regulatory
impact analysis is required.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recipient or subrecipient shall assess each enrollee under the grant or subgrant, respectively, to determine
the most suitable SCSEP assignment for the individual and to identify appropriate employment and training objectives.
The assessment shall be made in consultation with the new enrollee and should consider the individual's preference
of occupational category, work history, skills, interests, talents, physical capabilities, need for supportive
services, aptitudes, potential for performing proposed community service employment duties, and potential for
transition to unsubsidized employment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recipient and subrecipient shall use the assessment or reassessment as a basis for developing or amending an individual
development plan (IDP). The IDP shall be developed in partnership with the enrollee to reflect the needs of the enrollee
as indicated by the assessment, as well as the expressed interests and desires of the enrollee.

Review of IDP plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recipient and subrecipient shall review the IDP at least once a program year for the following purposes: to evaluate
the progress of each enrollee in meeting the objectives of the service strategy; to determine each enrollee's potential
for transition to unsubsidized employment; to determine the appropriateness of each enrollee's current community
service employment assignment; and to review progress made toward meeting their training and employment objectives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon completion of the review, the sponsor may develop an alternative assignment, when feasible, should there be
one of the following determinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That a different community service employment assignment will provide greater opportunity for the use of an enrollee's
skills and aptitudes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That an alternative assignment will provide work experience which will enhance the potential for unsubsidized
employment; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wages.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon engaging in part-time community service employment assignments, including orientation and training in preparation
for community service employment assignments, each enrollee shall receive wages at a rate no less than the highest
applicable rate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The minimum wage which would be applicable to the enrollee under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State or local minimum wage for the most nearly comparable covered employment; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The prevailing rates of pay for persons employed in similar public occupations by the same employer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fringe benefits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The recipient or subrecipient shall ensure that enrollees receive all fringe benefits required by law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within a project or subproject, fringe benefits shall be provided uniformly to all enrollees, unless the Department
agrees to waiver this provision due to a determination that such a waive is in the best interests of applicants, enrollees,
and the project administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physical assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A physical examination shall be regarded as a fringe benefit and its use will be limited to determining the need for
supportive services. A copy of the physical examination shall be provided to the enrollee. A physical examination
is a program benefit and shall not be interpreted as an eligibility criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Each individual selected for enrollment shall have a physical assessment within the 2-month period immediately
before the first day of compensated participation which shall be used as part of the assessment process following
eligibility determination. [Section 502(b)(1)(N).] Exceptions are provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Enrollees should be provided a physical examination every twelve months, but no enrollee may participate in
community service employment for more than 15 months without a physical examination or a waiver, as provided by paragraph
(b)(3)(iv) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An enrollee who is terminated may be reenrolled without an additional physical assessment, provided that the
time elapsed since the last physical assessment does not exceed 15 months, and provided that a schedule of one examination
within each 15-month period shall be resumed, based on the date of the last examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, when an individual objects to a physical
examination, the recipient or subrecipient shall obtain a signed waiver prior to the first day of compensated participation.
Thereafter, an additional signed waiver shall be obtained from each enrollee before providing any compensated participation
more than 15 months after the date of the enrollee's latest waiver. Failure to receive such waiver within the 15-month
timeframe will result in the enrollee's preclusion from further participation in an assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Expenditures of grant funds for contributions into a retirement system or plan are prohibited, unless the recipient
has documentation on hand showing that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs are allowable under the appropriate cost principles indicated at &sect;641.403(b); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Such contributions bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing such benefits to enrollees because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the benefits vest at the time contributions are made on behalf of the enrollees; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the charges to SCSEP funds are for contributions on behalf of enrollees to a ``defined benefit'' type of plan which
do not exceed the amounts reasonably necessary to provide the specified benefit to enrollees, as determined under
a separate actuarial determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Workers' compensation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where an enrollee is not covered by the State workers' compensation law, the recipient or subrecipient shall provide
the enrollee with workers' compensation benefits equal to that provided by law for covered employment. [Section
504(b).]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unemployment compensation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(a) The recipient or subrecipient shall provide supportive services designed to assist the enrollee in participating
successfully in community service employment assignments and, where appropriate, to prepare and assist the enrollee
in obtaining unsubsidized employment. To the extent feasible, the recipient or subrecipient shall utilize supportive
services available from other titles of the OAA, particularly those administered by area agencies on aging and other
funding sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The recipient or subrecipient shall provide a new enrollee with training related to community service employment
assignments prior to, and as preparation for, actual community service employment. Training may be provided through
lectures, seminars, classroom instruction, individual instruction or other arrangements, including but not limited
to arrangements with employment and training programs. The recipient or the subrecipient is encouraged to obtain
such services through locally available resources, including employment and training programs, as defined in &sect;641.103,
and through host agencies, at no cost or reduced cost to the project. [Section 502(b)(1)(I).]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Training shall consist of up to 480 hours and shall be consistent with the enrollee's IDP. Such training shall cover
all aspects of training,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In addition to training in preparation for community service employment assignments, as described in this section,
a recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to arrange for, or directly provide, skills-training opportunities beyond
the SCSEP community service training activities which will permit the enrollee to acquire or improve skills, including
literacy training, applicable in community service employment or for unsubsidized employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A recipient or subrecipient, to the extent feasible, shall arrange skill-training for the enrollee which is realistic
and consistent with his or her IDP. A recipient or subrecipient shall place major emphasis on the training available

Should attrition or funding adjustments prevent a portion of project funds from being fully utilized, the recipient
may use those funds during the period of the agreement to over-enroll additional eligible individuals. The number
over-enrolled may not exceed 20 percent of the total number of authorized positions established under the grant agreement
without the written approval of the Department. Payments to or on behalf of enrollees in such positions shall not exceed
the amount of the unused funds available. Each individual enrolled in such a position shall be informed in writing
that the assignment is of a short-term nature and may be terminated. The recipient shall first seek to maintain full
