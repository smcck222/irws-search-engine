SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 14, 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) published a proposed rule to amend the Federal
meat and poultry products inspection regulations to require appeals above the circuit supervisor level that are
related to disposition of retained meat and poultry product to be made in writing; provide that an establishment has
20 calendar days to appeal a retention, recondition or rework product, or properly dispose of the product; and establish
procedures to ensure appropriate disposition of product immediately after a decision has been reached on an appeal.
The proposal also would allow establishments to accumulate retained product for the purpose of reexamination with
specialized detecting equipment provided written procedures for such activity are approved by the Regional Director.

be processed and to revise the text thereof for clarity and consistency of usage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 15, 1994, the Department published a notice of proposed rule (59 FR 18010). Due to problems which occurred
in converting the draft document from one computer system to another, certain revisions to the document were not incorporated
into the version which was sent for publication. The Department is, therefore, withdrawing the the April 15, 1994
proposed rulemaking which revised 22 CFR 42.61(a) and is hereby publishing the revised proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22 CFR 42.61 is that portion of the Department's immigrant visa regulations which establishes rules for determining
at which consular office an alien shall make his or her immigrant visa application. Currently, the first sentence
of subsection (a) of &sect;42.61 specifies that ``in ordinary circumstances'' an alien's application shall be processed
and adjudicated by the consular office having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence. The second sentence
allows for an exception to this general rule in the case of an alien physically present in an area but not having a residence
therein, if the alien can establish that he or she will remain in the area long enough to permit the application to be
processed to a conclusion. The remainder of 22 CFR 42.61(a) allows for acceptance of immigrant visa applications
by other consular offices, either as a matter of discretion or at the direction of the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's view that the existing regulatory text affords the Department the authority to make exceptions
to the general rules concerning where an application for an immigrant visa shall be made for policy or operational
reasons, including reasons of foreign policy, as may be necessary. Recently, however, questions have been raised
whether such authority can properly be so imputed, given the phrasing of the text. Since these questions have been
raised, the Department believes it to be appropriate to amend the text to make this authority explicit. In addition,
the Department is taking the occasion to revise the text editorially for purposes of clarity and consistency of usage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that this regulatory change is both interpretive and concerned with management and matters
of foreign policy. The Department has nevertheless decided to provide for a thirty-day comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule would not impose information collection requirements
under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required under Executive
Order 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866,
but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alien to apply in consular district of residence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless otherwise directed by the Department, an alien applying for an immigrant visa shall make application at the
consular office having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence. Also, unless otherwise provided by the
Department, an alien physically present in an area but having no residence therein may make application at the consular
office having jurisdiction over that area if the alien can establish that he or she will be able to remain in the area
for the period required to process the application. Finally, a consular office may, as a matter of discretion, or shall,
at the direction of the Department, accept an immigrant visa application from an alien who is neither a resident of,
nor physically present in, the area designated for that office for such purpose. For the purposes of this section,
an alien physically present in the United States shall be considered to be a resident of the area of his or her last residence
prior to entry into the United States.

This proposed rule would replace the current method of per diem billings based on diagnostic related groups and expand
the single outpatient billing category to as many as forty to fifty, and expand the billing for outpatient services
to include land ambulance service, air ambulance service and hyperbaric services. This proposed rule improves billing
methods for both inpatient and outpatient care. This creates a greater level of specificity which more accurately
reflects the cost of the care provided. In addition, the proposed rule will identify additional outpatient services
for which recovery of costs will be sought.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. 1095 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99&hyph;272,
&sect;2001(a)(1), to permit the Department of Defense to collect from third party payers reasonable inpatient hospital
care costs incurred on behalf of most DoD health care beneficiaries. To implement this statute, the Department of
Defense issued a proposed rule October 8, 1986, and a final rule September 25, 1987. The final rule has been amended
several times since 1987, most recently on September 9, 1992 (57 FR 41096). That rule changed the unified per diem rate
for inpatient care to a set of 12 clinical group per diem rates. It also implemented authority to bill for outpatient
services by establishing a single per visit rate for most outpatient services.

II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Inpatient Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In October 1992, the Department of Defense began a transition from the traditional single rate for reimbursement
for various health care services to multiple rates reflective of the clinical care provided. The multiple rates result
in charges that more closely approximate the actual costs of delivering specific categories of medical services,
such as surgical care, obstetrical care, pediatric care, etc. The rates are based on the actual costs of rendering
healthcare services as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose a change to paragraph 220.8(c) to replace the current twelve billing categories with a billing method based
on diagnostic related groups (DRGs), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3). We believe the DRG-based
method for determining reasonable costs of inpatient care will produce more accurate and equitable billings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Billings will more accurately reflect the costs associated with the actual services provided. Our proposal is to
model our DRG-based cost methodology on the DRG-based payment system for hospital care under the Civilian Health
and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). However, in some respects, we propose simplification of
CHAMPUS methods, with authority to introduce the additional refinements at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, we propose initially to use a single national standardized amount, rather than the three standardized
amounts (large urban, other urban, and rural) used by CHAMPUS. The three amounts do not differ significantly and are
probably not as relevant in connection with a unified federal hospital system, such as DoD's. However, the proposed
rule would allow us to adapt the multiple standardized amounts at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standardized amount will be the result of dividing total system-wide costs of inpatient care by the total number
of discharges system-wide. With respect to DRG relative weights, we propose to use the same weights as are used for
the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method. The CHAMPUS weights were calculated from a data base of actual CHAMPUS claims
filed by civilian hospitals. Because the patient population under military treatment facilities and CHAMPUS are
quite similar, we believe it appropriate to use the same weights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method uses a number of adjustments to the product of standardized amount multiplied
by the relative weight of the DRG involved. The adjustments relate to outlier cases, area wage differences and indirect
medical education. We propose initially not to use these adjustments, but to allow all related costs to be reflected
in the standardized amount. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and predictability for payers. However,
the proposed rule would allow these adjustments to be introduced at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with current practice, the standard DRG-based rate shall be subdivided into three categories: Hospital
charges, Professional charges, and Ancillary charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intended effective date for implementation of a multiple rate schedule shall be October 1, 1994, the effective
date of this rule, barring unforeseen difficulties in automation support. The specific rates will be published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Outpatient Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with the inpatient rates, the outpatient rates will be based on the actual costs of rendering healthcare services
as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS). MEPRS is the standard expense reporting
system for all fixed medical treatment facilities (MTFs) within the Department of Defense (DoD) and is the accepted
source of healthcare information for Congress and offices and agencies of the Executive Branch. The reimbursement
categories will be selected based on board certified specialties/subspecialties widely accepted by graduate medical
accrediting organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American
Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rates may be established but need not be limited to each of the following clinical reimbursement categories: Internal
Medicine, Allergy, Cardiology, Diabetic, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Hypertension, Nephrology,
Neurology, Nutrition, Oncology, Pulmonary Disease, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Infectious Disease, Physical
Medicine, General Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Organ Transplant,
Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Procotology, Urology, Pediatric Surgery, Family Planning, Obstetrics, Gynecology,
Pediatrics, Adolocent Pediatrics, Well Baby, Orthopaedics, Cast, Orthotic Laboratory, Hand Surgery, Podiatry,
Psychiatry, Psychology, Child Guidance, Mental Health, Social Work, Substance Abuse Rehabilitation, Family Practice,
and Occupational and Physical Therapy. We will not necessarily establish a separate rate for each of these clinical
reimbursement categories. Similar categories may be combined for purposes of billing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another proposed revision to section 220.8 involves the expansion of a single outpatient rate to multiple reimbursement
category rates similar to that for inpatient care. The Department of Defense proposes to adopt a methodology for computing
rates for outpatient care similar to that used for computing multiple rates for inpatient care. Thus, collections
for most outpatient services will be based on a standard per visit fee to a specialty/subspecialty which is representative
of the average cost in facilities of the Uniformed Services of an outpatient visit to that specialty clinic. Multiple
outpatient visits on the same day to different clinics will result in one charge for each clinic visit. Multiple visits
on the same day to the same clinic will only have one charge. As a general rule, each standard per visit amount to the specialty/subspecialty
clinic will be all-inclusive. No additional charge will be made for routine laboratory, radiology, pharmacy or other
ancillary or overhead services provided in conjunction with an outpatient visit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although most outpatient services will be billed based on the standard per visit fee for a specialty/subspecialty,
there are several special rules for particular types of care. One special rule is that a separate charge for the same
day/ambulatory surgery will be published annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effective date of the proposed expanded number of billing categories is targeted for October 1, 1994.
The specific rates will be published in the

C. Miscellaneous Healthcare Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Initial implementation of the Third Party Collection Program was somewhat limited in scope and concentrated on inpatient
and ambulatory care areas. We propose to expand the program to include outpatient services which may not traditionally
be provided in hospitals or which are not traditional clinical specialties or subspecialties. This includes, but
is not limited to, ambulance service, hyperbaric treatments, dental care services and immunizations. We propose
to recover the cost of these services to the extent they are generally applicable coverage provisions of a third party
payer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to recover the cost of ambulance service which includes the cost of providing emergency aid and then transportation
of beneficiaries to a medical treatment facility. It would also include the transport of patients to other medical
facilities or the specialized clinics for diagnostic or therapeutic services which also is frequently necessary.
We propose to recover costs on the basis of the length of time the ambulance is in service with one hour to be the minimum
amount billed. Our reimbursement rates for ambulance care will only cover the costs of operating the vehicle, including
labor costs (driver and attendant), supplies, fuel, and overhead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to recover the cost of hyperbaric treatments provided to beneficiaries as part of a course of treatment.
For example, high pressure oxygenation treatments, burn treatments and decompression treatments in response to
diving incidents are frequently provided. We only intend to recover the cost of providing these treatments which
includes the operating cost of the chamber, e.g., labor costs, (operators and attending medical personnel), supplies,
and overhead. We do not intend to include amortization of either the actual or replacement cost of the hyperbaric chamber
or the building.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dental services are provided to beneficiaries on a space available basis and in remote locations. Dental services
may include oral diagnosis and prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed and removable), implantology,
oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and endodontics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also provide a wide range of immunizations to Military Health Service beneficiaries, including immunizations
against common childhood diseases such as measles, smallpox and diphtheria and regional endemic diseases such as
yellow fever, plague and cholera. We also administer a variety of medications and test beneficiaries for allergic
conditions. Immunizations costs are not included as part of the reimbursement rates for either inpatient or ambulatory
care. We intend to seek reimbursement for immunizations against childhood diseases and diseases characteristic
of the United States and its Territories. We will also seek reimbursement for the administration of all medications
or allergy extracts, when the medication or extract is purchased by the medical treatment facility, and for the testing
for allergic conditions. We do not intend to seek recovery for immunizations administered incident to overseas travel
or transfer or for those medications purchased by the beneficiary and simply administered at the medical treatment
facility. Our reimbursement rate shall be based on the average fully burdened cost of an immunization and we shall
apply a separate charge for each immunization which is administered.

Finally, the proposed rule would eliminate the special provision regarding PRIMUS and NAVCARE clincis, which are
DOD's contractor owned and operated freestanding clinics. Under special demonstration program authority, these
clinics have functioned under rules applicable to military medical treatment facilities. The proposed change would
conform with other proposed regulatory action of DOD, which would make the PRIMUS/NAVCARE clinic program permanent
under the auspices of the CHAMPUS program. With this action, CHAMPUS coordination of benefits procedures, rather
than Third Party Collection Program procedures, will become applicable.

III. Regulatory Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. It would not have an impact
of $100 million or other significant economic impacts. Similarly, the rule does not significantly affect a substantial
number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As stated above, for the most part,
this proposed rule would simply incorporate into the third party collection program regulation more precise cost
calculation methods. In addition, this rule does not impose new information collection requirements for purposes
of the Paperwork Reduction Act.

(1) In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3), the calculation of reasonable costs for purposes of collections for inpatient
hospital care under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part shall be based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Costs shall be based
on the inpatient full reimbursement rate per hospital discharge, weighted to reflect the intensity of the principal
diagnosis involved. The average cost per case shall be published annually as an inpatient standardized amount. A
relative weight for each DRG shall be the same as the DRG weights published annually for hospital reimbursement rates
under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standardized amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standardized amount shall be determined by dividing the total costs of all inpatient care in all military medical
treatment facilities by the total number of discharges. This will produce a single national standardized amount.
The Department of Defense is authorized, but not required by this part to calculate three standardized amounts, one
each for large urban areas, other urban areas, and rural areas, utilizing the same distinctions in identifying those
areas as is used for CHAMPUS under 32 CFR part 199, paragraph 199.14(a)(1).

Costs for each DRG will be determined by multiplying the standardized amount per discharge by the DRG relative weight.
For this purpose, the DRG relative weights used for CHAMPUS pursuant to 32 CFR part 199, paragraph 199.14(a)(1) shall
be used.

The Department of Defense may, but is not required by this part, to adjust cost determinations in particular cases
for length-of-stay outliers (long stay and short stay), cost outliers, area wage rates, and indirect medical education.
If any such adjustments are used, the method shall be comparable to that used for CHAMPUS hospital reimbursements
pursuant to 32 CFR part 199, paragraph 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E), and the calculation of the standardized amount under
paragraph (a)(2) of this section will reflect that such adjustments will be used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of billing third party payers other than automobile liability and no-fault insurance carriers, billings
will be subdivided into three categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Hospital charges (which refers to routine services charges associated with the hospital stay). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Professional charges (which refers to professional services provided by physicians and certain other providers).

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clinical groups per diem rates for care provided on or after October 1, 1992, and prior to October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For inpatient hospital care provided on or after October 1, 1992, and prior to October 1, 1994, the computation of reasonable
costs shall be based on the per diem full reimbursement rate applicable to the clinical category of services involved.*&blank;*&blank;*

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special rule for partnership program providers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases in which the professional provider services are provided under the Partnership Program (or similar program
operated under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1096), the professional charges component of the total standard rate will
be deleted, as applicable, from the claim from the facility of the Uniformed Services. The third party payer will receive
a claim for professional services directly from the individual healthcare provider, who is not an employee or agent
of the Department of Defense. Such claims are not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part, but are governed by statutory
and regulatory requirements of the CHAMPUS program (see 32 CFR part 199). The same is true for professional services
provided on an outpatient basis under the Partnership Program.

Per visit rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(2), the computation of reasonable costs for purposes of collections for most
outpatient services shall be based on a per visit rate for a clinical specialty or subspecialty. The per visit charge
shall be equal to the outpatient full reimbursement rate for that clinical specialty or subspecialty and includes
all routine ancillary services. A separate charge will be calculated for cases that are considered same day/ambulatory
surgeries. These rates shall be updated and published annually. As with inpatient billing categories, clinical
groups representing selected board certified specialties/subspecialties widely accepted by graduate medical
accrediting organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American
Board of Medical Specialties will be used for ambulatory billing categories. Related clinical groups may be combined
for purposes of billing categories.

In cases where a facility of the Uniformed Services purchases ancillary services or procedures, from a source other
than a Uniformed Services facility, the cost of the purchased services will be added to the standard rate. Examples
of ancillary services and other procedures covered by this special rule include (but are not limited to): laboratory,
radiology, pharmacy, pulmonary function, cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis, hyperbaric medicine, electrocardiography,

If a Uniformed Services facility provides certain ancillary services, prescription drugs or other procedures based
on a request from a source other than a Uniformed Services facility and are not incident to any outpatient visit or inpatient
services, the reasonable cost will not be based on the usual per diem or per visit rate. Rather, a separate standard
rate shall be established based on the cost of the particular high-cost service, drug or procedure provided. This
special rule applies only to services, drugs or procedures having a cost of at least $60. The reasonable cost for the
services, drugs or procedures to which this special rule applies shall be calculated and published annually.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On March 1, 1994, Empire State Regatta, Inc. submitted a request to hold a fireworks program in the Hudson River at Albany,
New York, in conjunction with the annual Empire State Regatta. This proposed safety zone is being established to protect
boaters from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. No vessel would be permitted to enter or
move within this area unless authorized to do so by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, New York.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to establish a temporary safety zone that will include all waters of the Hudson River within
a 300 yard radius of a point located in land approximately 500 yards south of the New York Central Railroad Bridge on
the eastern side of the Hudson River. This proposed safety zone will leave the western half of the Hudson River, including
eighty percent of the federal channel open to vessel traffic for the duration of this event. If adopted this safety
zone will be in effect from 9 p.m. until 10:15 p.m. on June 11, 1994. This proposed safety zone is needed to protect the
boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. No vessel would permitted to enter
or move within this area unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, New York.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This rule is a significant regulatory action 12866 and is not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). Although this event will close a portion of the Hudson River,
the effect of this partial closure will not be significant for several reasons. Due to the limited duration of the event,
the late hour of the event, the extensive advisories that will be made to the affected maritime community, and that
all traffic can safely transit to the west of this safety zone, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposed
regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime
safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the Docket.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) proposes to establish a new 48 CFR Chapter 54 to contain Defense Logistics Agency
acquisition regulations. New parts 5419 and 5452 provide regulatory coverage which incorporates two nonstandard
clauses in domestic bulk petroleum solicitations and contracts concerning small business set asides and evaluation
preference for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns into DLAR on a permanent basis. Comments are hereby requested
on the proposed coverage which supplements the contract quality requirements of the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (DFARS) by adding prescriptive language and contract clauses to satisfy the specific needs
of DLA. The proposed coverage is being published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 because it is expected to have an effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DLA and, in some cases, a significant
cost or administrative impact on contractors, when required.

A. Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1207 of Public Law 99&hyph;661, as amended, sets a goal for the Department of Defense to award five percent
of contract and performance dollars to small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, historically black colleges
and universities, and minority institutions. Defense Fuel Supply Center has historically utilized deviations
to DFARS 252.219&hyph;7001 and 252.219&hyph;7006 which are reviewed and approved on an annual basis by the Director
of Defense Procurement. Defense Fuel Supply Center proposes incorporating two nonstandard clauses in DLAR in order
to eliminate the need for the class deviation. An additional objective of the two clauses is to include the term small
disadvantaged joint ventures in the definition of small disadvantaged business concerns. Small disadvantaged
joint ventures will now be eligible to receive the evaluation preference for those items solicited under these clauses
if the small disadvantaged business or small disadvantaged joint venture manufactures or supplies the products
of small disadvantaged businesses.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed clauses are not expected to have significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
since the clauses have been utilized for many years by Defense Fuel Supply Center as deviations to DFARS. Comments
are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite this case in correspondence.

The definition of ``small disadvantaged business concern'' to be used for DFSC competitive bulk solicitions and
contracts is in the provision at 5452.219&hyph;9F06 and is different from the definition in DFARS 252.219&hyph;7001.
For purposes of contract opportunities, Small Disadvantaged Business Joint Ventures, as defined in 252.219&hyph;7001
have the same status as small disadvantaged business concerns.

. (1) The term ``small disadvantaged business (SDB) concern,'' has the meaning set forth in the Representation clause
of this contract and includes the term small disadvantaged business joint venture. SDB concerns must supply petroleum
product from an SDB manufacturer who complies with the petroleum products size standards at 13 CFR part 121, to be eligible

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 10 percent factor will be applied on a line item by line item basis or to any group of items on which award may be
made. Other evaluation factors described in the solicitation will be applied before application of the 10 percent
factor. However, in no event may award be made to an SDB concern at a price which exceeds fair market price (as determined
under FAR 19.806&hyph;2) by more than ten percent (10%).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A portion of certain items of this procurement, as listed in the Schedule, has (have) been set aside for award to
eligible small businesses, with preferential consideration for SDB concerns. The quantities indicated for such
items in the Schedule include the set-aside portion. All offerors are urged to offer the maximum quantities they desire
and are capable of delivering. Small businesses and SDB concerns interested in receiving a set-aside contract should
submit an offer in the same manner as though there were no set-aside. Volumes offered by qualified small businesses
or SDB concerns will be evaluated for the non set-aside and set-aside portions of the procurement. Separate offers
should not be submitted on the non set-aside and set-aside portions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The partial small business set-aside of the procurement is based on a determination by the Contracting Officer
that it is in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the nation's full production capacity or in the interest of
national defense programs, or in the interest of assuring that a fair portion of Government procurement is placed
with small business concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All of the offers received under this solicitation will be first negotiated as to price and an evaluation will be
made as though there were no set-aside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the purposes of set-aside evaluation, when an offer contains increments at different prices, each increment
will be considered a separate offer. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below, negotiations will be limited to the
offered quantities not awarded under the provisions of subparagraph (d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Set-aside award procedure (preferential consideration for SDB concerns).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Offers from SDBs and small business concerns will be evaluated with preferential consideration, as described
below, given to eligible SDB concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Offers from SDB concerns will be reviewed first to determine if an award can be made to an SDB concern at its offered
price, beginning with the SDB concern offering the lowest evaluated price for that item. Awards to SDB concerns on
the set-aside portion of this procurement will be made at the price offered by the SDB concern if that evaluated price
does not exceed the highest award price on the non set-aside portion by more than 10 percent, as adjusted for transportation
charges and other factors. If the SDB price exceeds the highest non set-aside price by more than 10 percent, the SDB
will be treated as a small business and the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) below will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any volumes remaining on the set-aside portion that are not awarded to the lowest priced eligible SDB concern under
subparagraph (c)(2) will be awarded to any other SDBs eligible for award under the procedures set forth above, beginning
with the SDB concern offering the next lowest price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Set-aside award procedure (small business concerns).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) After evaluation and award to eligible SDB concerns, if any, negotiations will be conducted with small business
concerns for any set-aside volumes not awarded to eligible SDB concerns under paragraph (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The price for the small business set-aside portion will be negotiated by the Contracting Officer based upon prices
the Government would otherwise pay under this solicitation had there been no set-aside for supply of the location
at which the set-aside is placed, adjusted for transportation charges, and other factors. For the set-aside portion
of an item not already awarded to SDB concerns, awards will be made to the small business concern whose offer is determined
by this evaluation to be low without further negotiations. Contracts for the remaining set-aside portions will be
negotiated with those eligible small business concerns who have submitted a responsive offer on the various items
for which a set-aside has been established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Negotiations for small business set-aside awards will begin with the small business concern with the lowest evaluated
price and a quantity of offered product remaining. If the low small business concern on the item does not offer to supply
product at the set-aside price, the next low small business concern on the item will be given the same opportunity and
continuing with the next low small business concern until all small business concerns have been contacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) After the set-aside negotiations have been concluded, a final evaluation will be accomplished. All eligible
offerors, without regard to the size of the company, will be afforded an opportunity to compete for non set-aside quantities.
The Government reserves the right to make awards to the otherwise low offeror for all or any portion of the set-aside
quantities, without regard to the size of the company, if eligible SDB or small business concerns do not offer a quantity
of product sufficient to meet a set-aside requirement or do not offer to supply at the set-aside prices. The total quantity
which will be awarded a small business or an SDB offeror on both the unreserved and reserved portions will not exceed
the total quantity offered under this solicitation by such small business or SDB offerors. However, if insufficient
product is offered by small business and SDB concerns to meet the quantity set-aside for small business, SDB and small
business concerns with whom the Government has already commenced negotiations may be given an opportunity to offer
additional product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Where the Trade Agreement Act applies to the non set-aside portion, offers of eligible products will be treated
as if they were qualifying country end products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Token offers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government reserves the right to not consider token offers or offers designed to secure an unfair advantage over
other offerors eligible for the set-aside portion.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) proposes to add coverage to a proposed to 48 CFR Chapter 54, which is published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed changes affect regulations on Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses. Comments are hereby
requested on the proposed changes which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation 49.504(a)(1)
which requires the use of FAR Default clause 52.249&hyph;8. The changes are required in order to incorporate three
nonstandard clauses in bulk, bunkers, intoplane, and posts, camps, and stations petroleum solicitations and contracts
concerning fuel allocation procedures. These allocation clauses permit DFSC contractors to supply less than the
full amount of fuel contracted by the government, without being terminated for default, during periods of exceptional
fuel shortages. The proposed coverage is being published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 because it is expected to have an effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DLA and, in some cases, a significant
cost or administrative impact on contractors.

Defense Fuel Supply Center has historically utilized deviations to FAR termination for default clauses in order
to provide for contingencies in the case of fuel allocations by contractors. These deviations have been approved
on an annual basis since 1974. Defense Fuel Supply Center proposed incorporating these three nonstandard clauses
in DLAR to eliminate the need for annual review and approval. The clauses are necessary to protect potential contractors
from default proceedings and ensure the continuance of a competitive procurement environment for government petroleum
requirements. Allocation of fuel to customers on a pro rata basis during periods of extreme shortage is a standard
practice in the petroleum industry.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed clauses are not expected to have significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C1 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 since the clauses have been utilized for many years by Defense Fuel Supply Center as deviations to FAR. An initial regulatory
flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested
parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR sections will also be considered in accordance
with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite this case in correspondence.

(a) Reduced supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, for any cause beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, the total supply of crude
oil and/or refined petroleum product is reduced below the level that would have otherwise been available to the Contractor,
the Contractor allocates to its regular customers its remaining available supplies of crude oil or product, then
the Contractor may also allocate to the U.S. Government supplies to be delivered under this contract, provided_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Prompt notice of and evidence substantiating the necessity to allocate and describing the allocation rate for
all the Contractor's customers are submitted to the Contracting Officer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Allocation among the Contractor's regular customers is made on a fair and reasonable basis (except where allocation
on a different basis is required by a governmental authority, agency or instrumentality); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Reduction of the quantity of product due the Government under this contract shall not exceed the pro rata amount
by which the Contractor reduces delivery to its other customers similarly situated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after the event causing the shortage of crude oil and/or refined petroleum product as described in (a) above, additional
supply becomes available to the Contractor, the Contracting Officer may choose any one of the following three possible
courses of action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) accept an updated pro rata reduction as outlined in paragraph (a); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine that continuance of the contract with the quantities as originally stated in the Schedule is in the best
interests of the Government, in which case negotiations for an equitable adjustment in price will be properly undertaken;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Terminate the contract as permitted in paragraph (d) below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Contractor believes that a law, regulation, or order of a foreign government requires the Contractor to deliver
less than the quantity set forth in the Schedule for any location within that country, the Contractor may request allocation
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause. In addition, to the criteria in paragraph (a) above, the Contractor's
request shall cite_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The law, regulation or order, furnishing copies of the same; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The nature of the Government's waiver, exception, and enforcement procedure. The Contracting Officer will promptly
review the matter and advise the Contractor whether or not the need to allocate has been substantiated. If the law,
regulation, or order requiring the Contractor to reduce deliveries ceases to be effective, the Contractor shall
resume deliveries in accordance with the original Schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If, as a result of reduced deliveries permitted by (a), (b) or (c) above, the Contracting Officer decides that continuation
of this contract is no longer in the best interests of the Government, the Government may terminate this contract or
any quantity thereunder, by written notice, at no cost to the Government. However, the Government shall not be relieved
of its obligation to pay for supplies actually delivered to and accepted by it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Except as otherwise stated in paragraph (b), any volumes omitted pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this clause
shall be deleted from this contract, and the Contractor shall have no continuing obligation, so far as this contract
is concerned, to make up such omitted supplies.

the quantity of product due the Government under this contact on a pro rata basis with the Contractor's other regular
customers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subpart E of the Student Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 668) governs the verification of the information that is used to calculate
an applicant's expected family contribution (EFC) as part of the determination of an applicant's need for student
financial assistance. Based on the need analysis formula established in the statute, the EFC is the amount that an
applicant and the applicant's family can reasonably be expected to contribute towards the applicant's cost of attendance
at an institution of higher education.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Summary of Proposed Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to change the requirement in &sect;668.54 that determines the percentage of selected applicants
required to be verified annually by an institution in any award year. The Secretary also proposes to change the amount
of the dollar tolerance option in &sect;668.59 for the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Direct
Student Loan, campus-based, and Presidential Access Scholarship programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has amended &sect;668.54 to remove the 30 percent verification limitation and require institutions
to verify all selected applicants. This change is required by the deletion of section 484(f) of the Higher Education
Act of 1965, as amended, by the enactment of the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. The Secretary is extending
an invitation to comment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if there should be an option available to institutions to not verify more than a certain percentage of applicants
and if so, what would be an appropriate percentage and evidence for that threshold. The new percentage would be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, after all comments from the aid community have been reviewed and analyzed by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes a $400 tolerance option to be used for all Title IV programs in place of the prior $200 Pell
and $800 Stafford Loan and campus-based tolerance options. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 provided a single
formula for establishing need for all Title IV student financial assistance programs. Under one of the former need
analysis formulas,

Congressional Methodology, a larger tolerance for calculating the EFC was allowed because it did not result in a change
in the applicant's award. In determining the single $400 tolerance figure for all Title IV programs, the Secretary
analyzed the data to determine the appropriate tolerance amount that would not result in a change in the applicant's
award.

Under the change proposed, one tolerance for all applicants would be used and that would not differ depending on the
specific programs to which the student is applying for assistance. The Secretary considers the value of this simplification
of the regulations to outweigh any potential loss in flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of a new tolerance amount to be used in the calculation of an applicant's EFC would not establish a new
policy. Institutions are currently using tolerance amounts in the calculation of an applicant's EFC. However, since
the Secretary would be implementing a new single tolerance amount and deleting the zero PGI charts to simplify the
processing of Title IV assistance, the Secretary requests public comment on the establishment of the $400 tolerance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will issue final changes to &sect;&sect;668.54 and 668.59 of these regulations following an opportunity
for public comment in response to the proposed changes listed above.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities affected by these regulations are small institutions of higher education.
However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the small institutions affected because
the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The
regulations would impose minimal requirements necessary to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture proposes to revise the National Forest System rangeland management regulations to
update direction for management of domestic livestock, to place grater emphasis on stewardship of the rangeland
resource, to clarify the link between the livestock grazing permit and forest plans, and to clarify the range management
planning and decisionmaking process. In addition, the Department proposes to improve administration of livestock
grazing permits, and to achieve greater consistency between the grazing management regulations of the Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior. The intended effect of this proposed rule is to
provide for healthy, diverse, sustainable rangeland ecosystems on National Forest System lands.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing rule governing rangeland management and livestock use on National Forest System lands and other lands
under Forest Service control (36 CFR part 222, subpart A) provides guidance for management of the range environment
and addresses the issuance and modification of grazing and livestock use permits, compensation for permittees'
interest in authorized permanent improvements, cooperation in management, rangeland improvements, the use of
the range betterment fund, and grazing advisory boards. The current rule was adopted October 28, 1977 (42 FR 56732).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1, Forest Service personnel involved with rangeland management
participated in a review of the existing grazing regulations in 1987. This review identified some parts of the existing
regulations that required revision and clarification, and other parts that were outdated and required removal.
In addition, several issues not covered by the regulations were identified that need to be addressed in the rules.
The Forest Service published a proposed rule responding to the findings of the review on August 16, 1988 (53 FR 30954).
That proposed rule was not finalized, but principal features of and comments received on that proposed rule have been
considered in the current effort to identify needed changes to the rangeland management and grazing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 RPA Program, entitled ``The Forest Service Program for Forest and Rangeland Resource,'' states the following:
``The condition of public rangeland is better today than it has been at any other time this century. However, the Forest
Service is deeply concerned about those rangelands in unsatisfactory condition, which, in 1989, consisted of 27
percent of all suitable National Forest System rangeland acres.'' The 1990 RPA Program further discussed the role
of rangelands in providing forage, habitat, water, recreational opportunities, and open space and signaled the
agency's commitment to improve rangeland conditions and management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More recently, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior sponsored a series of public meetings
on livestock grazing on federal lands. Issues and concerns raised at those meetings have provided additional momentum
to develop grazing regulations that are more responsive to the current need for improved management of rangeland
resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on Friday, August 13, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, (58 FR 43202), in which the Department of Agriculture gave notice of its intent to revise its grazing and livestock
use and grazing fee (36 CFR 222 subpart A and subpart C) rules to respond to the Administration's commitment to implement
federal rangeland management reform. The Department of the Interior issued an ANPR concurrent (58 FR 43208) with
the Department of Agriculture's in which it announced its proposed grazing regulation changes for BLM lands, including
the grazing fee system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of about 12,600 letters were received on the ANPR's published by the Department of the Interior and the Department
of Agriculture. These letters included over 56,000 separate comments on various aspects of grazing administration
and fees. The greatest number of comments addressed possible changes in the grazing fee. Comments also identified
a need for protection of rangeland ecosystems through an ecosystem approach to management and the use of locally developed
standards and guidelines. Other concerns included the suitability of land for grazing and the need for balance between
livestock grazing and other forest uses with the ability to implement and enforce the necessary management. A healthy
and productive human environment with opportunities for public participation in planning decisions also received
support from many respondents. Also, frequently noted in the comments was the longstanding role of land steward played
by grazing permittees. A large number of comments highlighted the need for consistency between regulations of the
Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comment received on the ANPR, the Secretary of Agriculture has decided to separate the rulemaking for
grazing fees from the rulemaking for other grazing and livestock use proposals identified in the ANPR. Comments on
the grazing fee portion of the ANPR will be considered in the development of the final grazing fee rule. Reviewers need
not resubmit comments they filed on the Department of Agriculture's ANPR in order for them to be considered by the agency
in the preparation of the final rule. All comments received on the Department of Agriculture's ANPR and this proposed
rule will be considered in the preparation of a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, by separate rule, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing a revision of their grazing management regulations
and a revised system for determining livestock grazing fees on the public lands they administer. The fee system proposed
by the BLM is similar to that proposed by the Forest Service.

Proposed Revisions to 36 CFR Part 222, Subpart A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules of Subpart A currently focus exclusively on issuance and administration of livestock grazing permits.
Under the proposed rule, this Subpart would be retitled ``Management of Grazing Use Within Rangeland Ecosystems''
signaling the Department's intent to plan for rangeland activities and to regulate grazing use within an ecosystem
management framework. In addition, the structure of the Subpart would be extensively revised to improve the flow
and order of the text. To assist readers, a redesignation table which shows the disposition of provisions of the current
rule is set out at the end of this preamble. Finally, extensive editorial revisions have been made to existing provisions
to improve clarity of the rule, to remove gender specific pronoun references, to remove passive voice, and to correct
spelling and punctuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets forth the purpose of the rule as governing domestic livestock grazing on National Forest System
lands and other lands under Forest Service control. The scope of the rule, as described in this proposed section, is
to specifically address decision points related to NEPA procedures for determining suitability for and authorization
of grazing use and to address specific and general requirements and standards related to the issuance and administration
of grazing permits.

Proposed Section 222.2_Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the current rule, definitions are set out in &sect;222.1 entitled ``Authority and definitions.'' Because existing
paragraph (a) of &sect;222.1 is a restatement of the authority delegated to the Chief of the Forest Service by the Assistant
Secretary at 7 CFR 2.60, this paragraph would be removed and &sect;222.2 would be limited solely to definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed rule, a number of terms would be added, revised, or removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Terms Proposed To Be Added
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms and their definitions would be added:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
affiliates
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is used to denote entities that have a business relationship with permit applicants or holders. The term is used in
proposed &sect;222.7 in relation to determinations that the applicants have satisfactory records of performance.
The definition is derived from the definition of affiliation used by the Small Business Administration and found
at 13 CFR 121.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
authorized officer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 needs to be defined because it is used throughout the subpart. The term and the definition is consistent with the use
of this term under 36 CFR part 251, which governs administration of special use authorizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
escrow waiver
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is used within the subpart and needs to be defined. The term has been used by permittees and the Forest Service since
1938. The definition in the proposed rule is derived from the definition currently found in the Forest Service Grazing
Permit Administration Handbook 2209.13, Chapter 10 (36 CFR part 200).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Forest System lands in the Eastern States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be added for ease of reference and to distinguish certain livestock management provisions that apply solely
in the Western United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Where grazing permit requirements apply only to lands in the Western United States, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Forest System lands in the Western States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NEPA procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is used throughout the subpart to refer to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Revisions of Existing Terms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms in the current rule are proposed to be revised:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
allotment management plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be limited to defining allotment management plans and removes regulatory text that is inappropriately included
as part of the definition in the current rule. While under proposed &sect;222.3 the agency is proposing to eliminate
allotment management plans, the term is needed to address authorization of grazing within the transitional procedures
established in this section of the proposed rule.

2. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be revised for clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
16 contiguous Western States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be reworded for clarity and brevity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
livestock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be clarified by specifying that the term means foraging animals and by adding that the animals are raised for
livestock production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Forest System lands
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be revised to conform to the statutory definition found in 16 U.S.C. 1609.

7. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
other lands under Forest Service control
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be shortened and clarified by substituting the words ``other means'' for ``otherwise.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
permitted livestock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be expanded to include those livestock grazed under a permit during the preceding season, including offspring
retained for herd replacement. This change reflects the current practice of recognizing these animals as permitted
livestock when approving waivers of permits based on the sale of permitted livestock.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
transportation livestock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Terms Proposed To Be Removed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms found in the current rule are not included in the proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
livestock use permit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be removed since this type of use would be covered through a temporary permit as described in &sect;222.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The definitions of the terms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
temporary grazing permit, term permits, on-and-off grazing permits,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Proposed Section 222.3_Framework for Rangeland Planning and Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule provides the context in which plans and decisions regarding rangeland management
on National Forest System lands are made. This includes the decision to authorize grazing. This section would adopt
the two-tiered planning and decisionmaking framework established by the Chief of the Forest Service through two
key administrative appeal decisions (Panhandle LRMP Appeal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, proposed paragraph (a) would recognize that rangeland planning and decisions occur through the land
and resource management planning process set out in 36 CFR part 219 and that forest plans, establish the programmatic
direction for rangeland management on the forest which includes goals, objectives, standards, guidelines, and
an identification of lands suitable for livestock grazing. Finally, proposed paragraph (a) makes clear that a determination
in the forest plan that lands are suitable for grazing is not a decision to authorize grazing. This latter declaration
is included in the rule to eliminate recurring permittee and public confusion over the distinction between a grazing
suitability determination and a grazing authorization decision. The first determination_the suitability of lands
for grazing_must be made before a decision to authorize grazing can be made, but a grazing suitability determination
does not necessarily lead to a decision to graze those lands. Even though lands may be suitable for grazing, other resource
objectives may take precedence over grazing livestock; for example, protection needs of wildlife habitat might
have a higher priority in a given area and thus grazing use would be incompatible with that objective.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While programmatic rangeland management direction is made in forest plans, proposed paragraph (b) makes clear that,
except as otherwise provided in this section, a rangeland project decision would be required when site-specific
activities that implement management direction in the forest plan are proposed. Examples of rangeland project decisions
given in the proposed rule include, but are not limited to, maintenance or modification of specific plant communities
or riparian, aquatic, soil, or other resource conditions needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives
of the forest plan; rangeland improvements needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest
plan; and authorization of livestock grazing, where it is suitable and appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A significant aspect of the framework for planning and decisionmaking as proposed in this rule is the streamlining
and simplification of rangeland planning. Under this proposed rule, allotment management plans, currently prepared
on an allotment-by-allotment basis, would be eliminated. There has been considerable permittee and internal agency
confusion over how allotment management plans fit into the agency's decisionmaking and environmental analysis
framework. These allotment management plans appear to create a middle tier of planning and decisionmaking related
to rangeland management that does not conform to the two-tier planning and decisionmaking process used in planning
for all other forest resources. By eliminating allotment management plans, the proposed rule would conform rangeland
management planning to the process applicable to all other uses and thus, clarify when and where livestock grazing
and livestock use decisions are made. While the agency proposes to eliminate the use of allotment management plans,
the Forest Service still intends to fully consult with and involve grazing permittees and other affected parties
in rangeland planning and decisionmaking as required in both NEPA and the National Forest Management Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is generally at the site-specific project level that authorization of livestock grazing is made and the site-specific
environmental effects of alternatives are fully analyzed and disclosed. For this reason, proposed paragraph (b)(l)(iii)
specifies that, where a rangeland project decision authorizes livestock grazing, the decision must also specify
the maximum permissible amount of grazing use, the timing and duration of such use, and other appropriate livestock
management requirements or measures needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan.
Further, paragraph (b)(3) clarifies that where a rangeland project decision has been made that authorizes livestock
grazing, the timely issuance of the grazing permit is an administrative act and not a separate decision subject to
additional NEPA analysis and disclosure. Inclusion of this provision is intended to avoid any confusion about administrative
appeal points and to make clear that issuance of a grazing permit is not the decision point, provided the grazing permit
is issued within a reasonable timeframe of the authorization decision and the environmental effects disclosed in
the rangeland project decision are still current.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a decision to authorize grazing use may be made in a forest plan as long as there is adequate analysis and documentation
of the environmental effects, it is generally more practicable to make a livestock grazing use decision and disclose
the environmental effects of grazing at the project decision level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency intends to move toward rangeland project decisionmaking at broader ecological scales, these project
level decisions cannot be undertaken and completed immediately upon adoption of the final rule. In light of the approximately
4500 Forest Service grazing permits subject to renewal in 1995, transitional procedures are thus needed to guide
the agency over the short term. Under proposed paragraph (c), the agency would utilize a screening approach that permits
a smooth transition for the reauthorization of grazing permits and completion of rangeland project decisions. This
approach balances the interests of permittees with the need for compliance with environmental law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3), and (4) address the situations where a rangeland project decision to authorize
grazing use does not exist. Specifically, proposed paragraph (c)(1) would permit the authorized officer to issue
a term grazing permit for up to ten years on allotments where there is a current allotment management plan and where
the NEPA documentation associated with that management plan is also current. This provision is necessary since in
many cases there are current allotment plans that are consistent with forest plan standards and guidelines and are
sufficient to guide rangeland management in the foreseeable future. This provision would allow for the smooth transition
from allotment management plans to rangeland project decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would permit the authorized officer to issue a term grazing permit for up to ten years based
on an approved forest plan for allotments that are meeting, or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives.
In this situation, the forest plan must contain applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated as terms
and conditions of the grazing permit and the environmental effects of applying the standards and guidelines on the
land must be analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the allotment is meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives but the forest
plan does not contain applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated as terms and conditions of the
permit, the authorized officer would be prohibited, pursuant to proposed paragraph (c)(3), from renewing or issuing
a new term permit of more than three years duration. In those situations where allotments are meeting or moving toward
achievement of forest plan goals and objectives, paragraph (c)(3) would allow the authorized officer to issue a term
permit of up to three years duration while the agency gathers information and conducts the necessary analysis to determine
if grazing should be authorized or a different term should be established. Issuance of 1-3 year term permits in this
situation would require disclosure of the short term environmental effects of grazing under the permit pursuant
to NEPA procedures. This term permit provision is needed to prevent undue impact on operators who are in compliance
with the terms and conditions of their permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4) addresses those situations where allotments are not meeting or moving toward forest plan goals
and objectives. In this situation, the authorized officer cannot issue a new ten year term permit until a rangeland
project decision and disclosure of environmental effects are accomplished. However, the authorized officer may
issue a term permit for a period of up to three years until a rangeland project decision is completed. The term permit
to be issued during this transition period must include applicable forest plan standards and guidelines and/or any
other measures necessary to move management of the allotment toward forest plan goals and objectives. Prior to issuance
of the 1&hyph;3 year term permit, the environmental effects of continuing grazing under the permit must be disclosed
pursuant to NEPA procedures. This term permit provision provides for resource protection and prevents undue impact
on operators while rangeland project decisions are being prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fundamental to proposed paragraphs (c)2, 3, and 4, is the necessity for the agency to make a determination as to whether
management of a given allotment is or is not meeting or moving toward forest plan goals and objectives. The programmatic
direction in forest plans establishes goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines for management of the resources
on the National Forests, including management of rangelands. Forest plan goals and objectives are designed to promote
achievement of desired resource conditions on the land. Site specific projects implementing the forest plan must
be consistent with forest plan standards and guidelines, which provide for resource protection in the achievement
of forest plan goals and objectives. Under the transitional procedures proposed in this section, agency employees
would determine whether management of an allotment is meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and
objectives through forest plan and allotment monitoring and evaluation, allotment field inspections, other existing
resource information, and professional judgment.

The exhibit at the end of this document outlines the tiered screening approach proposed in paragraphs (c)(1)&hyph;(4)
to guide issuance of grazing permits in compliance with NEPA procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Klamath, Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity, and Six Rivers National Forests in the state of California
are without approved forest plans. Under the provisions of the planning regulations (36 CFR 219.29) these national
forests continue to be managed under existing land use and resource plans. In such cases, provisions of proposed paragraph
(c)(1), (3), and (4) would provide a reasonable mechanism for the continuation of livestock operations which are
in compliance with the terms and conditions of their permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is committed to the long term improvement of rangeland condition. Therefore, proposed paragraph (c)(5)
would require the authorized officer to develop and maintain a schedule for rangeland project decisions and site
specific disclosure of environmental effects on affected allotments pursuant to NEPA procedures. These schedules
will be developed in consultation with grazing permittees and other interested parties. Priority for scheduling
the completion of rangeland project decisions will be given to those areas with significant resource concerns such
as protection of threatened and endangered species, riparian and aquatic habitat, and water quality. These schedules
are necessary to ensure an orderly transition for completion of rangeland project decisions through both the short
term (1&hyph;3 years) and long term (10&hyph;13 years). It it not the intent of the transitional procedures proposed
in this section to avoid or delay the completion of rangeland project decisions, but rather to complete rangeland
project decisions on all allotments within 13 years from the effective date of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(6) of this section clarifies that where grazing permits are issued under the transitional procedures
of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4), the timely issuance of a grazing permit is an administrative act and not a separate
decision subject to additional NEPA analysis and disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(7) of this section states that adoption of these rules would not compel the agency to immediately initiate
rangeland project planning and decisionmaking. This provision is necessary to prevent any claim or assertion that,
upon the effective date of this rule, the agency would intend to immediately initiate rangeland project decisions
for issuance or renewal of all grazing permits. This provision also provides the necessary transitions from the current
allotment-by-allotment decisionmaking process to a more streamlined process for future decisionmaking in an orderly
and planned manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;222.3 of the proposed rule requires the authorized officer to delineate lands suitable and
authorized for grazing use into allotments. The introductory text retains the current policy of including nonfederal
lands in an allotment where doing so would form logical management units. Proposed paragraph (d)(1) would require
that maps delineating allotments must be on file at the office of the District Ranger. Proposed paragraph (d)(2) would
make clear that the delineation of allotments is merely an administrative act and not a decision subject to further
NEPA analysis for disclosure of environmental effects. The intent is to eliminate confusion and future disputes
over the decision point, the requisite environmental disclosure requirements, and administrative appeal opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, proposed &sect;222.3 would make clear that planning and decisionmaking for National Forest System rangeland
management, including authorization of livestock grazing use, is a two-level process, just as is the case for all
other National Forest resources. As a consequence, the agency would discontinue the use of the allotment management
plan. Additionally, this section signals the agency's intent and provides the foundation for moving toward an ecological
approach to rangeland management decisions. Under an ecological approach, the agency will seek to focus on appropriate
larger geographic scales for ecological analysis purposes, while incorporating and building on the best science
available to ensure the sustainability of the land to continue to produce goods and services to meet public demand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPR, the Department specifically asked the public for input on appropriate scales of rangeland ecosystem
analysis. Public comments received support a broader scope of analysis and planning with consideration of the human
element of the ecosystem. However, mandating a particular hierarchical level of analysis for planning is inappropriate
in this proposed rule on rangeland management. The framework for overall agency land management planning and planning
for all resources must be set out in a cohesive and integrated way in the agency's land management planning regulations
in Part 219. Accordingly, the comments received on the scales of rangeland ecosystem analysis and planning in response
to the ANPR on rangeland management will be considered in the agency's development of a proposed revision of the land
management planning regulations, which is now underway.

Proposed Section 222.4_General Provisions Applicable to All Grazing Permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule establishes some of the fundamental ground rules governing grazing on National
Forest System land and other lands under Forest Service control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 222.4(a) of the proposed rule is essentially the same as &sect;222.3(a) of the current rule and provides that
grazing activities require written authorization in the form of a grazing permit. Similar to current practice, certain
minor exceptions for temporary grazing are allowed under proposed &sect;222.6(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;222.4(b), the proposed rules describes the permit as a privilege subject to the terms and conditions contained
therein. As in the current rule, &sect;222.3(b), proposed &sect;222.4(b) states that the grazing permit does not
convey any right, title, or interest in United States lands, resources, or permanent range improvements to the permittee.
This is entirely consistent with statutory and case law which, for nearly a century has recognized grazing permits
as a license or privilege to use federal lands for grazing activities which can be revoked at anytime without requiring
the payment of compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.4(c) states that the issuance of the grazing permit implements an existing decision to authorize
grazing and that issuance of the permit is an administrative act that is not a decision point subject to NEPA procedures
as provided in &sect;222.3(b)(3) of this subpart. This provision is intended to eliminate the confusion of permittees
and the public regarding the role of the grazing permit in management of National Forest System rangelands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (d) would require the authorized officer to prescribe the terms and conditions of each grazing
permit in accordance with applicable law and administrative direction. Paragraph (d)(1) of &sect;222.4 of the proposed
rule parallels the intent of the current rule at &sect;222.2(c). However, in contrast to the current rule, proposed
paragraph (d)(1) makes clear that terms and conditions of the permit include applicable standards and guidelines
from the forest plan and/or from applicable rangeland project decisions. This provision of the proposed rule replaces
the allotment management plan as the basis of the terms and conditions of the permit and ties the permit terms and conditions
to the two-tiered planning and decisionmaking process, as discussed earlier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulations recognize an allotment management plan (AMP) as the mechanism for carrying out forest plan
direction on a grazing allotment. The proposed rule would phase out the AMP as a source of direction for rangeland management
and grazing use and, instead, make applicable standards and guidelines from forest plans and/or from applicable
rangeland project decisions a part of the terms and conditions of the grazing permit. This provision is significant
in that it would provide the means for ensuring that those current grazing operations authorized without benefit
of rangeland project decisions would comply with the direction of forest plans. As previously noted, many of those
who submitted comments on the ANPR recommended adoption of local standards and guidelines because they would be relevant
to the land being affected by the action. On National Forest System lands, the forest plan and project decisions fulfill
this role.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (d)(2) of &sect;222.4 of the proposed rule, the permittee may be required to collect and submit monitoring,
inventory, or other resource information related to the permitted livestock grazing activity. Information of this
nature is essential for identifying progress toward forest plan goals and objectives and changes in operational
practices which may be necessary. This information is vital to proper rangeland management and in some instances
the permittee is in a better position to gather the information than the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of &sect;222.4 of the proposed rule allows the authorized officer to issue written annual operating
instructions that document temporary stocking adjustments and/or provide additional direction necessary for
proper management of the range resource. While not explicitly covered in the current rule, this is a long-standing
agency practice provided for in the agency's internal directive system and in part 2 of the term grazing permit (Form
FS&hyph;2222&hyph;10). Until now, most written instructions have been contained in annual operating plans provided
to the permittees. These annual operating plans have been the subject of increasing controversy over whether decisions
made therein are subject to NEPA procedures. Proposed paragraph (e) would make clear that where operating instructions
fall within the scope of the decision authorizing the grazing use and NEPA documentation associated with that decision,
a new decision and additional analysis is not required. If, however, they fall outside the scope of the decision authorizing
grazing use, additional environmental analysis would be required before those annual operating instructions can
be issued.

Annual adjustments documented in operating instructions would be prepared with the involvement of the permittee.
This approach conforms to current practices and helps insure permittee involvement and mutual understanding of
rangeland management and operational objectives. The agency believes the elimination of annual operating plans
and the adoption of operating instructions will reduce current confusion over how grazing use decisions are made
and lead to more uniform understanding of grazing permit administration by both agency employees and external groups
who are interested in national forest rangeland resources.

Proposed Section 222.5_Term Grazing Permits; Types and Duration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule describes the types of term grazing permits which may be issued. This includes term
permits, term private land permits, term permits with on-and-off provisions, and grazing agreements. These four
types of permits are necessary because of the various grazing use and land ownership patterns which occur on National
Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.5(a) contains descriptions of the various types of term permits authorized. This same information
is covered at &sect;223.3(c)(1) in the current rule and in the Forest Service directives system. The types of term
permits listed in the proposed rule are the same as those provided in the current rule. This section of the proposed
rule contains no change in current practice and, therefore, would have no effect on permittees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(1) covers the circumstances where a term permit is appropriate. In addition, a provision
for a term grazing association permit, which is presently provided for in Forest Service Manual (FSM) Chapter 2230,
would be incorporated into the proposed rule. Proposed paragraph (a)(2) describes a term private land permit which
is issued to a qualified applicant who owns or controls land within an allotment. The permit waives exclusive grazing
use of the private land to the United States and in return the applicant is authorized to graze livestock on the allotment.
The amount of livestock grazing use authorized in a term private land grazing permit is determined by the authorized
officer. A term permit with on-and-off provisions described in proposed paragraph (a)(3) is issued when the grazing
area includes grazing lands other than the lands under Forest System control. Under this type of permit, the livestock
graze concurrently on National Forest Service lands and other lands controlled by the applicant. Proposed paragraph
(a)(4) describes the circumstances when a grazing agreement is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.5(b) establishes the duration of term grazing permits which, normally, is for a 10 year period.
Proposed paragraph (b)(1) contains direction presently found in &sect;222.3(c)(1) of the current rule which describes
those instances when a term grazing permit on National Forest land in the 16 contiguous Western States may be issued
for a period less than the maximum ten year time period as provided for in FLPMA. Under proposed paragraph (b)(2) of
this section, the authorized officer may issue permits on all other National Forest System lands or other lands under
Forest Service control for up to a ten year period as determined to be in the best interest of sound land management.

Propsed Section 222.6_Authorization of Temporary Grazing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides that, when term permits are not appropriate for administration of livestock grazing,
a paid or free temporary permit can be issued or free grazing without a permit can be allowed. Issuance of these permits
or allowance of free use is dependent upon the availability of forage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations found in &sect;222.3(c)(2) provide for either a temporary or a livestock use permit depending
on the particular situation. Section 222.3(c)(2)(i) provides for temporary grazing permits to be issued for a period
of up to one year for a variety of purposes. Section 222.3(c)(2)(ii) provides for the issuance of livestock use permits
for periods up to one year for a variety of purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using two types of permits to cover temporary livestock grazing uses is often confusing and requires maintenance
and use of two policies and procedures, applications, and permits. Thus, the Department proposes to eliminate livestock
use permits, combine them with temporary permits, and extend the term period for temporary permits for up to three
years. These changes will streamline and simplify the issuance of temporary permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule eliminates the provision in the current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii)(D) for free livestock grazing
use for persons who reside on ranch or agricultural lands within or contiguous to National Forest System lands for
not to exceed 10 head of owned or kept livestock whose products are consumed or whose services are used directly by the
family of the resident who distinctly needs National Forest System lands to support such animals. The proposed rule
does not retain this provision since a review of permit administration revealed no use of or need for this authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(4) of &sect;222.6 of the proposed rule provide the same requirements as found in the current
rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(i)(A)&hyph;(D) for the issuance of temporary permits for a variety of purposes. The proposed
rule makes not substantive change from the current rule; however, the text of these paragraphs is revised and reduced
for clarification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule specifies that temporary permits may be issued in times of national or regional drought or emergency
where such use would not result in permanent resource damage. This provision is retained in this proposed rule at &sect;222.6(a)(5),
but is revised. Limiting this provision to drought or emergency that is ``national or regional scope'' is excessive
to the qualifications established for temporary grazing use of other lands by permitted livestock from an affected
allotment. Additionally, the qualifying phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* where such use would not result in permanent
resource damage,'' would be removed since this qualification is unnecessary. Part of a determination that the capacity
exists to graze animals is that any such grazing use permitted will be done in accordance with appropriate standards
and guidelines in a forest plan or rangeland project decision to prevent resource damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of &sect;222.6 of the proposed rule provide the same requirements as found in the current
rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii) (A) and (H), concerning temporary permits for transportation livestock an animals
used for breeding purposes. The proposed rule makes no substantive changes from the current rule; however, the text
of these paragraphs is revised and reduced for clarification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii)(C) allows free or paid permits for trailing livestock that graze along
the way as they cross National Forest System lands. Issuing free permits for such use is not in the public interest and
must be closely administered to prevent excessive use and potential resource damage. As a result, the proposed rule
at &sect;222.6(a)(8) would allow authorized officers to issue only paid temporary permits for trailing livestock
across National Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service control. This should not result in a substantial
increase in the cost of business since, in many instances, there may be alternatives to trailing that do not require
the payment of a grazing fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of this proposed section would allow an authorized officer the discretion to issue free or paid temporary
permits where the primary documented objective is managing vegetation to meet a resource objective other than livestock
forage utilization. Where the primary land management objective is to ``manipulate vegetation'' (as opposed to
livestock production), the current regulations at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii)(I) require that a fee be charged for this
use. The agency believes this fee requirement is an impediment to effective vegetative management. In some areas,
vegetation, such as chaparral, is best managed by grazing livestock. Permitting free use could be a cost-effective
way to manage fuelbreaks, tree plantations, or other areas where it is desirable to remove vegetation periodically.
In these situations, grazing can be used instead of more costly methods involving herbicides, fire, or mowing. The
temporary permits for vegetation management issued under this authority would not replace existing grazing permits
where the primary purpose if livestock production and the permittee pays a fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii)(E) provides for free permits to campers and travelers for the livestock
used during the period of occupancy. This same provision is carried forth into the proposed rule at paragraph (c)(1)
of proposed &sect;222.6. Livestock use under this provision does not included livestock being used by campers and
travelers permitted under the provisions of paragraph (a)(6) of this section which covers use by transportation
livestock for commercial purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii)(B) allows for free or paid grazing for research purposes and administrative
studies but requires the issuance of a permit. Under the proposed rule at &sect;222.6(c)(2), authorized offices
may provide for this type of grazing use free of charge without a written permit. Experience shows that the amount of
grazing permitted under this authority is insignificant. Most of the livestock involved in such studies are owned
by permitted and are authorized and paid for under a term grazing permit. Where a university or other research entity
owns or borrows the livestock used in a study, it is in the interest of the United States to allow such use free of charge
and without a written permit, since the public will benefit from the information gained from the research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3) of proposed &sect;222.6 would allow authorized officers to grant free grazing with no permit to
permittees for horses, mules, or burros that are used to support the management of permitted livestock. This type
of free grazing use is appropriate when the animal is not grazed full time on the allotment but is used occasionally
as a work animal during the grazing season. This is a revision of the provision of the current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(2)(ii)(F),
which allows for this type of permitted use on either a free or paid basis.

Proposed Section 222.7_Requirements Applicable to Grazing Permits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule contains the requirements which must be met in order to hold a term or temporary grazing
permit. Proposed paragraph (a) lists the requirements for term and temporary grazing permits while paragraph (b)
covers all additional requirements applicable specifically to term permits. The proposed rule is similar in content
to the current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(1) and existing agency direction with two primary differences. First, the
proposed requirements would enable foreign corporations to hold grazing permits, and second, this proposed rule
would establish a satisfactory record of performance under previous or currently held federal grazing permits as
a requirement for the issuance or renewal of a grazing permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.7(a)(1) would limit issuing term and temporary grazing permits to private individuals, grazing
associations and districts, business concerns, or tribal governments, making it clear that government agencies
are not eligible to receive term or temporary grazing permits. This is consistent with &sect;222.3(c)(1) of the current
rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;222.7 of the proposed rule requires eligible individuals or entities seeking a grazing
permit to make written application, using one of the forms listed in &sect;222.12. Currently this requirement is
established in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration Handbook, FSH 2209.13, section 14, which provides
that applicants must submit an application and any other information requested by the authorized officer in order
for the officer to determine that all permit requirements have been satisfied. This requirement belongs with other
requirements in the rules rather in agency directives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;222.7 of the proposed rule requires that applicants, permittee(s), and affiliates(s),
have a satisfactory record of performance under previous or currently held federal grazing permits to be eligible
for a permit. An applicant, permittee, or affiliate, if any, with a history of prior grazing use on federal lands that
has had a Forest Service grazing permit canceled, in whole, pursuant to &sect;222.10(b) (2), (3), (4), or (5), or other
federal grazing permits cancelled for similar reasons within 36 months prior to application, would be presumed to
have an unsatisfactory performance record. This provision is a substantive change from the existing rule and would
conform with the intent of FLPMA which requires that, in order to be given first priority for receipt of a new grazing
permit, existing permittees must be in compliance with the terms and conditions in the permit and any applicable rules
and regulations. Under the current rule, permittees who have their permits cancelled because they have violated
their permit terms and conditions may, be reorganizing as a new entity, remain eligible to hold a permit provided that
they are otherwise qualified. This situation is contrary to the public interest and to the intent of FLPMA and would
be remedied by this proposed &sect;222.7(a)(3) which would protect the public interest by allowing only those who
have satisfactory performance records to hold a grazing permit. In determining eligibility for a new permit or for
reissuance of a permit, under the proposed rule an authorized officer would consider current performance under federal
grazing permits held at the time of application as well as performance under other federal grazing permits held within
the past 36 months. A 36-month period is believed to be a reasonable period of time to consider in establishing a record
of performance under grazing permits. This consideration would extend to any affiliates of the applicant or permittee
and would include review of all federal grazing permits or leases held by those parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 222.7(b) of the proposed rule establishes additional requirements that are applicable only to term grazing
permits. Specifically, &sect;222.7(b)(1) would establish that term permits may only be issued to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A citizen of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An alien who has filed a petition for naturalization with the proper authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A corporation or other business concern that is authorized to do business in the state where the graving activity
is sought or is otherwise licensed to do business in that state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Tribal governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2231.21) identifies who is eligible for a grazing permit. These eligibility
standards belong with the other requirements in regulation, not in an internal agency directive, and, therefore,
and being incorporated in the proposed rule at &sect;222.7(b). The current Forest Service eligibility requirements
do not allow corporations or other business concerns to hold a grazing permit unless 80% of the capital stock is held
by American citizens (FSM 2231.21). This policy would be eliminated by adoption of the proposed rule, which at &sect;222.7(b)(1)(iii)
would allow foreign corporations or other business concerns to hold a grazing permit if they are licensed to do business
in the state in which the grazing permit is sought. This change will make eligibility requirements for graving permits
consistent with requirements for all other Forest Service permits and with those of the Bureau of Land Management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 222.7(b)(2) of the proposed rule would establish that an applicant or permit holder must own the livestock
to be graved under permit and such base property as required by the Forest Service. This requirement is the same as that
in &sect;222.3(c)(1)(i) of the current rule. However, in contrast to the current rule, the proposed rule would allow
for five exceptions to the livestock ownership requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first exception is at proposed &sect;222.7(b)(2)(i) and would allow livestock owned by children of permittees
to be run under the parents' term grazing permit for up to 50 percent of the permitted numbers. The inclusion of this
section makes an existing Forest Service practice currently authorized in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration
Handbook (FSH 2209.13, sec. 12.22) a part of the grazing regulations. The intent of this exception is to allow children
who own livestock for 4&hyph;H, Future Farmers of America, or similar projects, or those who want to build up their
own livestock herd and ultimately take over the family ranch operation, to run livestock under the parents' permit
and to encourage family operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second exception, &sect;222.7(b)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule, recognizes that where the permit or agreement
is issued to a grazing association or district, the members of the association or district must own the requisite base
property and livestock as specified in the term permit or grazing agreement. This is consistent with the intent of
the current rule (&sect;222.7) and agency practice as provided in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration
Handbook (FSH 2209.13, Chapter 20). Thus, the agency has concluded this provision belongs in the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the third exception, &sect;222.7(b)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule, holders of term private land permits would
not be required to own the livestock or base property under Forest Service permit. This is current agency practice
as provided in the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2231.22c). However, it belongs in the rules and, accordingly, is incorporated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth exception, at G222.7(b)(2)(iv) of the proposed rule, provides that term permit holders for developing
ranges on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States would not be required to own livestock or base property
for the initial permit, but must meet the livestock and base property ownership requirements for permit renewal.
This provision, which is not in the current rule, would allow new livestock operators to get into the livestock business
incrementally. This flexibility is desirable in the Eastern States where the Forest Service administers areas where
vegetation can be better and more economically managed through livestock grazing rather than by spraying, mowing,
or burning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth exception is found at proposed &sect;222.7(b)(2)(v) and would allow a permittee who disposes or loses control
of all or part of the base property but retains the permit up to one year, to meet base property requirements. The proposed
rule is very similar to the current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(1)(v) but is reworded to clarify its intent and to recognize
that the loss of control of the base property can result from actions other than disposal through sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.7(b)(3) would grant authorized officers authority to impose additional requirements for term
permits including, but not limited to, nonuse of permits and upper limits on the total number of permitted livestock.
This is a continuation of existing authority currently located in &sect;222.3(c)(1)(vi).

Proposed Section 222.8_Waivers and Escrow Waivers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets out the circumstances where term grazing permits may be waived in favor of another entity, where
escrow waivers may be executed, and the Forest Service role in each. Although escrow waivers have long been allowed
through Forest Service Manual direction, they have not been addressed in the grazing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.8(a) would include provisions for the waiver of term grazing permits to the United States in favor
of another entity. The current rule at &sect;222.3(c)(1)(vi)(F) provides for the establishment of conditions where
waived grazing privileges may be confirmed in favor of a new applicant. The proposed rule at &sect;222.8(a)(1) would
include the current conditions established in the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2230) for waiver of term grazing permits
for National Forest System lands in the Western States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule at &sect;222.8(a)(2) would provide that an existing term grazing permit for National
Forest System lands in the Eastern States, issued under the noncompetitive procedures of 36 CFR 222.53, may be waived
to the United States in favor of the permittee's spouse or child who acquires title to base property or permitted livestock.
If such a permittee dies and the permit was not waived in favor of the spouse or child, the permit reverts to the United
States and would be competitively offered to other applicants pursuant to &sect;222.5(a)(1). This proposed provision
merely placed into the rule what is the current practice in the Eastern States and clarifies the status of the permit
in event of a permittee's death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;222.8(a)(3), the holder of a permit for National Forest System Lands in the Eastern States,
issued as a result of the competitive bidding process authorized in the current rule at 36 CFR 222.54, could not waive
a permit. This provision reflects current Forest Service practice in the Eastern States and is necessary to ensure
continuation of the competitive bidding process at 36 CFR 222.54.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) addresses escrow waivers. The Forest Service has been allowing permittees to execute escrow
waivers in favor of lenders since 1938 under a memorandum of understanding between the Farm Credit Administration
and the Department of Agriculture. That agreement is no longer in effect; however, a new memorandum of understanding
was agreed to by the Forest Service and six western Farm Credit Banks on December 21, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current procedures governing escrow waivers are set forth in FSM Chapter 2230, section 2231.82. Under these procedures,
a permittee who mortgages base property or permitted livestock waives all grazing permit privileges (except the
privilege of continuing to graze livestock) to the United States to be held in escrow for a named lender. If the lender
forecloses on the mortgaged property, the lender or a subsequent purchaser who acquires the foreclosed property
has first priority for receipt of a new term grazing permit. This policy would be incorporated in the rules at &sect;222.8(b).

Proposed Section 222.9_Renewal of Term Grazing permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule specifies the qualifications and priority for reissuance of a term permit. The current
rule at &sect;222.3(c)(1)(vi) merely authorizes the Chief of the Forest Service to prescribe the provisions and
requirements under which term permits will be reissued, but does not set out those provisions in the rule. In the proposed
rule, renewal of term permits is addressed in a separate section to ensure that all provisions related to renewal can
be easily found in one place in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;222.9 states that current permit holders must meet the requirements of &sect;222.7
to qualify for renewal of a term permit, and paragraph (b) provides that current permit holders on National Forest
System lands in the Western States have priority for receiving new term permits when the current permit expires. Under
paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;222.9, a new permit would be issued to the current permit holder if the agency must
cancel an exiting permit to respond to changing law, executive order, regulation, or resource condition. This commitment
to issue a new permit is necessary to protect permittees' interest when events beyond their control result in the need
to establish new terms and conditions of the grazing permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) provides a needed cross reference that notes that holders of expired term permits on the National
Forest System lands in the Eastern States, issued under the competitive bidding process, are subject to the renewal
procedures in 36 CFR part &sect;222, Subpart C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

rule that take into account important rangeland resource management needs.

Documented resource damage refers to damage occurring as a result of the livestock grazing. If permittee-owned livestock
exceed the permitted numbers or are on the allotment at times or in locations not authorized under the permit, they
are considered unauthorized livestock. This change replaces the current excess livestock designation and is consistent
with the current Bureau of Land Management regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.10(b)(1) strengthens direction in the current rule at &sect;222.4(a)(3) by explicitly providing
for a permit to be canceled, suspended, or modified, in whole or in part for failure to pay grazing fees. The proposed
rule includes failure to pay unauthorized use and service charges in the same category.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cancellation of permits for the purpose of reissuance of a new ten year term permit is provided for in both the current
and proposed rules. The current rule &sect;222.3(c)(1)(iii) states that a permit may be cancelled at the end of the
midyear of the decade for reissuance of a new permit. The term grazing permit also currently contains a clause which
states that an authorized officer may cancel the permit at the end of the midyear of the decade so that it may be updated.
The clause provides that, in such a case, a new permit will be reissued to the existing permit holder. This permit clause
causes authorized officers to cancel all the term permits needing updating at the same time and reissue them. This
practice results in inefficiency and delays in reissuing permits. Therefore, paragraph (a)(4) of this section of
the proposed rule retains the authority to cancel permits to update their terms and conditions but does not limit the
point at which this could be done. This charge would allow authorized officers to update permits over a period of time
in an efficient and timely manner. Paragraph (a)(4) also stipulates that when a permit is cancelled under this provision,
issuance of a new permit is preceded by a rangeland project decision and NEPA documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule at &sect;222.4(a)(6) authorizes the Forest Service to cancel or suspend a permit if the permit holder
is convicted of failing to comply with certain Federal laws or regulations or state laws when exercising the grazing
use authorized by the permit. The proposed rule at &sect;222.10(b)(5) would change the words ``when exercising''
to ``related to.'' This proposed change would clarify that the Forest Service is authorized to cancel or suspend a
grazing permit when a permittee is convicted of violating the listed laws even though the violation may have taken
place outside the grazing season or the specific allotment, but there is a connection between the violation and the
grazing use authorized by the permit. The current rule focuses on the permitted grazing allotment and on the permitted
season of use. This clarification is needed so permittees, agency personnel, and the public understand the agency's
intent, to broaden this provision of the rule beyond the grazing allotment and season of use specified in the grazing
permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would incorporate an existing procedure outlined in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration
Handbook, FSH 2209.13, section 16.2, that requires an authorized officer to notify a permittee in writing of an alleged
permit violation and that the officer is considering taking action against the permit. Under &sect;222.10(d) of
the proposed rule, the permittee would be allowed up to 30 days to respond to allegations.

Proposed Section 222.11_Grazing Permit Fees and Other Charges
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a new section of the proposed rule that would direct authorized officers to establish grazing fees and charges
for livestock grazing use in accordance with this section of the proposed rule and the rules in subpart C_Grazing fees
of part 222. Additionally, this section would set out the charges to be assessed for unauthorized use and provide for
the assessment of a service charge for recovery of administrative costs for processing actions related to grazing
permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.11(a) would permit recovery of administrative costs associated with issuance of grazing permits.
Under the current regulations, the Forest Service does not assess a service charge to recover the costs of processing
permit actions initiated by an existing or prospective permittee or processing of actions related to permit violations.
Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, the Forest Service believes it should recover the cost of providing services to users who
seek a special privilege or use, especially when costs of responding to permittees or applicants exceed those normally
incurred by the agency. Paragraph (a) would make clear that the Forest Service is authorized to assess a service change
to recover the administrative and clerical costs for processing those permit actions initiated by an existing permittee
or applicant. Examples of these types of actions are the modification of an existing permit solely at the request and
benefit of the permittee and issuance of a new permit to a qualified applicant. It is estimated that out of the approximately
9,100 permittees on the National Forest System, 2,000 may initiate a permit action in any one year. The average service
charge is estimated to be about $100 per action. It is the agency's intent to issue guidelines to its employees through
the agency directive system establishing the service charge, which would include the processing costs and be adjusted
periodically to reflect any changes in these costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.11(b) makes clear that unauthorized use is a violation of the terms and conditions of the permit
and establishes that authorized officers shall charge permittees and other livestock owners for any unauthorized
use. Charges for unauthorized use are in addition to grazing fees assessed for authorized grazing use as prescribed
in subpart C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.11(c) provides for determining if unauthorized use is willful or nonwillful. If unauthorized
use is determined to be willful, the authorized officer is directed to determine if the offender has been responsible
for other incidents of willful unauthorized use within a period of 36 months preceding the subject incident, and therefore
is subject to the higher rate charge of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;222.11(d) establishes that the charge for unauthorized use will be the average monthly animal unit
month (AUM) grazing fee rate for the 17 Western States published annually by the National Agricultural Statistical
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Direction for determining charges for unauthorized use is covered in the
current rule in subpart C_&sect;222.50(h). Since charges for unauthorized use are penalties rather than fees, this
direction is more appropriately covered under Subpart A of the proposed rule rather than Subpart C where it is currently
located.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;222.11(d)(1) provides that livestock owners responsible for nonwillful unauthorized use would
be charged the unauthorized use rate. This section also provides for the charge to be waived if certain criteria outlined
in the proposed rule are met. In the case of a waiver there would be no unauthorized use or service charges to the permittee
when the situation has been resolved to the satisfaction of the authorized officer. Paragraphs (2) and (3) of proposed
&sect;222.11(d) provide for charging two times the unauthorized use rate for willful unauthorized use and three
times the unauthorized use rate for repeated willful unauthorized use. When unauthorized use is found to be willful,
or repeatedly willful, charges will be assessed for the full cost of all resource and property damage resulting from
the unauthorized use and all reasonable expenses incurred by the United States in detecting, investigating, and
resolving such unauthorized use. In recognition that Forest Service financial penalties have not been effective
as a deterrent in preventing unauthorized use in the past, this section of the proposed rule represents a significant
increase in penalties for unauthorized use. Strong support for this section of the proposed rule was contained in
the public comments on the ANPR. This support was based on the need for Forest Service enforcement of the terms and conditions
of grazing permits and for strong penalties for willful unauthorized use; also, for the recognition that some situations
of unauthorized use are unintentional and the appropriate resolution does not entail a financial penalty.

While this is a new section in the proposed rule describing information requirements associated with the application
and administration of grazing permits, the type of information requested has been routinely collected by the agency
in its grazing permit administration activities for many years. For a description of the information requirements
associated with this rule, see the discussion of ``Information Requirements'' at the end of this ``Supplementary
Information'' section.

Proposed Section 222.13_Improvements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulation at &sect;222.9 authorizes the Forest Service to grant permission to individuals, organizations,
or other agencies to perform range improvement work on National Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service
control. Additionally, the current rule allows authorized officers to require permittees to maintain range improvements
to specified standards. The proposed rule at &sect;222.13 includes the provisions of the current rule but would be
reorganized for ease of use. The only substantive changes embodied in this section is to incorporate provisions related
to the Range Betterment Fund into this section of the proposed rule (currently at &sect;222.10) and to conform the
rules prohibiting adjustment of fees or charges for range improvement work to the new rules governing grazing fees
in the East adopted in 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule at &sect;222.10 details background and direction for range development through the Range Betterment
Fund. Direction presently contained in the current rule at &sect;222.10 has now more appropriately been incorporated
into the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2240). Therefore, direction for use of the Range Betterment Fund in the proposed
rule is greatly reduced from that in the current rule and is incorporated in paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;222.13.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rule at &sect;222.9(d) prohibits adjusting grazing fees or charges for number of head months to compensate
permittees for range improvement work performed on National Forest System lands with the exception of National Grasslands
and land utilization projects. On January 26, 1990, FR 2646, Vol. 55, No. 18, Subpart C of part 222 was amended to allow
grazing fee credits for range improvements on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States to facilitate the
development of ranges. Therefore, the proposed rule at &sect;222.13(d) makes clear where the use of grazing fee credits
or adjustments for rangeland improvement work is authorized within the National Forest System. Proposed paragraph
(d)(1) references the specific sections of Subpart C of part 222 authorizing grazing fee credits for rangeland improvements
on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States. Proposed paragraph (d)(2) continues the provision of the current
rule at &sect;222.9(d) authorizing the adjustment of annual grazing fees on National Grasslands or Land Utilization
Projects to reflect the cost to a grazing permittee of complying with required conservation practices. Proposed
paragraph (d)(3) then specifically states that adjustment in grazing fees charged in exchange for rangeland improvement
work is not authorized on all other National Forest System lands except as provided in proposed paragraphs (d)(2)
and (d)(3).

Proposed Section 222.14_Compensation for Permittees' Interest in Range Improvements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule provides for and sets the conditions under which permittees may be compensated for
investments in existing rangeland improvements in the event of grazing permit cancellation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule at &sect;222.14(a) would incorporate the provisions of the current rule &sect;222.6(a) which
directs that whenever a term permit for grazing livestock on National Forest lands in the 16 contiguous Western States
is cancelled, that the current permittee shall be compensated for the current value of any authorized permanent range
improvements they placed or constructed on the lands. This situation applies when the permit is cancelled, in whole
or in part, to devote the land to another public purpose, including disposal. This provision is applicable only when
lands are actually permanently excluded from grazing and does not apply in the situation when a grazing permit is partially
reduced due to resource conditions but grazing use continues at a reduced level. The value of these range improvements
may not exceed the fair market value of the terminated portion of the permittee(s) interest in the improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions have arisen concerning the status of former permittees and any interest they might have had in a range improvement.
To address these questions, the proposed rule at &sect;222.14 (b) and (c) would state that those permittees who had
waived permits or allowed permits to expire prior to receiving notice of cancellation of grazing in an area would not
be entitled to compensation under this section. This is intended to clarify the direction in the current rule at &sect;222.6(b)
concerning permittees who have waived their permit in connection with the sale of permitted livestock or base property.

Proposed Section 222.15_Recognition and Cooperation With Local Livestock or Grazing Associations and Districts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule deals with the recognition of and subsequent issuance of term permits to local livestock
or grazing associations and the requirements that must be met and adhered to in order to maintain that recognition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 222.7(a) of the current rule authorizes and sets out procedures for Forest Officers to recognize and cooperate
with local livestock associations. Section 222.15 of the proposed rule covers the same information in the current
rule at &sect;222.7(a); however, the text has been edited for clarity and contains two modifications of existing
practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, a clause has been included in term permits which specified that grazing association or district members
must address their grievances to the association or district in accordance with the term permit and the governing
constitution and bylaws of the organization. This requirement should be in the rule. Accordingly, the proposed rule
would include this longstanding grievance process at &sect;222.15(a)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current rule at &sect;222.7(a)(4) allows an authorized officer to withdraw recognition of an association if
it does not hold an annual or special meeting during a 24-month period. However, if an association does not meet at least
once a year, the organization cannot effectively assist in the management of allotment(s), which is the purpose of
the Forest Service cooperating with the association. Therefore, the proposed rule at &sect;222.15(c) would require
an association or district to meet at least once every 12 months. Failure to meet at least annually would be grounds
for withdrawal of recognition. The proposed rule further clarifies that the loss of recognition would result in cancellation
of the grazing permit to the association or district.

Proposed Section 222.16_Cooperation with National, State, and County Livestock Organizations and Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule encourages Forest Service officials to cooperate with national, state, and county
livestock organizations, other agencies, institutions, organizations, and individuals having an interest in
the protection and management of the rangeland resources on National Forest system and private lands. The proposed
rule is very similar to information in the current rule found in &sect;222.7(b), (c), and (d), and &sect;222.8. The
text of these sections of the current rule has been edited for clarity and consolidated into a revised section of the
proposed rule at &sect;222.16. Additionally, &sect;222.11 of the current regulation, providing direction for
the establishment and operation of grazing advisory boards would be removed, as the statutory authority mandating
such boards has expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to editorial changes for clarity, proposed &sect;222.16(b) would make clear that cooperation with other
agencies and units of government is subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Also, the word ``farm'' would
be eliminated from the term ``noxious farm weeds'' in proposed &sect;222.16(b) (1) and (2) to broaden the term to include
undesirable plant species which may occur on rangelands or farm (cultivated) lands. Animal damage management is
added to paragraph (b)(3) as a specific activity in addition to surveillance of pesticide programs for which the Forest
Service cooperates with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority for Grazing Advisory Boards, established under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976,
expired December 31, 1985. Thus, the current regulations at &sect;222.11 concerning Grazing Advisory Boards are
obsolete and need to be removed. However, the proposed rule at &sect;222.16(d) would note that the Secretary has the
authority, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 1), and the implementing regulation at 41 CFR part
101&hyph;6.10, and the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2281, et seq.), to establish advisory boards reflecting
a variety of points of view and resource interests to advise the Forest Service on management of the resources of the
National Forest System including forage production.

Other Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes noted in the preceding section-by-section discussion of the proposed rule, gender specific
references have been identified throughout the current rule and eliminated. Also, wherever possible, the language_but
not the intended meaning_of the existing rule has been revised for clarity and ease of reading; for example, text written
in passive voice has been rewritten in active voice whenever possible. In addition, the organization and arrangement
of the sections of the rule have been revised for easier use by permit holders, agency personnel, and other readers.
Publication of the final rule will require concurrent modifications in the standard conditions and clauses of grazing
permit forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment on this proposed rule, is invited and will be considered in adoption of the final rule. Due to the great
volume of comments anticipated on this proposed rule the Department requests that reviewers identify the specific
section and paragraph label for the regulatory text on which they are commenting. Specific statements of what regulatory
text the reviewer feels should be modified, and the reasons for the recommended changes, are encouraged. By separate
rulemaking, the Department also will propose a revision in the system used to determine the fees for grazing livestock
on National Forest System lands in the Western States.

Regulatory Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review, The agency has
determined that in combination with a separate proposed rule to revise grazing fees this proposed rule is a significant
regulatory action subject to Office of Management and Budget review. The proposed increase in grazing fees may result
in increased operational costs for small ranching businesses that have permits on National Forest System land in
Western States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Interior has prepared an initial Small Entities Flexibility Assessment analyzing the economic
impact of this rulemaking on small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, as a cooperating agency, are preparing a draft environmental
impact statement (DEIS) on rangeland reform as announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 13, 1993. Upon completion of the draft EIS, a notice of availability will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with an opportunity for public comment. Following the comment period on the draft EIS, a final EIS will be developed.

Constitutionally Protected Property Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed for its effects on private property rights (Executive Order 12630 of March 15, 1988, ``Government
Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights'' as implemented by the U.S. Attorneys
General's Guidelines for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings). Under the Guidelines,
benefits and privileges bestowed by the Government are expressly excluded from the definition of private property
rights protected by the Fifth Amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress established that a grazing permit is a privilege through the Granger-Thye Act of April 24, 1950 (Section
19) and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (Section 402h)). Both of these acts state that
the issuance of grazing permits in no way grants any right, title, interest, or estate in or to lands or resources held
by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A long line of court cases has established that a grazing permit is a noncompensable interest since it is a privilege
to use federally owned land for livestock grazing purposes. Accordingly, it is a privilege_not a right_which can
be withdrawn or canceled by the United States without compensation. Since this rule deals with granting a privilege,
Executive Order 12630, which involves the taking of private property for public use, does not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the above, the Office of General Counsel has prepared a Taking Implication Assessment on grazing
activities undertaken by the Forest Service. It was the conclusion of that assessment that regulatory activities
associated with Forest Service administration of grazing on National Forest System lands do not present the risk
of a taking of private property.

Information Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule governing grazing and livestock use on National Forest System lands specifies the information
that applicants or permittees must provide in order for an authorized officer to act on a request. This proposed rule
would not require permittees to provide any additional information from that already required under the existing
rule. As such, this rule contains information requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following Forest Service grazing-related forms: FS 2200&hyph;1, Refund, Credit, or Transfer Application;
FS 2200&hyph;2, Application for Temporary Grazing Permit)_Part 1; FS 2200&hyph;12, Waiver of Term Grazing Permit;
FS 2200&hyph;13, Escrow Waiver of Term Grazing Permit Privileges; FS 2200&hyph;16, Application for Term Grazing
Permit; and FS 2200&hyph;17, Application for Term Private Land Grazing Permit are already cleared for the use that
would be required by this proposed rule and have been assigned OMB control No. 0596&hyph;0003, with an expiration
date of August 31, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burdens for the collection of information by these forms is estimated to average from 9 to 18 minutes
per response depending on the form. Extremely complex situations may require up to 2 hours to prepare. The information
needed to complete the forms should be readily available from existing livestock and landownership records. Reviewers
should send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including
suggestions for reduction this burden to: Chief (2200) Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6090;
and Forest Service Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503.

Civil Justice Reform Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule were
adopted, (1) all state and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this proposed rule or which would impede
its full implementation would be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect would be given to this proposed rule; and (3)
it would not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging its provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Framework for rangeland planning and decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Forest plan direction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Planning for management of rangelands is accomplished through the land and resource management planning process
set out in 36 CFR part 219. Forest plans establish programmatic direction including goals, objectives, standards,
and guidelines for rangeland management and identify National Forest System lands suitable for livestock grazing.
A suitability determination is not a decision to authorize grazing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rangeland project decisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as otherwise provided in this section, a rangeland project decision is required when site-specific activities
designed to accomplish a specific, on-the-ground purpose or result are proposed which implements the programmatic
management direction in the forest plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Examples of rangeland project decisions include, but are not limited to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Maintenance or modification of specific plant communities or riparian, aquatic, soil, or other resource conditions
needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Rangeland improvements needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Authorization of livestock grazing where grazing is suitable and appropriate. A rangeland project decision
authorizing livestock grazing must specify the maximum permissible amount of grazing use, the timing and duration
of such use, and other appropriate livestock management requirements or measures needed to promote the achievement
of goals and objectives of the forest plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rangeland project decisions must be consistent with applicable forest plan standards and guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rangeland project decisions are decision points subject to NEPA procedures. Where a rangeland project decision
authorizes livestock grazing, timely issuance of the grazing permit based on the rangeland project decision is an
administrative act and not a separate decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transitional procedures for authorizing grazing use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the absence of a rangeland project decision that addresses livestock grazing use, the authorized officer may issue
a grazing permit in accordance with the following transitional procedures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The authorized officer may issue a new term permit for up to ten years where there is a current allotment management
plan adopted prior to [180 days from date of publication of the final rule] and the analysis and disclosure of environmental
effects are still current.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On those allotments for which there is no current allotment management plan but which are meeting, or moving toward
achievement of, forest plan goals and objectives, the authorized officer may issue a new term permit for up to ten years
based on the forest plan, provided that the plan contains applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated
as terms and conditions of the permit and that the environmental effects of applying the standards and guidelines
on the land are analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On those allotments for which there is no allotment management plan or current NEPA disclosure and the allotments
are meeting, or moving toward achievement of, forest plan goals and objectives, but the forest plan does not contain
applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated into the permit, the authorized officer shall issue
a term permit not exceeding three years in duration to authorize the continuation of grazing. This interim period
will permit the agency to gather information and conduct necessary analysis to determine if grazing should be authorized
or a different permit term should be established. In such cases, the environmental effects of continuing grazing
under a 1&hyph;3 year term permit must be analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures prior to issuance of the
permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On those allotments for which there is no allotment management plan or current NEPA disclosure, and the allotments
are not meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives, the authorized officer may not issue
a term permit of more than three years in duration until a rangeland project decision and disclosure of environmental
effects is accomplished. In the interim, the authorized officer may issue a term permit of up to three years in duration
provided that the terms and conditions of the permit include existing or amended forest plan standards and guidelines
or other measures necessary to move management of the allotment toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives.
In such case, the environmental effects of continuing grazing under the 1&hyph;3 year term permit must be analyzed
and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures prior to issuance of the permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Where authorization of livestock grazing is made pursuant to paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section,
the authorized officer shall develop and maintain a schedule for completing rangeland project decisions and site
specific disclosure of environmental effects on affected allotments pursuant to NEPA procedures. The authorized
officer shall develop this schedule in consultation with the grazing permittees and other interested parties. Priority
for scheduling the completion of rangeland project decisions shall be given to those areas with significant resource
concerns such as protection of threatened and endangered species, riparian and aquatic habitats, and water quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where grazing permits are issued under the transitional procedures of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of
this section, the timely issuance of a grazing permit is an administrative act and not a separate decision.

Grazing authorization required. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All livestock grazing use of National Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service control requires prior
written authorization through a grazing permit issued by an authorized officer, except for certain temporary grazing
as provided for in &sect;222.6(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nature of grazing permit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A grazing permit is a privilege authorizing the holder to use National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest
Service control subject to the terms and conditions contained therein. Grazing permits do not convey any right, title,
or interest in United States lands, resources, or permanent range improvements to the permittee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NEPA compliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issuance of a permit implements a previous decision to authorize grazing and is not a decision point subject to NEPA
procedures as provided for in &sect;222.3(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terms and conditions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The authorized officer shall prescribe the terms and conditions of each grazing permit in accordance with applicable
statutes, regulations, and direction issued through the Forest Service Directive System (36 CFR 200.4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The authorized officer shall include as terms and conditions of the grazing permit those applicable standards
and guidelines in the forest plan and rangeland project decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A permittee may be required, as a condition of permit issuance, to collect and submit to the Forest Service monitoring,
inventory, or other resource information related to the permitted livestock grazing activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operating instructions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the terms and conditions of a permit, the authorized officer may issue written operating instructions
to the permittee(s) to make annual, seasonal, or other temporary adjustments in the amount or duration of livestock
grazing use authorized by a grazing permit. The authorized officer may also issue written instructions that temporarily
adjust or tailor terms and conditions as necessary for proper management of the rangelands. As long as the operating
instructions fall within the scope of the decision authorizing the grazing use and the NEPA documentation associated
with that decision, this does not require a new decision and additional environmental analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following types of grazing permits may be issued to applicants that meet the relevant requirements of &sect;222.7
for a term of up to 10 years with priority for renewal, as described in &sect;222.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A term grazing permit may be issued to qualified applicants, including grazing associations and districts, to
graze livestock on National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control. On all National Forest
System lands in the Eastern States, except the National Grasslands in Texas and Oklahoma, permits for new allotments
or permits that are vacated or terminated are issued under the competitive provision of &sect;222.54.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A term private land grazing permit may be issued to a qualified applicant who owns or controls land in an allotment
under Forest Service control. To receive this permit, the applicant must waive exclusive grazing use of the private
land involved to the United States for the full period the permit is to be issued. In return, the applicant is authorized
to graze livestock within the allotment associated with the waived private land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A term grazing permit with provisions for grazing on and off National Forest System lands and other lands under
Forest Service control may be issued to a qualified applicant when a logical grazing area contains both lands under
Forest Service administration and lands controlled by the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A grazing agreement may be issued to eligible grazing associations or districts, to graze livestock on National
Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service control. Under such grazing agreements, grazing associations
or districts may be authorized to issue and administer grazing permits subject to rules, policies, and procedures
agreed to by the authorized officer.

SUMMARY:

This proposed rule would change the system used to determine the fees for grazing livestock on National Forest System
land in the Western States. These changes are needed to obtain a fair and reasonable return to the United States for
the privilege of grazing privately owned livestock on public rangelands administered by the Forest Service. The
proposed change in the fee considered the impact on the economic viability of the western livestock industry. By separate
rulemaking, the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior, is proposing a similar system for determining
the fee for grazing livestock on lands administered by that agency. Also by separate rulemaking published elsewhere
in this separate part of the

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule to revise the grazing fee system is a part of the ``Rangeland Reform '94'' effort by the Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to insure a fair and reasonable return for grazing privately owned livestock
on public rangelands. The impact of a higher fee on the livestock industry was considered. The two agencies are proposing
to use the same grazing fee system; however, each agency must prepare a separate proposed rule that reflects the differences
in statutory authority that apply to each agency. On August 13, 1993, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior
published Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRs) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 43202; 43208), in which each Department gave notice of its intent to revise its livestock grazing and grazing
fee rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on both ANPRs ended September 13, 1993, and was subsequently reopened for an additional 30-day
period that ended October 20, 1993. A total of about 12,600 letters were received on the ANPRs. These letters included
over 56,000 individual comments on various aspects of grazing administration and fees. The greatest number of comments
addressed possible changes in the grazing fee. In response to the public comment, the Department of Agriculture has
decided to separate the grazing fee system proposal from the rangeland management proposal. Comments on the grazing
fee system portion of the ANPR will be considered in the development of the final grazing fee rule. Reviewers need not
resubmit comments they filed on the Department of Agriculture's ANPR in order for them to be considered by the agency
in the preparation of the final rule.

Proposed Revisions to 36 CFR Part 222, Subpart C
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed grazing fee system embodied in this proposed rule is intended to correct the disparity between rates
charged for livestock forage on private and Federal lands. An explanation of proposed amendments to the existing
grazing fee regulations at 36 CFR part 222, subpart C, follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposed rule establishes guidelines for administering the grazing fee system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 222.50(a) of the proposed rule is a revision of the current rule to simplify general administrative instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies the determination of grazing fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) retains the current definition of head month with some minor editing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) would continue the proviso that there would be no charge for lambing on National Forest System
land for sheep already authorized under a grazing permit; however, the text is edited for clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e) consolidates under a single provision of the rule, the fees charged for livestock use under
temporary grazing permits. This change would simplify the administration of grazing fees and would specify that
the authorized officer may adjust, up or down, the fees for temporary grazing permits to meet management objectives
of the forest land and resource management plan and grazing permit terms and conditions.

Paragraph (f) of the current rule would be removed because fees for trailing livestock would be included in proposed

Paragraph (g) of the current rule would be redesignated as paragraph (f) in the proposed rule and remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) of the current rule would be removed because charges for unauthorized use are not part of the grazing
fee system, but are penalties that are more appropriately addressed in the proposed revision of the rules in subpart
A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (i) and (j) would be redesignated as paragraphs (g) and (h) and retained without change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (k) of the current rule would be removed because it describes beef cattle price data that would not be used

Section 222.51_Grazing Fees in the Western States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Section 222.51 would be revised in its entirety. The heading would be revised to read: Grazing fees in the Western
States. This revision proposes a new system for determining grazing fees which would be implemented in 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The areas subject to the new fee system would be revised to include all of the national grasslands. Historically, the
national grasslands have been subject to a different fee system than the one used for national forests. In 1992, the
Secretary of Agriculture reduced the national grasslands grazing fee to an amount commensurate with the national
forest grazing fee. The proposed rule would incorporate this change so that the grazing fee on national grasslands
would be the same as the fee charged for livestock grazing on other National Forest System lands in the Western States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting a revised fee system, the Forest Service and BLM established several criteria that a proposed fee system
should meet. Those criteria are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The fee charged for livestock grazing should approximate market value. Using the market value helps assure that
the public receives a fair return for the private use of publicly owned resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The fee charged should not cause unreasonable impacts on livestock operations that are heavily dependent on public
forage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The fee charged should recover a reasonable amount of the government's cost involved in administering grazing
permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The fee charged should provide increased funds to improve rangeland resource conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The fee system should be understandable and relatively inexpensive to administer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present fee system, in effect since 1978, has been criticized for contributing to the wide disparity between charges
for livestock grazing on private lands compared to charges for livestock grazing on Federal lands. While the forage
value in the private market has increased substantially over time, the Federal grazing fee has decreased during some
seasons or had relatively small increases. The proposed grazing fee system would address the failure of the existing
grazing fee system to adequately reflect private grazing land market conditions. The proposed fee system would include
a base value which considers the cost differences of operating on public lands as compared to private lands, as well
as appraisal data, annually adjusting the fee in proportion to changes in private grazing land lease rates (PGLLR).
After an initial phase-in period, the fee would be adjusted annually by multiplying the base value by the forage value
index (FVI), which reflects the change in PGLLR for the 17 Western States, using the weighted average AUM price in each
State. The PGLLR estimate is prepared annually by the USDA, National Agricultural Statistical Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the public input gained following the ANPR and through the scoping process for the environmental analysis
of ``Rangeland Reform '94'', the Departments of Agriculture and Interior determined that the grazing fee system
proposed initially represents a reasonable and equitable method for calculating the fee. However, change in FVI
is proposed and a provision for incentive-based fee adjustment has been added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed fee would be phased in over the years 1995 through 1997. Thereafter, annual increases or decreases in
the grazing fee resulting from changes in the FVI would be limited to 25 percent of the amount charged the previous year
to minimize impact of fee increases on ranch operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A base value of $3.96 per animal unit month (AUM) is proposed in this rule. This value represents the average of the results
obtained through the use of two methods discussed below for estimating a fair base value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first method is the 1966 Western Livestock Grazing Survey (WLGS), where over 10,000 individuals were interviewed
to determine the costs of operating on federal lands and the relationship of public land grazing use to the PGLLR. The
WLGS determined the 1966 11-State value for grazing federal lands to be $1.23 per AUM. This value is updated to a 1991
AUM base value of $3.25, which is determined by multiplying $1.23 by 265, the percentage change in the PGLLR from the
base years 1964&hyph;1968, and dividing by 100.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second method for estimating a fair base value comes from the 1983 Grazing Market Rental Appraisal (GMRA) on BLM
and Forest Service lands. The GMRA involved interviews with approximately 100,000 people and generated 7,246 records
for researching livestock grazing operation costs and fees. The GMRA divided the 16 Western States into 6 pricing
regions and concluded that the value of public land grazing use ranged from $4.68 per head month in the southwest pricing
region to $8.55 per head month in the northern plains pricing region. In 1992, the GMRA was updated. The update identified
values ranging from $4.68 per head month in the southwest pricing region to $10.26 per head month in the northern plains
pricing region. The $4.68 value was selected for the second base value. It was considered to have the least impact on
the permittee's livestock grazing operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FVI will be used to make adjustments each year to the base value. Production costs, and the value of the livestock
produced, influence the prices paid for grazing livestock on private lands and, thus, are implicit in the FVI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would establish 1996 as the base year for the FVI. The FVI would not be used to annually adjust the
fee in response to market conditions until the year 1997. This proposed rule would establish the 1995 grazing fee at
$2.75, and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter, the fee would be calculated using the base value of $3.96 multiplied
by the revised FVI. By definition, the FVI in the year 1997 would equal one; yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent
years, the calculated fee would depend on changes in the FVI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed fee system presented in the ANPR, the fee would have been adjusted annually by a FVI based on the average
price paid for private grazing in the years 1990 through 1992. Assuming that the FVI would have remained constant until
the end of the phase-in period provided in the ANPR, the grazing fee system would have yielded a fee of $4.28 as compared
to a 1997 fee of $3.96 using the revised FVI. This change in the derivation of the FVI is proposed in order to reduce the
uncertainty in fee changes in the immediate future that might result from using a FVI based on less current PGLLR data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the 3-year phase-in, the grazing fee would be allowed to change by no more than 25 percent annually, plus or minus,
from the amount charged the previous year. The 3-year phase-in and the 25 percent per year limit are designed to minimize
impact of fee increases on ranch operations. By comparison, the 1994 grazing fee established under the existing regulations
is $1.98.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the intent of the two Departments to develop a system for earning incentives that may be used to promote rangeland
reform. New provisions have been added to the proposed rule that would provide for an incentive-based grazing fee
and would prohibit implementation of the $3.96 base value until such time as a separate regulation is issued which
sets forth the qualification criteria for the incentive-based grazing fee. These criteria would focus primarily
upon those permittees and lessees who agree to participate in special rangeland improvement programs characterized
by best management practices, the furtherance of resource condition objectives, and comprehensive monitoring.
However, the proposed rule does explain that, upon issuance of the separate rule establishing qualification criteria
and upon demonstrating compliance with said criteria, a permittee would be eligible for a 30 percent reduction of
his or her grazing fee. The Departments intend to use its best efforts to issue a final rule establishing qualification
criteria in time to provide an opportunity for the reduced fee in grazing year 1996. A 30 percent discount would result
in a grazing fee of $2.77 in 1996 and 1997 for qualifying permittees and lessees. To ensure timely development of the
rule establishing criteria for the incentive-based grazing fee, this proposed rule would provide that the base value
shall remain at $3.50 and would not increase until that rule is adopted. Reviewers are asked to provide suggested criteria
for qualifying for the reduced fee that address the improvement and maintenance of rangeland health.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 222.52 of the current rule would be revised in its entirety. The heading would be revised to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grasslands Fee Adjustments for Conservation Practices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This new section would place into regulation a program based on the accumulation of conservation practice credits
for sound conservation practice used by a permittee on national grasslands. Since the 1950's, the Forest Service
has allowed credit, applied to grazing fee billings, for required conservation practices and administrative activities
performed by grazing associations on the national grasslands. Allowing credit for required conservation practices
is authorized by section 32(c), title III, Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937. This policy has previously been
issued as agency directives to Title 2200 of the Forest Service Manual. The agency believes these provisions are more
appropriate in regulation than in directive form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of credit for required conservation practices on the national grasslands is similar to the use of range betterment
funds used on National Forest System in the 16 contiguous Western States for implementing rangeland improvement
activities. The range betterment fund is not authorized for national grasslands. In the case of the national grasslands,
the costs to the permit holders of performing conservation practices required by the Forest Service would be subtracted
before the Forest Service collects the grazing fee from the permittee. In addition, provision is made for giving credit
for administrative costs that would otherwise be a cost to the Forest Service. For example, the cost to a grazing association
of issuing individual permits and monitoring the number of grazing livestock could be credited against the fees charged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently the grazing fees in the Eastern States do not apply to National Forest System land in Oklahoma or national
grassland in Texas. As previously noted, under the grazing fee system proposed by this rulemaking, all national grasslands
would be subject to the same grazing fee as that applicable to western national forests. Therefore, it is necessary
to make a conforming amendment to paragraph (a) in both &sect;222.53 and &sect;222.54 to clarify that the grazing
fee system applicable in the East would not apply to grazing on the national grasslands in Oklahoma and Texas but would
apply to grazing on national forest land in Oklahoma and Texas, which are administered as part of the Southern Region
of the Forest Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, terms referring to the process of allotment management planning have been replaced by terms
specifying grazing permit terms and conditions. These changes in terminology would coincide with proposed changes
in rangeland management plans. Several other editorial changes are proposed in this section to clarify permit procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grazing fee system that would be implemented if this proposed rule is adopted would result in an increase in fees
charged for grazing livestock on public rangelands. This proposed rule would establish the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75,
and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter, the fee would be calculated using the base value of $3.96, multiplied
by the revised forage value index yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent years, the calculated fee would
depend on the changes in the market rate for private grazing land leases. After the 3-year phase-in, the grazing fee
would change no more than 25 percent annually, plus or minus, from the amount charged the previous year. Preparation
of a separate rule establishing an incentive-based grazing fee is underway. As currently contemplated, permittees
could be entitled to a 30 percent reduction in their grazing fees using the $3.96 base value if they meet certain qualification
criteria, the identification of which will be the focus of this separate rulemaking. Pending adoption of this separate
rule, the base value shall remain at $3.50 for the purposes of calculating the fee. The proposed fee system would apply
to all National Forest System lands in the Western States. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption
of the final rule.

This rule has been reviewed for its effects on private property rights (Executive Order 12630 of March 15, 1988, ``Government
Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights'' as implemented by the U.S. Attorneys
General's Guidelines for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings). Under the Guidelines,
benefits, and privileges bestowed by the Government are expressly excluded from the definition of private property
rights protected by the Fifth Amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress established that a grazing permit is a privilege through the Granger-Thye Act of April 24, 1950 (Section
19), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (Section 402(h)). Both of these acts state that
the issuance of grazing permits in no way grants any right, title, interest, or estate in or to lands or resources held
by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A long line of court cases has established that a grazing permit is a noncompensable interest since it is a privilege
to use federally owned land for livestock grazing purposes. Accordingly, it is a privilege_not a right-which can
be withdrawn or canceled by the United States without compensation. Since this rule deals with granting a privilege,
Executive Order 12630, which involves the taking of private property for public use, does not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the above, the Office of General Counsel has prepared a Takings Implication Assessment (TIA) on
grazing activities undertaken by the Forest Service. The TIA concluded that regulatory activities associated with
Forest Service administration of grazing on National Forest System lands do not present the risk of a taking of private
property.

(a) Fees shall be charged for all livestock grazing of National Forest System land or other land under Forest Service
control, unless otherwise expressly provided in the grazing permit terms and conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In calculating fees, the agency shall not consider any value associated with a grazing permit that may be capitalized
into the permit holder's private ranching operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For billing purposes, the grazing fee charged is for each head month of livestock grazing. The fee is prorated on
a daily basis and is multiplied by the number of head months of use and the number of days. For purposes of calculating
grazing fees, a head month is a month's use and occupancy of rangeland by one adult cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse or
mule, five sheep, or five goats. An animal is an adult if it is weaned, is at least 6 months old at the beginning of the permitted
period of use, or will be 12 months old during the permitted period of use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When sheep grazing is already authorized by a grazing permit, no additional charge shall be made for lambing upon
National Forest System land or other lands under Forest Service management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The grazing fee established in &sect;&sect;222.51, 222.53, and 222.54 may be charged for all livestock grazing
of National Forest System land authorized by a temporary grazing permit. However, the authorized officer may waive
or otherwise adjust the fee when the Forest Service imposes limitations or requirements on grazing use for the purpose
of implementing management objectives in the forest land resource management plan and the terms and conditions of
the grazing permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) All fees charged for livestock grazing of National Forest System land are payable in advance of the opening date
of the grazing period, or entry, unless otherwise authorized by the Chief of the Forest Service and provided for in
the grazing permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions and circumstances as the Chief of the Forest Service
may specify.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (i) of this section, the annual fee for livestock grazing under paragraph
(a) above is determined by a base value of $3.96 which is multiplied by the forage value index (FVI) or grazing fee = base
value &times; FVI. The FVI is the change in private grazing land lease rate (PGLLR) of the 17 Western States weighted
average AUM price in each state. The PGLLR estimate is prepared annually by USDA, National Agricultural Statistics
Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The base value shall be $3.96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The base year used for computing the FVI shall be 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The grazing fee shall be phased in over a three-year period, computed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fee for 1995 will be ($2.75).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The fee for 1996 will be ($3.50).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Starting with the year 1997 and, thereafter, the annual fee shall be computed, as specified in paragraph (b) of
this section, using $3.96 times the FVI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Any annual increase or decrease in the grazing fee occurring in the year after 1997, and thereafter, shall be limited
to not more than 25 percent from the fee charged the previous year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Starting with the year 1996, permittees will be eligible for an incentive-based grazing fee that would reduce
fees by 30 percent of the value specified in paragraph (c) of this section based on a demonstrated compliance with certain
qualification criteria. The incentive-based grazing fee for 1996 = $3.96 &times; 0.70. The incentive-based grazing
fee for 1997 and thereafter = $3.96 &times; FVI &times; 0.70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the base value in 1997 and, thereafter, will be $3.50 until such

 Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an
agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credit for such improvements to be applied toward the annual
grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual
permittee, through the terms and conditions of the grazing permit, to construct or develop on a specific allotment
to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan. Improvements
eligible for fee credits involve only costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit,
are of tangible public benefit, and enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity,
riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. The cost of
maintaining range improvements specified in the terms and conditions of the grazing permit and other costs incurred
by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.

Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an
agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual
grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual
permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the
relevant forest land and resource management plan through the terms and conditions of the grazing permit. These improvements
must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public
benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed,
and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habit, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements
specified in the terms and conditions of the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary
course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
