SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its practices and procedures to allow administrative judges to retain
jurisdiction over cases after the issuance of an initial decision for the purpose of vacating the initial decision
to accept a settlement agreement into the record. This change will allow the parties to enter into the record a settlement
agreement reached after the issuance of the initial decision without filing a petition for review with the full Board.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended regulation provides administrative judges the authority to accept settlement agreements into the record
after the issuance of the initial decision but before full Board consideration. This allows the parties to enter into
the record a settlement agreement reached after the issuance of the initial decision without filing a petition for
review thus facilitating the settlement of cases. This amendment does not change the current time limits prescribed
in 5 CFR 1201.113 for determining the finality of a Board decision or for filing a petition for review.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model
BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker 1000 series airplanes. This action requires inspections of the thrust reverser system
for integrity, and correction of any discrepancy found. This amendment is prompted by a report that there is a possibility
of failure of the drive links (or attachments) on the thrust reversers of these airplanes due to the single link design
concept of the thrust reverser link and lock system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent
deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a significant
reduction in the controllability of the airplane due to an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A and Hawker
1000 series airplanes. The CAA advises that the manufacturer of the thrust reversers on these airplanes has conducted
a reassessment of the failure modes and effects analysis for the thrust reverser system, and has provided to the airplane
manufacturer additional recommendations for repetitive inspection intervals of the system. Results of that reassessment
revealed that failure of the drive links (or attachments) on the thrust reversers can occur due to the single link design
concept of the thrust reverser link and lock system. This condition, if not corrected, can result in inadvertent deployment
of a thrust reverser during flight, which could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., has issued Service Bulletin SB 78&hyph;12, dated January 24, 1994, that describes
procedures for a detailed visual inspection of the thrust reverser drive mechanism to detect wear and abrasion and
to ensure the security of the attachment of the actuator to its drive links, of the drive links to the thrust reverser
structure, and of the ends of the drive link and link hinges. The service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive
inspections of the thrust reverser system for structural integrity. Accomplishment of these inspections will ensure
the continued structural integrity of the thrust reverser system. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight
and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the thrust reverser
system for integrity, and correction of any discrepancy found. The inspections are required to be accomplished in
accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Correction of any discrepancy found is required to be
accomplished in accordance with procedures described in the airplane maintenance manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered interim action. The airplane manufacturer currently is developing a secondary locking feature
on the thrust reverser doors. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider
further rulemaking to require its installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;33&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain SAAB Model SAAB SF340A and
SAAB 340B airplanes. This action requires installation of a placard in the cockpit that informs the flight crew of
the prohibition against moving the power levers below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) when the airplane is airborne.
This amendment is prompted by an incident during which a Model SAAB 340B airplane, that was in ``beta mode'' for a short
duration during descent, lost all engine power. The action specified in this AD is intended to prevent engine overspeed
and the resultant loss of engine power.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA has received a report that a SAAB Model SAAB 340B airplane lost all engine power during descent. In
this incident, the flight crew managed to land the airplane with no turbine power. However, the airplane ran off the
end of the runway and sustained damage in the process. The flight data recorder from this airplane revealed that the
power levers were set below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) for approximately eight seconds during the airplane's descent
from 9,200 feet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altitude. Further, the FAA has received reports of other incidents in which operators of Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB
340B airplanes have selected ``beta mode'' either inadvertently or intentionally during flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that if the flight crew moves the power levels below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) when the airplane
is airborne, the propeller will go into a low pitch angle and the propeller speed may increase uncontrollably. This
condition, if not corrected, could result in engine overspeed and the resultant loss of engine power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAAB Aircraft has issued Service Bulletin 340&hyph;76&hyph;033, dated March 31, 1994, that describes procedures
for installation of a placard in the cockpit of certain Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. The placard informs
the flight crew of the prohibition against moving the power levers below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) when the airplane
is airborne. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These airplane models are manufactured in Sweden and are type certificated for operation in the United States under
the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. The FAA has reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products
of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent engine overspeed and the resultant loss
of engine power. This AD requires installation of a placard in the cockpit of certain SAAB Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB
340B airplanes. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received.
Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the
effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;46&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the
Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes Restricted Area R&hyph;6707, Queets, WA. An
FAA review of the annual utilization reports revealed that this area received limited use in the past year. After reviewing
its operational requirements, the Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to disestablish the area. This action
returns restricted airspace to public use; therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)
are unnecessary because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested.
Section 73.67 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

the recreational vessel fee (RVF) for calendar years 1993 and 1994, as required by the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries
Enforcement Act of 1992. This final rule also removes Lake Roosevelt, WA, from the listing of specific waters where
the Coast Guard has a presence.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 17, 1993, the Coast Guard published an interim final rule entitled ``Recreational Vessel Fees'' in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 8884). The rule was made effective on October 1, 1992, to coincide with the effective date of the statutory revisions
in section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;582). A delay in amending
the existing regulations could have resulted in vessel owners or operators paying a fee which was no longer required.
The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the interim final rule; it supported the announced phaseout of the
fees. No public hearing was requested and none was held. On March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12549), the Coast Guard published a
technical amendment to restore text in the CFR mistakenly removed by the interim final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 2110 of title 46, United States Code, to require the
Secretary of Transportation to establish a fee or charge for recreational vessels and to collect it annually in fiscal
years (FY) 1991 through 1995 from the vessel owner or operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, enacted October 16, 1992, amends 46 U.S.C. 2110(b)(1)
to limit collection of the annual fee to fiscal years 1993 and 1994, to reduce the number of recreational vessels subject
to the annual fee by limiting the vessel length categories partially in fiscal year 1993 and even more in 1994, and to
rescind the fee in fiscal year 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule adopts the interim final rule, as corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also removes Lake Roosevelt (WA) as a specific body of water on which the fee applies. Lake Roosevelt (WA)
was originally listed in &sect;1.30&hyph;1(e) due to an actual Coast Guard presence for maintaining aids to navigation.
The Coast Guard entered into a memorandum of agreement transferring maintenance of the aids to navigation on Lake
Washington to the National Park Service in January 1993. With this transfer, the Coast Guard no longer has an actual
presence on Lake Roosevelt and the fees should no longer apply on the Lake. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective
in less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest to relieve
owners or operators of vessels on Lake Washington no longer subject to the fees from unnecessarily paying the fees.

Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26,1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rulemaking to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.

Small Entities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of rulemaking
is required. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). Since this rule applies only to recreational vessels, the Coast Guard has determined that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
to revise the definitions for historically black colleges (HBCUs) and universities and minority institutions (MIs).
The rule also revises the requirement for an offeror to qualify as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI both at
time of submission of the offer and at time of award by eliminating the requirement to qualify at time of award.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsections 811(a) and (b), of the FY 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160) revise the definitions
for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI) in 10 U.S.C. 2323(a)(1)(B)
and (C). Subsection 811(c) eliminates the requirement for an entity that is seeking a DoD contract and represents
itself as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI to maintain its status as such entity at the time of award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94&hyph;06, April 21, 1994, to implement Subsections
811(a), (b) and (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sole purpose of this rule is to implement statutory revisions. The impact, if any, would benefit small entities,
because the requirement for retaining status as a small disadvantaged business, historically black college or university,
or minority institution, at time of award is deleted. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS
subparts will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS
Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect
information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule.
Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment.
This action is necessary because Subsections 811(a), (b), and (c) became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year
1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160), on November 30, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577
and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered
in formulating the final rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to advise persons who transport or offer for transportation certain hazardous materials
of an annual requirement to register with the Department of Transportation. A Final Rule implementing this requirement
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 9, 1992 (57 FR 30620&hyph;30633), a clarification on July 28, 1992 (57 FR 33416&hyph;33417), editorial revisions
on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 37900&hyph;37902), a formal interpretation of the terms ``offeror'' and ``transporter''
on October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48739&hyph;48741), and an amendment to the regulation on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12543&hyph;12545).
Each person, as defined by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, who engages in any of the specified activities
relating to the transportation of hazardous materials is required to register annually with the Department of Transportation
and pay a fee. Proceeds are used to fund grants to State, local, and Indian tribal governments for emergency response
planning and training. The regulations implementing this program are in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections
107.601&hyph;107.620.

RSPA is now accepting 1994&hyph;95 registrations. The Registration Statement has not been revised for the 1994&hyph;95
Registration Year. Registrants should file a registration statement and pay the associated fee in advance of July
1, 1994, in order to ensure that a 1994&hyph;95 Registration Number has been provided by that date to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements, including the requirement that the number be made available on board each truck and
truck tractor (not including trailers and semi-trailers) used to transport hazardous materials subject to the registration
requirements. A Certificate of Registration is generally mailed within three weeks of RSPA's receipt of a Registration
Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who engage in any of the specified activities during a Registration Year are required to register for that
year. Persons who engaged in these activities during Registration Year 1992&hyph;93 (September 16, 1992, through
June 30, 1993) or 1993&hyph;94 (July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994) and have not filed a registration statement and
paid the associated fee of $300.00 for each year for which registration is required should contact RSPA to obtain the
required form (DOT F 5800.2). Persons who fail to register for any registration year in which they engaged in such activities
are subject to civil penalties for each day a covered function is performed. The legal obligation to register for a
year in which any of the specified activities was conducted does not end with the registration year. Registration
after the completion of a registration year may also involve the imposition of a late fee and interest in addition to
a civil penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1994&hyph;95 Registration Year, RSPA has entered into an agreement with the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio (PUCO) to test an alternative procedure for filing the Federal Registration Statement for motor carriers
who are also subject to the State of Ohio's registration program. Ohio Revised Code Section 4905.80 requires that
motor carriers transporting in or through Ohio hazardous materials that must be placarded, require the display of
vehicle markings, or must be manifested register with PUCO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motor carriers who are subject to the Federal 1994&hyph;95 Hazardous Materials Registration requirement, may elect
to submit a completed Federal Registration Statement DOT Form F 5800.2, through PUCO together with the associated
fee of $300.00 payable to the U.S. Department of Transportation. This option for the submittal of the Federal registration
documents through PUCO is being offered to certain motor carriers to demonstrate if this procedure is more cost-effective
or otherwise less burdensome to industry and government. Since this procedure is optional, a motor carrier subject
to Ohio's registration requirement may elect to register in the Federal program directly with the U.S. Department
of Transportation, as specified in 49 CFR 107.616. However, PUCO has agreed to verify that all motor carriers required
to register with PUCO are registered with DOT if they are subject to the Federal registration requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A motor carrier subject to both the Federal and PUCO registration requirements who elects to register in the Federal
program through PUCO may obtain the required Federal and Ohio forms and related information by contacting the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio, Transportation Department, Hazardous Materials Division, 180 East Broad Street,
5th Floor, Columbus, OH 43215&hyph;3793, telephone 614&hyph;466&hyph;7232.

On April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15602&hyph;15605), RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which it proposed several
additional requirements that may affect persons currently subject to the registration requirements. New provisions
proposed in this notice include: (1) A requirement that shippers verify that carriers are registered before using
their services and that carriers verify that shippers are registered before accepting a shipment from them; (2) a
requirement that vessel operators carry proof of registration on each vessel subject to the registration requirement;
and (3) a two-year extension (until July 1, 1996) in the delay in implementation of the registration requirement for
foreign offerors of hazardous materials. Persons subject to the registration requirements are advised to watch
for further developments in this rulemaking action.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the
BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish
fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620, 672, and 675.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments 13 and 18 to the groundfish FMPs for the BSAI and GOA, respectively, authorize a comprehensive domestic
fishery observer program. An Observer Plan to implement the program was prepared by the Secretary in consultation
with the Council and issued by NMFS, effective February 7, 1990 (55 FR 4839, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 12, 1990). At its December 1992 meeting, the Council reviewed draft changes to the Observer Plan that were
developed by NMFS and a Council-Appointed Industry Oversight Committee. The Council recommended that NMFS make
the draft changes and initiate a rulemaking to implement them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule to implement the Council's recommendation was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 October 28, 1993 (58 FR 57979). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through November 29, 1993. Two letters of
comments were received and are summarized in the ``Response to Comments'' section of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the reasons for the draft changes to the Observer Plan and the comments on the proposed rule to implement
them, NMFS has determined that this action is necessary for fishery conservation and management and implements the
following changes to the Observer Plan and its implementing regulations at &sect;&sect;672.27 and 675.25. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Change the definition of a ``fishing trip'' and base observer coverage requirements on a new definition of ``fishing
days'' instead of ``fishing trip days''. ``Fishing day'' is defined as a 24-hour period from 0001 Alaska local time
(A.l.t.) through 2400 A.l.t. during which fishing gear is retrieved and groundfish, as defined at 50 CFR 672.2 and
675.2, are retained for further processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Increase observer coverage on vessels equal to or greater than 60 feet (ft)(18.3 m) in length overall (LOA) but
less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA during each calendar quarter, so that vessels in this size category are required to carry
an observer 30 percent of the fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels participate for more than 3
fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. Each vessel required to carry an observer during a calendar quarter
must carry an observer during at least one fishing trip for each of the following fisheries in which the vessel participates:
Pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, rockfish, flatfish, and other species of groundfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Increase observer coverage of vessels using hook-and-line gear in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA by requiring
operators of catcher/processor and catcher vessels using hook-and-line gear that participate in a directed fishery
for groundfish to carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip in the Eastern Regulatory Area
during each calendar quarter that they participate in a directed fishery for groundfish in this area;

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Revise observer coverage requirements for vessels using pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish,
so that each vessel using pot gear that is equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA is required to carry an observer during
at least 30 percent of its fishing days during each calendar quarter in which it participates for more than 3 days in
a directed groundfish pot gear fishery; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Revise the conflict of interest standards for NMFS-certified observers and observer contractors. Revisions
include: (1) Placing restrictions on observers who were employed in the observed fishery within the preceding 12
months; and (2) prohibiting observer contractors from assigning observers in response to requests for or against
a specific individual or a specific gender, race, creed, or age of individual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of these measures is to increase observer coverage of the groundfish harvests and to promote the fishery
management objectives of the FMPs. Further descriptions of, and reasons for, these measures are contained in the
preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR 57979, October 28, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of &sect;672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F), the effective date of the final rule is July 1, 1994. This date
coincides with the beginning of the third calendar quarter and will facilitate the implementation of new quarterly
observer coverage requirements by reducing confusion that would result from a mid-quarter effective date. Section
672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F) reduces observer coverage requirements for vessels 125 ft LOA or longer fishing for groundfish
with pot gear, and thus, provides relief to vessel operators in this category. Therefore, NMFS has determined that
the effective date for this section should not be delayed until July 1, 1994. The effective date for &sect;672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F)
is May 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes three changes from the proposed rule. These changes are described as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, technical changes are made to &sect;&sect;672.27 and 675.25 to include minor editorial revisions and metric
equivalents for specified lengths of vessels that require different levels of observer coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Second, &sect;672.27(c)(1)(v)(C) is amended to clarify that a catcher vessel delivering groundfish to a shoreside
processor or to a mothership in Alaska State waters during a weekly reporting period will be assigned to a fishery category
based on the retained catch composition of all groundfish delivered to processors during that weekly reporting period
and reported on Alaska Department of Fish and Game fish tickets.

Finally, the Observer Plan is corrected by removing from Attachment 3 (Standards of Observer Conduct) an inappropriate
reference to title 15 CFR subtitle A, part O, of the U.S. Department of Commerce Regulations. These regulations pertained
to standards of conduct for employees of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Certified observers are not NMFS employees
and therefore cannot be held to these standards. The Observer Plan continues to require certified observers to comply
with the conflict of interest standards and general standards of behavior set out in Attachments 3 and 4 of the amended
Plan.

Comment 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action bases observer coverage on fishing days instead of fishing trip days and increases observer coverage
on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA. This action would increase the
financial burden on the catcher boat fleet, particularly on those vessels delivering to shoreside facilities that
are required to have observer coverage. This results in an inequitable impact on the catcher boat fleet and further
aggravates the disproportionate effect of the Observer Program on catcher vessels. Given these effects, implementation
of measures to increase observer coverage should be delayed until after the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan
is effective.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS acknowledges that the proposed rule would increase observer costs for vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3
m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA that use trawl or hook-and-line gear to participate in a directed fishery for
Alaska groundfish. Larger vessels currently are required to have an observer on board at all times and are not affected
by the proposed change in coverage requirements. The increased observer coverage for vessels equal to or greater
than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA is necessary to obtain more adequate information on which the
groundfish fisheries are managed, including better estimates of groundfish catch, discard amounts, and prohibited
species bycatch rates. Delay of regulatory action to increase observer coverage until the North Pacific Fisheries
Research Plan is effective would neglect identified data requirements necessary for effective management of the
Alaska groundfish fisheries.

Comment 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The increased financial burden to the small boat fleet that will ensue from increased observer coverage is out of proportion
to the benefits that might result, particularly if NMFS continues to use observer data primarily as a basis for fishery
closures or enforcement, rather than for more effective fishery management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS's primary responsibility for inseason management of the groundfish resource is to monitor groundfish harvests
and prohibited species bycatch rates, so that when a groundfish total allowable catch (TAC) or a prohibited species
bycatch allowance is reached, fishery closures can be implemented to prevent specified TACs or bycatch allowances
from being exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing observer coverage requirements established for vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less
than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA were determined by the Council and its

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Observer Committee to be inadequate to meet data needs for effective monitoring of groundfish and prohibited species
catch amounts by this segment of the groundfish fleet. NMFS concurs in this determination and has approved the Council's
recommended increase in observer coverage for vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft
(38.1 m) LOA. The increase is intended to improve the level of observer coverage from this size class of vessel without
imposing costs that are disproportionate to the benefits that are anticipated to result from better inseason management
of the groundfish fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of observer data is not limited to inseason management of the fisheries and compliance monitoring of regulatory
programs. Observer data also are used to assess the status of fishery resources and as a basis for assessment and development
of management measures. NMFS has released certain observer data to the public under the Freedom of Information Act
for purposes of independent industry analyses of prohibited species bycatch rates and operational factors that
may reduce bycatch rates of these species. Additional observer data may be disclosed to support industry initiatives
to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates under a proposed rule published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2817). These Federal and private initiatives to use observer data for more effective fishery
management will be enhanced to the extent that more observer data are collected from vessels under 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA
as set out in this final rule.

Comment 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose and intent of the proposed rule to correct problems encountered by NMFS in administering observer coverage
on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA are supported. However, given the
direction in which the fishery management process is progressing, 30 percent coverage for these vessels likely is
inadequate; 100 percent observer coverage on all vessels capable of carrying an observer should be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One hundred percent observer coverage on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft LOA but less than 125 ft LOA has been required
for particular fisheries for specified areas and limited time periods to meet special management needs (59 FR 3000,
January 20, 1994, as modified at 59 FR 4009, January 28, 1994, and 59 FR 15346, April l, 1994). However, the additional
costs associated with 100 percent observer coverage on all vessels in the groundfish fishery under 125 ft LOA in all
areas at all times would impose disproportionate costs on this sector of the groundfish fleet and, therefore, are
not now justified under the current open access groundfish management program. NMFS will continue to assess the need
for increased observer coverage to meet special resource or fishery management needs.

Comment 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite support for the proposed action, concerns remain about the ability of vessels to manipulate observer coverage
in certain fisheries and/or in certain areas where prohibited species bycatch rates may be higher. To address these
concerns, the final rule should be amended to require a vessel equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than
125 ft (38.1 m) LOA to carry an observer for 30 percent of the days it engages in any particular fishery during any calendar
quarter in which it meets the threshold (3-day) minimum requirement on a fishery-by-fishery basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule limits the manipulation of observer coverage by decreasing the number of fishing days in a quarter that
trigger observer coverage requirements, basing coverage requirements on fishing days rather than fishing trip
days, and requiring observation of at least one trip for each fishery that a vessel participates in during a quarter.
These measures should reduce the potential for manipulation of observer coverage and increase the amount of observer
data available for the management of specific fisheries. Nonetheless, an opportunity still exists for a vessel operator
to manipulate observer coverage to reduce or increase coverage in different fisheries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EA/RIR/FRFA prepared for this action considered an alternative for increased observer coverage similar to the
one presented in Comment 4. The alternative was more stringent and could provide more observer data of certain fisheries
relative to the preferred alternative implemented under this final rule. However, this alternative was not adopted
by the Council for several reasons. First, concerns were expressed that some fishermen would have difficulties complying
with 30 percent observer coverage in each fishery because fishermen would need to be aware of and plan for the target
fishery each trip and keep track of the exact number of fishing days by fishery. Second, 30 percent coverage by fishery
would be relatively more expensive for a vessel in the 60&hyph;125 ft (18.3 m&hyph;38.1 m) LOA category to comply with
relative to the preferred alternative. Last, compliance monitoring would be more difficult and associated enforcement
costs would be increased relative to the preferred alternative under the final rule due to calculations to check 30
percent observer coverage by fishery.

Comment 5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action to increase coverage of the longline fisheries in the eastern GOA is inadequate for two reasons.
First, the proposed action is subject to manipulation. Second, the overall level of reliable observer-generated
data from the hook-and-line gear fleet in the eastern GOA is deplorable. To respond to these inadequacies, the final
rule should require all vessels in the 60&hyph;125 ft (18.3&hyph;38.1 m) LOA category that use hook-and-line gear
to carry observers a minimum of 30 percent of the fishing days they operate in the eastern GOA during any particular
calendar quarter on a fishery-by-fishery basis. Furthermore, NMFS should make a concerted effort to place observers
on vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA so that data can be gathered about the operating characteristics of the small boat
fleet that accounts for most of the hook-and-line harvest in the eastern GOA.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternative coverage requirements suggested in Comment 5 for longline vessels in the eastern GOA was considered
by the Council, but not adopted for reasons similar to those presented in the response to Comment 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered lowering the size limit for vessels required to carry observers to vessels less than 60 ft (18.3
m) LOA. The Council did not adopt this alternative because of increased costs to industry and increased chance of injury
to an observer or crew on small vessels because of limited working space and accommodations. Under the current Observer
Plan, NMFS has determined that implementation of changes to the observer coverage requirements for vessels under
60 ft (18.3 m) LOA would require separate regulatory action. Furthermore, staffing and budget constraints prevent
NMFS from placing employees onboard small vessels to serve as observers. Given these regulatory and practical constraints,
observer coverage requirements for the small boat fleet would best be pursued under the North Pacific Fisheries Research
Plan, which is pending approval and implementation by the Secretary.

Comment 6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action to lower observer coverage on vessels using pot gear is premature and not supported as long as observer
data generated from the pot gear fisheries are used for allocative purposes. Data used to support allocative measures
should be based on comparable levels of observer coverage. Therefore, observer coverage on vessels using pot gear
should remain unchanged until an individual vessel quota system is implemented that will effectively address resource
allocation issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the implementation of the domestic observer program in 1990, observer data collected onboard pot gear vessels
participating in a directed fishery for groundfish consistently indicate that relatively low levels of prohibited
species bycatch mortality are associated with these operations. The Council recommended that NMFS reduce the observer
coverage requirements for pot vessels equal to or greater than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA from 100 percent to 30 percent because
of the very low bycatch mortality associated with these operations and the Council's expressed policy to encourage
selective fishing practices that typically experience low prohibited species bycatch mortality rates. Under the
final rule, the resulting levels of observer coverage of vessels using pot gear will assure the collection of sufficient
observer data to identify any changes in assumed bycatch mortality rates and other factors that may affect future
resource allocation issues.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Congregate Housing Services Demonstration Program was first established by the Congregate Housing Services
Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8001). It provided congregate housing and coordinated supportive services for elderly disabled
and non-elderly disabled individuals to allow them to maintain their independence and avoid costly and unnecessary
institutionalization. Congress appropriated funds for fiscal years 1979 through 1982, to remain available until
expended. Since then, Congress has appropriated funds annually to continue the grantees funded. The Congregate
Housing Services Program was implemented through the HUD Congregate Housing Services Handbook (4640.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 28, 1990, the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8011) (NAHA) was enacted. In section 802, Congress
specifically directed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA)
through the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) to jointly implement regulations to carry out the Congregate Housing
Services Program (CHSP). Section 802 provides for congregate services which are minimally necessary to prevent
premature or unnecessary institutionalization of frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities regardless
of whether a person is elderly, or temporarily disabled persons living in eligible housing for the elderly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD and FmHA shall enter into grants with States, units of general local government, Indian tribes, PHAs, IHAs, and
local nonprofit housing sponsors, to provide congregate services. An IHA, PHA, and local non-profit housing sponsor
can enter into grants only on behalf of its project. States, units of general local government and Indian tribes may
enter into grants on behalf of for profit or not for profit owners of eligible housing. Each grant agreement shall be
made for a term of five years and shall be renewable (subject to the availability of funds) at the expiration of the term
by the Secretary concerned. The CHSP funds will provide for not more than 40 percent of the cost of providing the congregate
services program; at least 50 percent of the total cost will come from the grantee or third party organization, and
at least 10 percent from the program participant (up to a maximum of 20% of the participant's adjusted income). Program
participant fees may be waived by the Secretary concerned for eligible residents without income. In instances where
a waiver is granted, the grantee and the Secretary concerned will share the deficit on a 50/50 basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee will develop a supportive services plan and a case management process as part of the application. Supportive
services include meals, transportation, personal care (which may include dressing, bathing, and toileting), housekeeping,
chore assistance, non-medical counseling, group and socialization activities, non-medical supervision, wellness
programs, preventive health screening, monitoring of medication consistent with State law, personal emergency
response systems, and other requested supportive services if approved by the Secretary concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under NAHA, eligible housing projects that were receiving assistance under the Congregate Housing Services Act
of 1978 on November 28, 1990 shall continue to receive priority for assistance funded under that Act. These grantees
will receive priority for assistance under this section after the expiration of the term of the grant. Each grantee
shall maintain, for the six-year transition period, the same dollar amount of its annual contributions in support
of the activities eligible for assistance under this section equal to the amount contributed for such activities
in the year ending on November 28, 1990. The grantee's contribution shall be equal to no less than the amount of the eligible
owner's annual contribution plus any inflationary increases allowed by the Secretary concerned. At the end of six
years, each grantee must meet the requirements of the new Congregate program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 28, 1992, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA of 1992) was enacted (Public Law 102&hyph;550).
Sections 604 and 672 of the HCDA of 1992 amended section 802 of NAHA. Section 604 amended section 802(i)(1)(B)(i) of
NAHA by increasing from three to six years the period of time that grantees funded under the Congregate Housing Services
Act of 1978 would be exempt from the requirement to provide 50% matching funds upon expiration of the term of the grant.
It also increased the three-year requirement for maintenance of funds contributed by the grantee to six years. Section
672 of the HCDA of 1992, amended section 802(d)(4) of NAHA by requiring that service coordinators be trained in the
aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility for and procedures of Federal and applicable State
entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing service coordination, drug and alcohol use
and abuse by the elderly, and mental health issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 8, 1992, HUD and FmHA published a joint interim rule and invited the public to comment on it for consideration
in drafting the final joint common rule. The public was also invited to comment and provide suggestions concerning
the implementation of the retrofitting and renovation components of the Congregate Housing Services Program. The
joint final rule responds to public comments on the joint interim rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FmHA and HUD are promulgating identical regulations applicable to the Congregate Housing Services Program.
Since the regulations are identical, the text of the regulations is set out only once at the end of the common preamble.
The part heading, table of contents, and authority citation for the regulations as they will appear in each CFR title
follow the text of the final common rule. The entire text of the regulations as they will appear in each CFR title follows
the text of the final common rule. The entire text of the regulation will appear in the respective parts of the Code of
Federal Regulations of both FmHA and HUD.

II. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received 9 comments on the December 8, 1992, joint interim rule. The comments were from governmental entities,
public housing agencies (PHAs), nonprofit organizations, HUD field offices and advocacy groups for the aging.

One comment was directed to the overall program with the commenter stating that the language in the rule was too complex
and that the number of repetitions was ``dumbfounding''. The commenter stated that he would like to see a ``simple
and common English explanation of how employment will impact an elderly individual's Section 8 or 236 rent subsidy,
medicare premiums and 551 payments. The commenter also indicated that he would like to see a concise list of the duties
of a service coordinator.

 HUD and FmHA response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CHSP does not set income limits for the section 8 program or for the Section 236 program. The CHSP also does not set
requirements regarding medicaid and section 551. The regulations concerning the definition of income and income
limits for participants in the section 8 program can be found at 24 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 813. The CHSP
interim rule has been simplified in the final version of the rule. Section

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated the rule appears to discriminate against the housing authority that has not been able to accumulate
unrestricted funds sufficient to purchase services, and that many housing authorities already have in place (prior
to 1992 and 1993), eligible housing for the elderly already adapted for use with frail elderly and persons with disabilities
for the purpose of preventing unnecessary institutionalization, without having grant funds available to them under
the Congregate Housing Service Program. This commenter also indicated that the interim common rule clearly contradicts
the intent and spirit of the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD and FmHA response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP
be shared between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. The grantee or other third party shall provide 50% of the
cost of providing the CHSP; the Secretary concerned shall provide no more than 40% of the cost of providing CHSP; and
fees from the program participant shall provide at least 10% of the cost. HUD and FmHA recognize that there are many
projects that already had supportive services programs in existence prior to the implementation of this CHSP and
therefore, cannot use existing services as match for the CHSP. In accordance with the statutory requirement, only
new or expanded services can be used as match. The matching funds provided by the grantee must cover at least 50% of the
cost of providing supportive services under the CHSP. The rule is consistent with the statutory purpose which is to
provide new or expanded supportive services in federally assisted housing to prevent premature institutionalization
in a manner that respects the dignity of the elderly and persons with disabilities and the cost sharing requirements
of the program.

One commenter stated that the interim joint rule does not require applicants to address transition to other service
programs in the event of cessation of CHSP funding. The commenter suggested that the rule include a provision which
would provide that requests for grant application include a plan for the continuation of necessary services or transition
to other service providers in the event CHSP funds are no longer available.

While HUD and FmHA share the commenter's concern for a commitment from the applicant to continue to provide services
in the event funds are no longer appropriated for this program, it was agreed not to impose any additional paperwork
or commitments upon the applicant. Applicants are experiencing difficulties obtaining matching funds and it was
agreed that requiring the grantees to factor in funds for continuation or transition to other service providers five
years in advance would be too burdensome.

The rule does not contain application requirements. The application requirements are set forth in the Notice of Funding
Availability (NOFA) for the CHSP. The NOFA announces the availability of funds and sets forth the application requirements.
HUD and FmHA will publish a new NOFA announcing the availability of funding and the application requirements. The
commenter's suggestion will be considered in drafting the NOFA for fiscal year 1994.

One commenter states that the regulation should be amended to allow the 10% of the total program costs that are required
to be generated by participants' fees to be generated by participants' fees, contributions, or the cost-sharing
that is already required by an existing program eligible for match rather than just through participant fees. The

.240(a) preclude the use of otherwise eligible local match programs that permit contributions, but not fees, or which
already charge cost-share fees. The commenter states that if fees generated by participant fees, contributions,
or cost-sharing already in an existing program eligible for match are allowed, HUD can retain the CHSP's program's
intent to incorporate a participant expense sharing component and will also address the significant barriers to
sufficient fee-generation that applicants will experience because of the different fee-charge regulations in
a variety of programs that would logically be used for the CHSP matching requirements.

.240 of the rule has been revised to allow fees to include cash contributions of the program participant, food stamps
and any other contributions or donations. Cost sharing and fees collected by any eligible new or expanded service
program for the CHSP are currently eligible. However, due to the statutory constraints concerning matching funds,
funds for existing services which are not expanded are not eligible for match. Matching funds must pay for 50% of the
cost of the services under CHSP and therefore, only costs for new or expanded services are eligible for match.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged the Department to reconsider its definition of activities of daily living (ADL) and the way that
its definition is applied in the interim common rule. The commenter stated that the definition of ADL promulgated
in the new rule combines what are now commonly known in the worlds of gerontological research and community-based
aging programs as ``activities of daily living'' (ADL) and ``instrumentalities of daily living'' (IDL). The commenter
stated that the rule definition of ADL was created by combining these terms without regard to what is currently used
in the community and other common programs. The commenter argues that this definition is not in the spirit of coordination
of housing and services which it believes is intended by the CHSP. The commenter further states that the way in which
the definition of activities of daily living is applied is ``antithetical to the concept of aging in place.'' The commenter
states that when one looks at the definition and all its caveats, the potential population to be served is not what is
commonly known as the frail elderly but rather a fairly narrow niche of somewhat frail older adults. The commenter
stated that while it understands HUD might want to be cautious about this definition in order to maintain a housing
rather than an institutional character to its developments, it is also important that such appropriateness decisions
be reviewed on an individual rather than a categorical basis whenever possible.

HUD and FmHA response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Program participants are limited to the frail elderly deficient in at least three activities of daily living by statute.
Therefore, HUD and FmHA decided to combine the ADL's and IDL's based upon HUD's past experiences in operating the CHSP
of 1978. By combining ADLs and IDLs for the definition of ADLs and stating the minimum deficiency level, the program
is able to serve a larger population of frail elderly persons than would be served by the traditional definitions of
the ADLs.

Qualifying supportive services and eligible activities should not tie directly into the requirements of ADL. The
ADLs are used to determine if frail elderly persons are minimally eligible to participate in the program. Program
participants (frail elderly persons deficient in at least three ADLs and persons with disabilities) would then be
eligible to receive qualifying supportive services such as non-medical supervision and personal emergency response
systems, if they need them.

 Nonresident elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled are eligible to participate
in CHSP at the option of the program management in consultation with project residents. The program management has
the discretion to deny nonresidents participation in the program if their participation is not cost-effective or
if it adds to the need for assistance under the program. Nonresidents who receive services under CHSP must pay a fee
equal to the cost of the services provided. Nonresidents are not eligible for CHSP funds to subsidize their costs for
services.

 The commenter states that the 50% match requirement for the grantee or eligible owner is excessively burdensome and
may result in an inordinate amount of program failures. These program failures would have the ultimate result of doing
harm to the program participants who relocate to the congregate housing locations in reliance on the programs. The
commenter also states that the rules as written necessitate the inclusion of a great deal of estimated information
in the budget. The commenter states that while service costs may be known, the likelihood of program failure increases
because the number of participants, types of services to be requested and the ability of the participant to pay cannot
be known until program startup.

 Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP

 One commenter stated that the 50% match requirement and the restrictions on what can be counted as in-kind service
are barriers that the rule presents which causes its housing authority to be unable to participate in the program.
The commenter suggests that in instances like its own where projects have limited resources that it be allowed to count
the services already provided as in-kind match. The commenter also contends that local community services are already
``maxed'' out because housing authorities have been successful in having a number of services provided by community
agencies and that the housing authorities prior to the grant period have already invested as much or more than the match
requirement.

in developing a CHSP and may also discourage many nonprofit owners from applying and participating in the program.

fee deficits. The commenter also suggests that the regulations should allow the CHSP to use other income sources to
make up for any resident-fee deficit that arises because of the 20% cap on resident fees, or that arises because the
local program match program permits only contributions. The commenter states that contributions should be permitted
to count as part of the fee amount and that the regulations should be amended to allow a flexible sliding scale fee schedule
for participants for whom 20% or even 10% of adjusted income is too costly or where 10% of the cost of a specific fee is
too high. Commenter also states that there should be more flexible fee waivers to include participants who are at or
below the poverty level.

 There were several comments and suggestions concerning the retrofitting and renovation component of the Congregate
Housing Services Program. Several commenters expressed discontent with the decisions not to fund the retrofit and
renovation component and the failure to implement regulations. Many stated that the retrofit component was an integral
and critical part of the program. One commenter stated that HUD and FmHA had the authority and the flexibility to allocate
some funding for retrofit in order to have the program in place for full funding later. There was a general concern for
the Department's failure to develop interim regulations in order to implement retrofit once funding is made available.

of regulations implementing the retrofit and renovation component at a later date.

 The General Counsel of HUD, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the policies contained in this rule will have some significant impact on the maintenance and general
well-being of families. The revised CHSP can be expected to provide supportive services which can prevent or postpone
unnecessary or premature institutionalization, and reduce unnecessary stress and financial burdens on participants'
families by allowing them to remain in their apartments. Because the impact on family concerns is wholly beneficial,
no further review under the executive order is considered necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The program under this part provides for minimal supportive services to the frail elderly, persons with disabilities
and temporarily disabled individuals as a means of preventing unnecessary institutionalization and encouraging
deinstitutionalization. The program also provides management with the capacity to assess the service needs of eligible
residents and to locate and arrange for the delivery of community based supportive services. The program is implemented
in a manner that both respects the dignity of the participants and encourages their independence. The provision of
supportive services allows for a continuum of care on a long term basis and offers another option in supportive living
arrangements. The program functions as an active proponent of community based care and affords an opportunity for
housing projects to become an additional source for supportive service delivery in the local area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The program is additionally designed to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Improve the quality of life of older Americans living in federally assisted housing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Preserve the viability of existing affordable housing projects for low income older residents who are aging
in place by assisting managers of housing with the difficulties and challenges created by serving older residents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Develop partnerships between the Federal Government and State governments in providing services to the frail
elderly and persons with disabilities and the temporarily disabled, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Utilize Federal and State funds in a more cost-effective and humane way in serving the needs of older adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Activity of Daily Living (ADL) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means an activity regularly necessary for personal care and includes eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing
or serving food, but must be able to feed self); dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance);
bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self; grooming (may need
assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance); getting in and out of bed and chairs,
walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework,
grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor
and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring
mobility devices). Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be
deficient in his or her ability to perform at a specified minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person
must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of whether a person is deficient in this minimal level of performance
must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants
to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving
food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy
the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance
become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those
offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant

agency on a fee-for-service basis, and may serve less than full-time. The Service Coordinator or the case management
agency providing service coordination shall not provide supportive services under a CHSP grant or have a financial

(2) Establish professional relationships with all agencies and service providers in the community, and develop
a directory of providers for use by program staff and program participants;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Refer proposed participants to service providers in the community, or those of the grantee. Serve as staff to the
PAC. Complete, for the PAC, all paperwork necessary for the assessment, referral, case monitoring and reassessment
processes; implement the case plan developed by the PAC and agreed to by the program participant. Maintain necessary
case files on each program participant, containing such information and kept in such form that HUD and FmHA shall require.
Provide the files to PAC members upon request, in connection with PAC duties;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Monitor the ongoing provision of services from community agencies and keep the PAC and the agency providing the
supportive service informed of the progress of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Educate grant recipient's program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability,
and program participant options and responsibilities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Establish volunteer support programs with service organizations in the community;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Assist the grant recipient to build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Educate other project management staff on issues related to ``aging-in-place'' and services coordination,
to help them to work with and assist other persons receiving housing assistance through the grantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Service coordinators shall not serve as members of the PAC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) For a Service Coordinator obtained under contract with a case management agency, the contract must include provisions
containing, at a minimum: beginning and end dates of the contract; number and responsibilities of staff provided
by the agency; rates of pay/costs of services to be provided; location of offices, and an agreement to provide HUD and
FmHA access to the files; and other documentation pertinent to the Congregate Housing Services Program. Any contracts
awarded or purchases made under this subsection by grantees that are public bodies must conform to the policies and
procedures stated at 24 CFR 85.36.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) (1) Each frail elderly person, person with disabilities and temporarily disabled individual tentatively selected
by the grantee must be assessed for degree of functional incapacity before being accepted into the Congregate Housing
Services Program. The assessment is performed by a voluntary PAC, which handles the individual's entrance into and
the transition out of the Congregate Housing Services Program, development of case plans for that person, and regular
reassessment of the individuals in the program. PAC members may not be paid with Congregate program grant funds, but
if the duties and responsibilities of the PAC are discharged by a community agency, the agency's costs may be counted
as matching funds for any time spent on assessments after the initial approval of program participants, if approved
by the Secretary concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The PAC, upon completion of the assessment, must make a recommendation to the Service Coordinator for acceptance
into (or denial of acceptance into) the Congregate Program. In the case of an acceptance, the PAC must provide a case
plan for each eligible resident. Once an individual is accepted into the CHSP it is the responsibility of the Service
Coordinator to tailor the case plan to the needs of that participant, and to work with community agencies, the grantee
and third party service providers to ensure that the services are provided on a regular, ongoing, and satisfactory
basis, in accordance with the plan. Before actual acceptance into the Congregate Housing Services Program, the eligible
resident must work with the PAC and the Service Coordinator in developing his or her supportive services plan. Acceptance
of any services under the plan by the program participant is voluntary. In developing this plan, the PAC must take into
consideration the participant's needs and wants and must provide the minimum supportive services necessary to maintain
independence. If participants want other services, they can buy them at cost, if available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A professional assessment committee, under paragraph (b) of this section, shall identify eligible project residents
and shall designate services appropriate to the functional abilities and needs of each eligible project resident.
The committee shall utilize procedures that ensure that the process of determining eligibility of individuals for
congregate services affords individuals fair treatment, due process and a right of appeal of the determination of
eligibility, and shall ensure the confidentiality of personal and medical records. A professional assessment committee
under this section shall consist of not less than three individuals, who shall be appointed to the committee by the
officials of the eligible housing project responsible for the congregate services program. It shall include at least
one qualified medical or other health professional and social services professionals competent to appraise the
functional abilities of frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities and temporarily disabled individuals
in relation to the performance of tasks of daily living. Service coordinators shall not serve as PAC members. PAC members
are subject to the conflict of interest provisions in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.245(f). The PAC may be either a voluntary committee appointed by the project management or an agency in the community
which provides assessment services and can conform to HUD and FmHA requirements. At least one PAC member shall not
have any direct or indirect relationship to the grantee. No PAC member may be affiliated with organizations providing
services under the grant. If a case management agency provides the service coordination, the agency may not be affiliated
with the organization providing supportive services under the grant.

Operating procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PAC shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recommend, to the Service Coordinator, persons eligible for entrance, or for transition out of, CHSP;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Authorize or perform medical evaluations, if necessary. These evaluations may be performed by a PAC medical professional,
or the applicants to CHSP may be referred to another agency in the community that will perform the evaluation without
charge;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recommend, and update as necessary, a supportive services plan for each frail elderly person or person with disabilities,
or temporarily disabled person;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Obtain and retain information in files concerning program participants. The files should contain such information
and be maintained in such form, as HUD and FmHA shall require;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Present written evaluations to the grantee; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Allow program participants to appeal decisions related to entrance to, degree of participation needed, and transition
out of CHSP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duties of the PAC. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PAC is required to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Perform a formal assessment of each potential elderly program participant's deficiencies in performing the
ADLs. This assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the Service Coordinator, and shall include a review
of the adequacy of the informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the potential participant
to assist in meeting the ADL needs of that individual);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine that each elderly program participant is deficient in at least three ADLs. The minimum requirements
of ADL include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting
to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility
requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified
minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of
whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be
performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person
requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual
would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides
assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated
at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities
of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive supportive
services paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determine that non-elderly disabled individuals qualify under the definition of person with disabilities under
&sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.105;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Perform a regular assessment and updating of the supportive services plan of all participants;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Replace any members of the PAC within 30 days after a member resigns. A PAC shall not do formal assessments if its
membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has not been replaced by
the grantee;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Notify the grantee or eligible owner and the program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures,
and provide these parties with a process and reasonable time period in which to review and comment, before adoption
of a modification;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in selection of CHSP participants, with respect to race, religion, color,
sex, national origin, familial status or type of disability;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the
Privacy Act of 1974;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedural rights of participants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The PAC must provide an informal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance to due
process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Serving the participant with a written notice containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections
before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Prompt written notification of the final decision to the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Procedures must ensure that any frail elderly person, person with disabilities, or temporarily disabled person
(and program participant upon reassessment) has the option of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive
services as part of the case planning process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In situations where an individual requests additional services, not initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC
must make a determination whether the request is legitimately a needs-based service that can be covered under the
CHSP subsidy. Individuals can pay for services other than those recommended by the PAC as long as the additional services
do not interfere with the efficient operation of the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility, admissions and transition-out procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Before selecting frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or temporarily disabled participants,
each grantee (with PAC assistance) shall develop a supportive services application form for the use of persons applying
for supportive services under CHSP. The information in the individual's supportive services application is crucial
to the PAC's determination of the need for further physical or psychological evaluation of any individual who wishes
to receive the supportive services offered. The application should include: any intake form, the ADL assessment,
and appropriate comments from both the applicant's physician and the Service Coordinator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The grantee or PAC must develop procedures for providing for an individual's transition out of the CHSP to another
setting. Transition out is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by an individual to continue to live
independently. If a program participant is transitioned out of the program, but wishes to retain supportive services,
he or she may do so, as long as he or she remains income eligible, continues to live in an eligible project, and pays the
full cost of services provided. A participant can be transitioned out of CHSP if he or she:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gains physical and mental health and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time
(in which case readmission, based upon reassessment to determine the degree of frailty or the disability, is acceptable);

of assistance exceeding $100,000 in budget authority to certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on
lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. The rule also requires disclosures from applicants, among
others, if nonappropriated funds have been spent or committed for lobbying activities if those activities would
be prohibited if paid with appropriated funds. The law provides substantial monetary penalties for failure to file
the required certification or disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies in order to
implement provisions added to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and
the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies
is to assure that those agencies are, for HEA and other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality of
education or training offered by the institutions of higher education or higher education programs they accredit.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under Title IV of the HEA (referred to as ``Title IV, HEA programs'') and many other Federal programs, the
Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution
of higher education.'' Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible
institution of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary
as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element
requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level
in the State in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must
be certified by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the
framework for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure
that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality
education or training worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this
responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the triad.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities
of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program
Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized
by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are specified in detail. Part H also provides
a new oversight responsibility for States: The State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes
a set of responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated
evaluation of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute
for the three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will require leadership in both implementation and evaluation
if it is to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The Secretary will take steps to assure that the various
responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions
that should not be eligible to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the basis of either the quality of education
they offer or their inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the Secretary is committed to carrying out
the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the triad members that are inherent in the statute in a manner
that causes the least burden to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will
review carefully the applications of accrediting bodies and the standards and operating plans proposed by State
Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review Program to insure that they meet the
requirements of the statute and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to fulfill their statutory
purposes. The Secretary will also place a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education Participation
System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, which will contain the information that the Secretary generates
in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary
will use the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn
carry out their responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to the Secretary's effective selection
of institutions for program review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very important key to effective management. The Secretary
will evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department to determine their effectiveness
in improving the integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and will take such steps as may be indicated
to improve the results. Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the advice and counsel of the National
Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the effectiveness of the triad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary
one, with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the
focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs they
accredit. States, in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within the state required for participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria related to institutional
performance in the Title IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is on the administrative
and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the functions and responsibilities of each of the triad members are generally different, the statute does require,
in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary
functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas from different perspectives for different purposes.
For example, all three of the triad members are required to examine the finances of an institution. If each looks at
financial strength from a perspective complementary to that of the others, accrediting agencies would focus principally
on the capacity of the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of quality sufficient to meet accrediting
agency standards and to fulfill the institution's mission over a 5&hyph;10 year period of accreditation. The emphasis
of a review by a SPRE would be on whether or not the institution possesses the full range of resources needed to serve
students currently attending the institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the institution's finances
in light of its ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, to provide
the administrative resources necessary to comply with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all
of its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to
the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically
possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject to three different standards regulating the same
area of operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary
expects accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in establishing their own standards to insure that
varying standards do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also important that accrediting agencies
and States not impose any standard that is weaker than a comparable Title IV, HEA program standard. The Secretary believes
coordination of this is a federal responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the complementary approach to the functions of the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example,
that institutions should not have to develop different methodologies to provide data that the three members of the
triad may require. The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any other requests for data about the
institution, its students, or its graduates should rely on information already in the institution's possession.
To that end, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data based on the methodology
that will be specified in the regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992, or, where the institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, such as a system
designed to provide data to a State higher education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the format
already being used by the institution. Similarly, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the
audited financial statements institutions are now required to provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent
those statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews conducted under their respective standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration,
also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to those included in part H. The suggestion has been made
that the Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of overlap so that institutions would not be subject
to varying standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad members. However, the Secretary interprets
part H as permitting States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, as opposed to using a Federal
standard, and also believes that this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not clear how the requirements
of the different agencies are compatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of these programs administered
by other agencies may be very different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this alternative. The Secretary
does believe that it would be useful to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies that are similar
to those of part H might be coordinated to reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such exploration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed at the national level should be made available to institutions,
as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In
particular, data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific fields and information concerning graduation
and withdrawal rates at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad members and institutions. The Secretary
will facilitate the development of this type of information and, where possible under the auspices of the Department,
will coordinate the development of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives
of the triad members and institutions to exchange information about the gatekeeping process and to discuss how the
triad is functioning, both in identifying institutions whose performance is questionable and in reporting requirements
that have proven to be unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments concerning the functioning of the
triad, as it is implemented through these and other regulations governed by part H. The Secretary will seek improvement,
where possible, within existing regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to the statute itself
if experience indicates those changes are both necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden,
and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 602 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 3578). The NPRM included, on pages 3578&hyph;3601, a thorough discussion of the major issues addressed by the
proposed regulations. The following is a brief summary of the major proposed changes to the Secretary's Procedures
and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies that were contained in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As required by section 496(m) of the HEA, the proposed regulations authorized the Secretary to recognize only those
accrediting agencies that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose
of enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either
by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. As required by section 496(a) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies whose accreditation
enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to be administratively
and financially separate from and independent of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership
organization. In accordance with the statute, the proposed regulations allowed the Secretary to waive this requirement
under certain conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The proposed regulations added two new steps to the process by which accrediting agencies are recognized by the
Secretary. First, the Secretary proposed to give an agency seeking recognition the opportunity to respond in writing
to the designated Department official's analysis of its application for recognition before the application was
reviewed by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity. Second, after the Advisory
Committee's review of the agency's application and recommendation to the Secretary, the Secretary proposed to give
both the agency and the designated Department official an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In accordance with section 496(n) of the HEA, the proposed regulations permitted the Department, at the Secretary's
discretion, to conduct unannounced site visits to an accrediting agency or its member institutions or programs as
part of the Department's analysis of the agency's application for recognition or its compliance with the requirements
for recognition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In accordance with section 496(l) of the HEA, the proposed regulations allowed the Secretary to limit, suspend,
or terminate an agency's recognition if the Secretary determined that the agency failed to meet the requirements
for recognition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The proposed regulations eliminated the provision contained in previous regulations that, in order to demonstrate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience in accreditation, an agency had to demonstrate that its policies, evaluation methods, and decisions
were accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. As required by section 496(c)(1) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required an accrediting agency whose accreditation
enables the institutions it accredits to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to conduct, in addition
to its regular announced on-site review of an institution, at least one unannounced on-site review of each institution
that provides prebaccalaureate vocational education or training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to assess any new or substantively changed program before
including it in the agency's previous grant of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. As required by section 496(a)(5) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to have standards
that assess curricula; faculty; facilities, equipment and supplies; fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate
to the specified scale of operation; student support services; recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars,
catalogs, publications, grading and advertising; program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject
matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered; measures of program length in clock hours
or credit hours; success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission; default rates
in student loan programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Title IV of the HEA; record of student complaints received by, or available to, the accrediting agency; and the
institution's compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. As required by section 484B of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to have a standard
that assesses an institution's practice of making refunds to students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The proposed regulations required an accrediting agency to take adverse action against an institution or program
that failed to bring itself into compliance with agency standards within a time frame established by the agency. The
proposed regulations permitted this time frame to exceed 18 months only for cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. As required by section 496(c) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies whose accreditation
enables institutions to participate in Title IV, HEA programs to take special action whenever institutions establish
new branch campuses. Specifically, agencies must approve a business plan for the branch before its opening and conduct
an on-site review within six months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. As required by section 496(c) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to conduct an
on-site review within six months at any institution that undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. As required by section 496(c) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required that any institution that enters into
a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teach-out agreement with another institution must agree to submit to its accrediting agency for approval a teach-out
agreement that is consistent with applicable standards and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes Resulting From Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the comments received concerning the NPRM, and as discussed in detail in the appendix, the Secretary
has made the following significant changes in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The term ``prebaccalaureate vocational education'' has been deleted from these final regulations. The term ``vocational
education'' has been redefined to be ``an instructional program, below the bachelor's level, designed to prepare
individuals with the skills and training required for employment in a specific trade, occupation, or profession
related to the instructional program.'' This definition is consistent with that used for the term ``vocational program''
in the final regulations governing the State Postsecondary Review Program. This definition was chosen because it
is basically the same as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) glossary definition of an ``occupationally
specific program,'' and institutions already use this term in reporting enrollment data for various types of vocational
education. The advantage in using this definition is that the IPEDS inventory of occupationally specific programs
provides a list of instructional programs which, if offered by an institution, subject the institution to an unannounced
inspection by its accrediting agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. A new section, &sect;602.5_Notice to accrediting agencies of Federal actions, has been added that provides for
the Secretary to notify an accrediting agency if the Secretary takes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an action against an institution or program accredited by the agency, if the Secretary learns of an action taken by
another Federal agency against the institution or program, or if the institution is referred for review under the
State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Time frames have been added for the designated Department official to provide an accrediting agency with the staff
analysis of its application for recognition and for the agency to respond to that analysis, if it so desires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The provision that an accrediting agency may request that the Secretary reconsider a decision to deny recognition
or to limit, suspend, or terminate the agency's recognition during the recognition period has been deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The requirement that institutional accrediting agencies must conduct unannounced site visits to institutions
that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education has been replaced with a requirement that those agencies must
conduct unannounced inspections at each institution that offers vocational education for the purpose of determining
whether, at a minimum, the institution has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have either during
its most recent on-site review by the accrediting agency or in subsequent reports to the agency. Accrediting agencies
are free to determine the procedures for conducting the unannounced inspections. An unannounced inspection does
not have to be as comprehensive as an agency's full accreditation or preaccreditation review of an institution or
program unless the agency wishes it to be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The substantive change requirement has been revised to clarify the types of changes that require prior approval
by an accrediting agency before they can be included in the institution's accreditation. The substantive change
requirement applies only to institutional accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The specific language included in the NPRM for each of the 12 required accreditation standards has been deleted.
The section now simply repeats the statutory language for each required standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The requirement that accrediting agencies must have a standard that assesses an institution's practice of making
refunds to students has been eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The time limit for institutions or programs to come into compliance with agency standards has been changed. For
programs of less than one year in length, the time limit is now 12 months. For programs that are at least one year in length
but less than two years, the time limit is 18 months. For programs that are at least two years in length, the time limit
is 24 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must notify the Secretary at the same time they notify an
institution or program of a final adverse accrediting action.

The annual reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 47 hours per respondent, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. This annual reporting estimate takes into account the
fact that the average recognition period granted to accrediting agencies is five years. The total annual reporting
burden for the estimated 96 respondents is 4,512 hours.

In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the regulations in this document would require transmission
of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based
on the response to the proposed regulations and on the Department's own review, the Secretary has determined that
these regulations do not require the transmission of information concerning accrediting agencies that is being
gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Where specific provisions of these
regulations require the transmission of information concerning institutions or programs that is similar to that
being collected by the Department for other purposes, such as for the State Postsecondary Review Program or the Department's
review of institutions seeking to become certified to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, these regulations
have been modified to minimize the burden on institutions. A detailed discussion of the changes to the regulations
is provided in the appendix to these regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If a recognized institutional accrediting agency takes an adverse action with respect to a dually-accredited

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The agency routinely shares with other appropriate recognized accrediting agencies and State agencies information
about the accreditation or preaccreditation status of an institution or program and any adverse actions it has taken
against an accredited or preaccredited institution or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An accrediting agency is subject to the requirements contained in paragraph (a) of this section if the accrediting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix will not be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An analysis of the comments and the changes to the regulations follows. General comments that refer to broad issues
rather than a specific section or sections of the proposed regulations are discussed first, followed by a discussion
of other issues in the order in which they appeared in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that not all comments are discussed in this appendix. There are several reasons for this. First,
many of the concerns expressed by commenters were directed to the statute, not the proposed regulations. In some instances,
those comments are mentioned in the discussion that follows because of the importance of the issues that were raised.
In most instances, however, they are not mentioned because the Secretary is not legally authorized to make the changes
suggested by commenters. Second, many commenters made excellent suggestions for editorial and technical changes,
as well as other minor changes, that, in the Secretary's opinion, strengthened the regulations; the Secretary has
merely incorporated these suggestions without comment. For example, in &sect;602.11(b)(1)(ii) the Secretary
received a comment that it was better to include third-party information received by the Secretary, in addition to
that solicited by the Secretary. Third, some comments appeared to be based on misunderstandings of what was actually
in the NPRM. For example, a few commenters expressed concern about the absence of a particular provision that was,
in fact, included in the NPRM. Fourth, several comments appeared to be directed toward specific practices of currently
recognized accrediting agencies that commenters believed violated either the proposed regulations or what the
commenters believed to be established accrediting practices. In general, these comments are not discussed here,
but Department staff will investigate these complaints as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of agencies.

General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters
opposed to the proposed regulations believed that the NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance of responsibilities
among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative data collection
and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the entire higher education community.
Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported to do. In general,
these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations to determine
if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and are included
in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they believed, would
ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The more specific concerns of commenters opposed to the proposed regulations may be summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed regulations are overly prescriptive and excessive in detail and either exceed the statutory authority
of the Secretary or significantly expand the statute beyond Congressional intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed regulations will force institutions to engage in excessive and duplicative information gathering
and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information available to the
public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' already scarce resources away from their primary mission
of providing a quality education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed regulations compromise the integrity of accreditation as a voluntary system of peer review and institutional
improvement; they dilute the focus and purpose of accreditation by requiring accrediting agencies to assume responsibilities
that are more appropriate to the State or Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed regulations will create undue, duplicative, and costly burdens on accrediting agencies for which
they will receive no reimbursement from the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The proposed regulations give the Secretary approval authority over accrediting agencies' standards, which
commenters believe is expressly forbidden by the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly
on vocational institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to receiving comments in opposition to the proposed regulations, the Secretary received many comments
supportive of the NPRM. Some commenters, for example, believed the accreditation process needed a major overhaul,
that accrediting agencies were far too secretive in their actions, and there was genuine need for substantially increased
accountability of accrediting agencies to students and the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage
all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect
the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common
methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations
in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations
on institutions and accrediting agencies, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping and
reporting requirements. Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations, not
just to institutions and accrediting agencies but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern
of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the
manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility
to determine the appropriate means to carry out those responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Secretary has responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating much of what was perceived as
excessive detail in the NPRM, thus providing accrediting agencies more flexibility to meet a particular requirement
in the manner that best suits their needs and the needs and individual circumstances of the institutions or programs
they accredit. At the same time, however, the Secretary has increased the accountability of agencies, as, for example,
by strengthening the requirements that accrediting agencies must have effective standards and must monitor institutions
or programs carefully for continued compliance with those standards. The final regulations make it quite clear that
the Secretary regards accrediting agencies as having primary responsibility for educational quality, but they
also make it clear that the Secretary holds accrediting agencies accountable for the quality of the institutions
or programs they accredit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating a number of the specific reporting and
recordkeeping requirements the proposed regulations would have imposed on both accrediting agencies and institutions
and by allowing agencies and institutions to work together to determine realistic requirements for reporting and
recordkeeping. At the same time, the Secretary holds agencies accountable for the effectiveness of those requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes this overall approach retains the principal strength of the current accrediting system_a
system of peer review that focuses on the unique mission of each institution or program and that fosters educational
improvement consistent with that mission_but effectively addresses the concerns with the current system that Congress
raised when it created the Program Integrity Triad to strengthen institutional oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To illustrate the effect of this overall strategy, the Secretary offers as an example the changes to &sect;602.26,
Required accreditation standards. This section now contains only the statutory language for the 12 required standards.
In this ``minimalist'' approach, the regulations achieve the objectives of Executive Order 12866. By no longer requiring
institutions to provide annual audits to accrediting agencies, the regulations reduce the paperwork burden on both
accrediting agencies and institutions at the same time they remove a major source of costly duplication of effort
by accrediting agencies and the Department. By allowing agencies flexibility in establishing standards for the
12 required areas, the regulations minimize any added costs to institutions necessitated by the new requirements.
Accrediting agencies are no longer required to establish and maintain costly and duplicative systems for collecting
and maintaining specific information about the institutions or programs they accredit. Now agencies may tailor
their systems to the mission, needs, and circumstances of those institutions or programs and the students they serve.
The overall effect of the changes to this one section of the regulations is to reduce cost, reduce burden, reduce paperwork,
reduce duplication of effort, and free accrediting agencies and institutions to focus on the quality of education
in all its manifestations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that there is a potential risk with this strategy, however. By giving accrediting agencies
maximum flexibility in these regulations, by giving SPREs corresponding flexibility in the regulations for the
State Postsecondary Review Program, and by retaining authority for the Secretary to set specific requirements implementing
the certification process, the danger exists that institutions will be burdened with reporting requirements that
are similar, but not identical, thus increasing not only the reporting requirement but the recordkeeping requirement
and cost as well. For this reason, the Secretary strongly urges a coordinated approach to any reporting requirement
that may be imposed on institutions by the regulations implementing the Program Integrity Triad. Specifically with
respect to accrediting agencies, the Secretary urges agencies to impose reporting requirements on the institutions
or programs they accredit only after they carefully examine any publicly available information related to those
requirements, any similar reporting requirements imposed on institutions by either the Department or the State
Postsecondary Review Entities under the State Postsecondary Review Program, and any methodologies currently used,
or mandated for use, by institutions in calculating the required information. The Secretary hopes that by bringing
this potential risk of increased burden on institutions to the attention of the entire higher education community_without
specifically addressing it in regulation_the community can work together to prevent undue burden at the same time
it ensures proper accountability. The Secretary expects to take a leadership role in implementing a coordinated
strategy to manage the triad, with the goal of maximizing effectiveness while minimizing burden, duplication, and
inconsistencies among accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As several commenters raised the issue of Secretarial approval authority over an accrediting agency's standards,
the Secretary believes it is necessary to respond. It is the Secretary's belief that section 496(a) of the HEA statute
gives the Secretary explicit approval authority over an agency's standards in the context of the Secretary's overall
responsibility for determining whether the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training
offered by the institutions and programs it accredits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with regard to the issue of whether the regulations properly focus on vocational institutions, the Secretary
wishes to note that Congress found abuses in all sectors of higher education, not just the vocational sector. For this
reason, the regulations apply to all institutions, with the exception of the requirement of unannounced inspections
to institutions that provide vocational education.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary received several comments about the requirement that Secretarial recognition is now limited to those
accrediting agencies that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose
of enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either
by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies. In general, commenters expressed concern that the requirement would
cause many of the currently recognized specialized or programmatic accrediting agencies to lose recognition. Commenters
believed that failure to include these agencies on the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies was counter
to the purpose of the list, which they believed was to inform the public of those accrediting agencies that the Secretary
determined to be reliable authorities as to the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs
they accredit. Commenters also believed that, in general, institutional accrediting agencies did not examine in
depth the individual programs offered by an institution and that the only assurance of the quality of these programs
was provided by the programmatic agencies that accredited them. It was suggested by some commenters that the Federal
purpose would be better served if the specialized or programmatic accrediting agencies and the institutional accrediting
agencies worked together to assess the quality of education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged a broad interpretation of the phrase ``for other Federal purposes'' in section 496(a) of HEA to
include a whole range of benefits that accrue to the Federal Government by virtue of the Secretary's recognition of
an accrediting agency, including the use of an individual's graduation from a program accredited by a nationally
recognized accrediting agency for entry-level qualifications for Federal employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that the language in &sect;602.1(b)(1) and (2) was misleading because the purpose
of accreditation was not to enable institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in Federal programs.
A number of these commenters provided specific suggestions for amending the language to address this concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary received a suggestion to reorganize this paragraph so that it, rather than &sect;602.3, provided
a summary of the recognition requirements an accrediting agency must meet in order to be recognized by the Secretary.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary acknowledges that the many fine programmatic accrediting agencies currently on the list of nationally
recognized accrediting agencies provide an excellent measure of quality assurance in their respective fields of
specialization. However, section 496(m) of the HEA makes it clear that the Secretary may recognize only those agencies
that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling those institutions
or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either by the Secretary or by other
Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not believe that the broader interpretation of the phrase ``for other Federal purposes'' in section
496(a) suggested by the one commenter is legally supportable because section 496(m) clearly defines the purpose
an agency's accreditation must serve it if is to be recognized by the Secretary, namely the agency's accreditation
must enable the institutions or programs it accredits to establish eligibility to participate in Federal programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that the purpose of accreditation is not to enable institutions or programs to establish
eligibility to participate in Federal programs but rather to publicly recognize those institutions or programs
that meet an accrediting agency's standards for educational quality. The Secretary appreciates the various suggestions
for clarifying this in the regulations and has changed these regulations accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary appreciates the suggestion for reorganizing this paragraph to summarize the recognition
requirements and believes it is helpful.

 The word ``qualifications'' in the definition, which is the same definition as that used in previous regulations,
does not refer to either policies or procedural requirements. Rather, it refers in general to the various requirements
for accreditation that an accrediting agency might have. For example, an institution located in New York might meet
all of the accreditation standards of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), but it is ineligible
for accreditation by NEASC because it is not located in New England.

 One commenter felt the definition could be strengthened to ensure that agencies had a variety of useful sanctions,
the application of which were not automatically appealable under &sect;602.28(a)(5). Another felt that the term
should be uniformly defined by all accrediting agencies to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding arising from
the use of different definitions.

 For purposes of these regulations, the Secretary has defined the term ``adverse accrediting action'' to include,
as a minimum, those actions initiated by an accrediting agency that result in an institution or program losing its
accreditation. However, the Secretary believes accrediting agencies should be free both to define other actions
they consider to be adverse accrediting actions and to establish other sanctions that are not automatically appealable
by the institution or program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, commenters expressed concern that the definition of ``branch campus'' was inconsistent with its use
in &sect;602.27 and that there was no statutory basis for including ``additional locations'' in the requirement
for special actions by accrediting agencies when an institution opened a branch campus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 498(j) of the HEA, the Secretary is charged with defining the term ``branch campus'' for purposes of Title IV
of the HEA. Generally, when the Secretary defines a term, the term is defined in the same manner for any and every Title
IV, HEA purpose. Accordingly, the Secretary adopted the definition of the term ``branch campus'' that was proposed
in the Institutional Eligibility regulations, 34 CFR Part 600, in the proposed accreditation regulations. However,
the Secretary realized that particular definition was too narrow to carry out the purposes of sections 496(c) (2)
and (3) of the HEA, under which an institution that establishes a branch campus must file a business plan with its accrediting
agency and the agency must conduct a site visit at the branch campus within six months of its establishment. Therefore,
in &sect;602.27 of the NPRM, the Secretary imposed the requirements relating to branch campus on ``additional locations''
as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For program and administrative reasons, the Secretary has determined to keep the narrow definition of the term ``branch
campus'' in the Institutional Eligibility regulations. However, the Secretary has adopted a different definition
of ``branch campus'' for these regulations because that different definition is more in keeping with the statutory
requirements of section 496(c). The Secretary believes this different definition is preferable because it provides
assurances to students who enroll at any location of an institution that offers a substantial portion of an educational
program that the location has the resources to operate, and is operating, in compliance with accrediting agency standards.

Change:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition has been revised to include locations that meet the definition of this term in 34 CFR 600.2, which is
basically the same definition as in the NPRM, and any other locations at which an institution offers at least 50 percent
of an educational program. Section 602.27 has been revised to eliminate any reference to ``additional location.''

 The Secretary received numerous comments on the definition of this term and the corresponding term, ``vocational
education.'' Many commenters believed there was no statutory basis for the distinctions in the NPRM and that the use
of the term improperly targeted a particular segment of higher education for burdensome and unwarranted sanctions.
Among commenters who expressed an opinion on the various definitions under consideration, responses were divided.
Some preferred a definition that excluded any type of vocational education that led to a degree, while others felt
the definition should include all prebaccalaureate vocational education regardless of the credential awarded.

 The Secretary believes that members of the governing board of affiliated non-profit institutions can make valuable
contributions to an accrediting agency but should not do so in the capacity of a representative of the public. The Secretary
also believes the exclusion of spouses, parents, children, and siblings of employees of affiliated institutions
is appropriate and that the exclusion ought to extend to close relatives of other individuals listed in the definition.
On the other hand, the Secretary believes students, who are the consumers in this instance, and their families can
serve a useful role as representatives of the public.

The requirement that accrediting agencies have standards for teach-out agreements is specified in section 496(c)(4)
of the HEA and is independent of any Department regulation that may or may not be in effect regarding teach-out agreements.
The Secretary believes the inclusion of provisions for what constitutes equitable treatment of students under a
teach-out agreement is a useful addition to the regulations but believes these provisions should be included in &sect;602.27(b)(6),

The Secretary received numerous comments on the definition of this term and the corresponding term, ``prebaccalaureate
vocational education.'' Many commenters preferred a broad definition that treated all institutions offering any
type of vocational education the same way. Others preferred a definition that excluded programs leading to any type
of degree. Some commenters suggested a definition similar to that in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act. Others suggested different approaches to the issue, including the use of the term ``nonacademic education
program,'' which they defined to be the opposite of an academic education program, as they believed that term was defined
in the Department's clock hour/credit hour regulations. Still others preferred a definition that restricted the
term to institutions whose predominant offerings were vocational, with ``predominant'' defined to mean more than
75 percent of an institution's offerings. Almost all commenters preferred that the same definition be used in both
the accreditation and SPRE regulations.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has carefully considered all comments received on this issue, as well as those on the broader issue of
the burden these regulations would impose on institutions and accrediting agencies. While the Secretary agrees
that it would be best if these regulations and those for the State Postsecondary Review Program used both the same term
and the same definition of that term, the Secretary is aware that the statute uses the term ``vocational education''
for accreditation and ``vocational program'' for the State Postsecondary Review Program. Consequently, the Secretary
believes the appropriate term for the accreditation regulations is ``vocational education'' and for the SPRE regulations
``vocational program.'' However, despite the difference in the specific term used, the Secretary believes that
the definition of both terms should be the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has examined all of the proposed definitions for the accreditation and SPRE regulations and believes
that the IPEDS glossary definition of an ``occupationally specific program'' most closely meets the needs of both
regulations. The Secretary has modified this definition slightly, however, to meet the specific needs of accreditation
and the State Postsecondary Review Program. Thus, in the accreditation regulations, the term ``vocational education''
is defined to be an instructional program, below the bachelor's level, designed to prepare individuals with the skills
and training required in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to the instructional program. The identical
definition is used in the SPRE regulations for a ``vocational program.'' While the definition differs slightly from
the exact wording in the IPEDS definition, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the list of occupationally specific
programs provided by IPEDS defines the instructional programs that, if offered by an institution, cause the institution
to be subject to unannounced inspections by the institution's accrediting agency, as specified in &sect;602.24.

A few commenters expressed concern about the requirement in section 496(a) of the HEA that accrediting agencies whose
accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA must be
administratively and financially separate from and independent of any related, associated, or affiliated trade
association or membership organization. These commenters believed that this requirement would force many agencies
to undergo a major restructuring simply to come into technical compliance with this provision despite the fact that
there was no evidence their present structure in any way compromised the integrity of their accrediting decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also received some comments about the provisions for a waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirements.
Most of these were directed to specific circumstances that exist, or might exist, in the case of a particular accrediting
agency seeking a waiver. The Secretary also received a suggestion that accrediting agencies should have to seek the
waiver each time they applied for recognition, or renewal of recognition, by the Secretary.

With regard to the waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirements, the Secretary believes the specific
circumstances described by various commenters about a particular accrediting agency should be addressed in the
context of that agency's application for the waiver, not through regulation. The Secretary accepts the suggestion
to stipulate in regulation that an agency must seek a waiver each time it applies for recognition or renewal of recognition.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received numerous comments that the proposed requirement in &sect;602.4(e)_that an accrediting
agency had to submit to the Secretary, upon request, information to assist the Secretary in resolving problems with
any institution or program accredited by the agency_exceeded the statute and failed to distinguish adequately between
public and private information maintained by accrediting agencies. Commenters generally believed that this requirement
put accrediting agencies in the position of being required to do the Secretary's work and threatened to compromise
the inherent value of the peer review system on which accreditation is based. Some of these commenters believed that
&sect;602.4(e) should be deleted in its entirety, while others suggested that the information to be provided by accrediting
agencies should be restricted either to the accreditation status of an institution or program or to the minimum information
needed to fulfill the intent of the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not all commenters were opposed to &sect;602.4(e), however. Some supported it as written. Some stated their opinion
that the less confidential information accrediting agencies kept the better. Several of these commenters suggested
that a protocol be developed for the sharing of information and that there should be a single office within the Department
that served as contact with accrediting agencies for the purpose of information sharing. One commenter suggested
that accrediting agencies be given time to negotiate a new understanding of the information sharing concept with
institutions because, as important as the concept was, it was generally in conflict with most agencies' policies
on confidentiality. One commenter, while expressing general support for information sharing, cautioned against
requiring information to be shared before it was confirmed in fact, the institution had received due process, and
any applicable appeals were complete. Many commenters suggested that a possible solution that would allow the Secretary
access to the information the Secretary needed without placing agencies in the position of doing the Secretary's
work was the use of an administrative subpoena by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of general concern to all commenters on the issue of information sharing was the kind of information shared by an accrediting
agency about an accredited institution or program that would be obtainable by anyone under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the comment in the NPRM that the Secretary was considering adding to this section a requirement that
an accrediting agency must refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General any fraudulent activities it discovers
on the part of an institution or program it accredits, provided that institution or program participates in Title
IV, HEA programs, the Secretary received strong support for the general concept but some concern about agencies'
liabilities should the institution or program be subsequently found not to have engaged in fraud. Commenters also
urged the Secretary to substitute for the term ``fraud,'' which has a very precise legal definition, something more
general like ``substantial wrongdoing'' or ``serious abuse.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, several commenters noted that there was no provision in the proposed regulations that paralleled the proposed
requirement in 34 CFR part 667 that the Secretary notify the State postsecondary review entity of Federal actions
against an institution. Commenters also suggested that the State postsecondary review entity should be required
to notify an accrediting agency of the outcome of any review of an institution accredited by the agency that it makes
under the State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is aware that most accrediting agencies currently have confidentiality policies that prevent them
from releasing information about an accredited institution or program to a third party without the prior approval
of the institution. The Secretary is also aware that confidentiality is an important aspect of the peer review system
on which accreditation is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Secretary notes that under section 487(a)(15) of the HEA, by entering into a Title IV, HEA program participation
agreement, an institution acknowledges the authority of the Secretary, accrediting agencies, State postsecondary
review entities, and others to share with each other information pertaining to the institution's eligibility to
participate in Title IV, HEA programs and any information on fraud or abuse by the institution. Therefore, institutions
can have no genuine expectation that information they provide to their accrediting agencies pertaining to their
Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, fraud, or abuse will be kept confidential from the Secretary or these other
entities. Accordingly, the Secretary has revised &sect;602.4(e) to reflect that statutory provision. Thus, the
information the Secretary may request from an accrediting agency under &sect;602.4(e) is limited to information
concerning an accredited or preaccredited institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities,
including its eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs. As a result, an agency does not have to provide
the Secretary with copies of an institution's self-study report, reports of on-site evaluations of the institution
by the accrediting agency, or other documents maintained by the agency about the institution for the purpose of determining
the institution's compliance with the agency's standards. However, the agency must provide any information contained
in those documents that is relevant to the institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities.
The Secretary notes that, as discussed in connection with &sect;602.10, an accrediting agency must provide any document
the Secretary requests relating to whether the agency is complying with the requirements of this part.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary appreciates the suggestion to develop a protocol for information sharing. As this suggestion relates
to the Secretary's management of a regulatory provision, however, it does not need to be addressed in regulation.
The Secretary intends to work with agencies to develop an appropriate protocol for information sharing, which will
address the concerns raised about both the types of information releasable under a FOIA request and a central point
of contact within the Department for the exchange of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges the difficulties in requiring accrediting agencies to report ``fraud'' or ``suspected
fraud.'' As the statutory provision for information sharing specifically refers to fraud and abuse, however, the
Secretary has added a provision to &sect;602.4 that requires agencies to notify the Secretary if they have reason
to believe that an institution may be engaged in fraud or abuse. The Secretary has also added a provision requiring
agencies to notify the Secretary if they have reason to believe an institution or program is not meeting its Title IV,
HEA program responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges the importance of sharing with accrediting agencies information about Federal actions
against accredited institutions but believes that information sharing goes beyond the cases identified by commenters
to include notification to agencies when an accredited institution is referred for review under the State Postsecondary
Review Program. The Secretary also acknowledges the importance of having the State postsecondary review entity
notify accrediting agencies of the results of its reviews but believes this requirement is more appropriately placed
in 34 CFR Part 667 rather than 34 CFR Part 602. The Secretary notes that an accrediting agency's responsibility for
notifying State postsecondary review entities about its decisions is discussed in &sect;602.29 of these regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Section 602.4(e) has been revised to indicate that any agency must comply with the Secretary's request for information
that is related to the institution's or program's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, including
its eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary has removed the limitation on an agency's
duty to share information only in those situations where it does not conflict with accrediting agencies' policies
on confidentiality. A requirement has been added that an accrediting agency must notify the Secretary if the agency
has reason to believe an institution or program is not meeting its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities or is engaged
in fraud and abuse. A new section (&sect;602.5) has been added outlining the Secretary's responsibilities for notifying
accrediting agencies of Federal actions against accredited institutions or programs or referral of institutions
to States under the State Postsecondary Review Program.

Comments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Secretary received many comments that the statute only allows the Secretary access to an accrediting agency's
records, personnel, and facilities, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the application and review process,
not during the entire recognition period. Some commenters described the Secretary's access as so broad that it constituted
unwarranted search and seizure without probable cause. Some commenters were especially concerned about the possible
release under a FOIA request of an agency's confidential materials that Department personnel examined as part of
the Secretary's evaluation of an agency's application for recognition. With regard to the provision for unannounced
visits by the Secretary, the Secretary received suggestions both to limit and not limit the use of these visits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary received a number of comments that the application process and related recordkeeping requirements
were particularly burdensome on accrediting agencies and that the burden reported in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grossly underestimated the burden imposed by the regulations. Other commenters, however, believed that the application
and recordkeeping requirements were not in any way burdensome and that the Secretary was requesting only the minimum
amount of information needed to determine whether an agency was a reliable authority as to the quality of education
or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the suggestion in the NPRM that the Secretary was considering allowing agencies to provide a simple
statement of assurance that they complied with the requirements for recognition so as to reduce the burden on agencies
applying for recognition, there was mixed reaction. Some commenters welcomed the simplification as a reduction
in burden, but others thought it invited abuse and provided no protection of the public interest. Still others felt
that the first review of an agency under the new regulations should be extremely thorough, but thereafter the simple
assurance approach was reasonable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Secretary received a request to include in the regulations the provision contained in the statute that
the Secretary shall give priority for review to those agencies whose institutions participate most extensively
in Title IV, HEA programs and those agencies that are subject to the most complaints or legal actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Secretary believes that the statute requires the Secretary to ensure that recognized accrediting agencies
stay in compliance with the requirements for recognition throughout the recognition period. Consequently, the
Secretary believes the statute authorizes the Secretary to have access to an accrediting agency's records, personnel,
and facilities not only during the application and review process but throughout the recognition period as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding concerns about possible release of confidential agency materials under a FOIA request, the Secretary
wishes to assure agencies that there are provisions under FOIA that protect most of the types of information the Secretary
expects to obtain from agencies for purposes of &sect;602.10(b). For example, if the Secretary determined that an
accrediting agency's actions with respect to three institutions clearly demonstrated the agency's failure to comply
with the recognition requirements, the Secretary would not be required to release the names of the three institutions
under a FOIA request. The Secretary would, of course, identify the institutions to the accrediting agency so that
the agency would have a clear understanding of the basis on which the Secretary reached the determination that it failed
to meet the criteria for recognition. While the Secretary will protect confidential agency materials to the full
extent allowed under FOIA, the Secretary wishes to make it clear that this does not prevent the Secretary from using
those materials against an agency should the Secretary determine that the agency is in violation of the criteria for
recognition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding unannounced visits by the Secretary, which are authorized by the statute, the Secretary believes the use
of such visits is a managerial decision and need not be regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the overall burden reported in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Secretary wishes to note that the estimate was based in part on information provided to the Secretary by various
accrediting agencies as to the time required to complete an application and to meet other requirements contained
in the NPRM. It was also based on the assumption that the Secretary would adopt the simple assurance approach described
in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with regard to both the use of a simple assurance statement to simplify the application process and the inclusion
of a set of review priorities, the Secretary believes these relate to the management of the recognition process and
do not need to be addressed in regulation. The Secretary wishes to make it clear, however, that it is the Secretary's
intent to minimize the overall burden to agencies through a simplification of the entire application process.

Comments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Section 602.11(b)(2) of the proposed regulations provided that the Secretary's evaluation of an agency should
include a review of information directly related to the institutions or programs accredited by the agency, as this
information relates to the institution's or program's compliance with the agency's standards, the effectiveness
of those standards, or the agency's application of those standards. The Secretary received a number of comments that
supported this provision. In general, these commenters felt that it was important for the Secretary to monitor the
extent to which individual agencies continued to accredit institutions that engage in fraud or abuse, particularly
abuse of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary received many more comments, however, that this provision was inappropriate
and also redundant, given the provisions contained in &sect;602.11(b)(1)(i-iii). These commenters also believed
the provision gave the Secretary approval authority over an agency's accreditation standards, which, in their opinion,
was contrary to the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also received some comments related to the sharing of information used by the designated Department
official to reach conclusions regarding an agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition. In general,
these commenters wanted the regulations to specify time frames for an agency's written response to the Department
staff analysis concerning its application for recognition, to require the designated Department official to share
with the agency all information used in reaching a decision about the agency's application, to require the Department
to forward to an agency written reports on any announced or unannounced site visits, file reviews, or other reviews
of the agency, and to allow the agency the opportunity for response to all these reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a number of commenters suggested that the regulations should include a requirement that the Secretary must
publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when an accrediting agency is being considered for recognition and must also notify the State postsecondary review
entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Secretary believes that the designated Department official's review of information directly related to institutions
or programs accredited by an agency is central to the issue of whether the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality
of the institutions of programs it accredits. Therefore, this provision must be retained. The Secretary notes that
any information provided by the agency in accordance with &sect;602.4(e) of these regulations may also be reviewed
by the designated Department official during any evaluation of the agency for compliance with the requirements for
recognition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the suggestion for including various time frames in this section, the Secretary appreciates the concerns
that led commenters to request time frames and, consequently, agrees to include them in this section. The Secretary
does not believe that agencies should have the right to receive a written report after every monitoring activity conducted
by the designated Department official as these activities are conducted for the general purpose of gathering information
about an agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and, in that sense, are ``predecisional.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is already a requirement, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, that the Secretary must publish an
announcement of each Advisory Committee meeting, including those at which accrediting agencies are considered
for recognition, but the Secretary acknowledges the importance of making that practice clear in these regulations.
The Secretary also acknowledges the importance of notifying the State postsecondary review entities whenever an
agency is being considered for recognition.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters objected to the provision that the Secretary could decide to recognize an agency even if it did not
meet all of the requirements for recognition, provided the Secretary determined that the noncompliance did not impair
the agency's effectiveness. These commenters were particularly concerned that an accrediting agency that failed
to meet a particular requirement might be recognized even though the reasons it failed to meet that requirement were
within its control to correct. Other commenters, however, commended the Secretary's willingness to determine the
appropriateness of a waiver when an agency's noncompliance with one or more requirements for recognition did not
limit the effectiveness of the agency. To these commenters, the Secretary's flexibility was a demonstration that
the Secretary sought a working partnership with accrediting agencies that was based on performance and trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to an appeal of an Advisory Committee recommendation, some commenters felt that the 30-day time frame
was too short. Other commenters requested that, in addition to the designated Department official and the agency,
third parties be allowed to contest an Advisory Committee's recommendation concerning the recognition of an agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, several commenters felt that the regulations should contain a time frame for the Secretary to make a decision
regarding an agency's application for recognition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Secretary appreciates the concern of the commenters about granting recognition to an agency that does not
meet all of the requirements for recognition, the Secretary believes that some flexibility is needed so that the Secretary
may grant recognition to an agency that fails to meet all of the requirements, even if the circumstances are within
the agency's ability to control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands the concerns raised about the 30-day time frame for appealing an Advisory Committee recommendation.
However, the Secretary wishes to note that an agency already has two opportunities prior to the Advisory Committee's
recommendation during which it may state its case as to why a negative recommendation concerning its application
for recognition is unwarranted. First, the agency may respond in writing to a negative recommendation by the designated
Department official before that recommendation is forwarded to the Advisory Committee. Second, agency representatives
have an opportunity to appear in person before the Advisory Committee to argue against a negative recommendation.
Because of these two opportunities, the Secretary does not believe the 30-day time frame after the Advisory Committee
makes its formal recommendation is unrealistic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to third parties appealing an Advisory Committee recommendation, the Secretary believes that the appropriate
place for third-party comment is before the Advisory Committee reaches its decision on a recommendation, not after.
With regard to a time frame for the Secretary's decision, the Secretary believes that this is appropriately a management
issue and does not need to be specified in regulation.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received a suggestion from several commenters that any agency subject to the limitation, suspension,
or termination of its recognition should be allowed to challenge the membership of the subcommittee that conducts
a hearing on its case if, in fact, a subcommittee, rather than the full Advisory Committee, hears the case. Commenters
believed a challenge should be allowed on the grounds of either conflict of interest or lack of expertise in either
the type of agency subject to the action or its scope of accrediting activity. The Secretary also received a suggestion
that the subcommittee should consist of five, rather than three, members and another suggestion that all negative
actions recommended by the subcommittee should be discussed and acted upon by the full Advisory Committee. One commenter
suggested that an agency, rather than the Secretary, should be allowed to select members of the subcommittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary received several comments that the 30-day frame for an agency to respond to the designated
Department official's notice of intent to limit, suspend, or terminate the agency's recognition was too short.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the seriousness of the situation that would prompt the use of a subcommittee rather than the full Advisory Committee,
the Secretary accepts the suggestion to expand its size. However, the Secretary believes the same seriousness that
necessitates the use of a subcommittee demands prompt resolution by the subcommittee. Similarly, the Secretary
does not accept the suggestion that the agency should be allowed to choose members of the subcommittee. Regarding
an agency's right to challenge the composition of the subcommittee, it is the Secretary's intent to appoint to the
subcommittee individuals who have no known conflict of interest. However, the Secretary acknowledges that there
may be instances unknown to the Secretary in which a conflict of interest may exist with a subcommittee member. For
this reason, the Secretary believes a challenge to the membership of the subcommittee on grounds of conflict of interest
is warranted. The Secretary does not believe that a challenge on the basis of lack of expertise is justified because
the members of the Advisory Committee from which the membership of the subcommittee is chosen have general expertise
in the areas that come under the purview of the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the 30-day time frame for responding to a notice of intent to limit, suspend, or terminate recognition,

One commenter felt that this section was unnecessary because agencies can always appeal to the courts. Other commenters
expressed concern that the NPRM did not provide for a meaningful appeal of adverse recognition decisions, as required
by the statute. These commenters generally suggested using an intermediate administrative appellate body, such
as an administrative law judge, to hear appeals. Other commenters supported the provision as written, fearing that
an alternative administrative process within the Department would deplete the Department's resources inappropriately.

The Secretary continues to believe, as described in the NPRM, that there can be no administrative appeal within the
Department of a Secretarial decision since the Secretary, as head of the Department, makes all final decisions on
behalf of the Department. The only appeal is through the courts. The Secretary wishes to note, however, that an agency
for which the Advisory Committee recommends denial of recognition is afforded an opportunity to contest that recommendation
before the Secretary reaches a final decision. To delay the Secretary's final decision by adding still another layer
of appeal is, in the Secretary's opinion, unwarranted.

Any accrediting agency, including a State, is free to define the geographic area for which it seeks recognition. In
granting recognition, the Secretary defines the geographic area included in the agency's scope of recognition,
which may or may not be the full geographic area requested by the agency. The Secretary bases the decision regarding
the agency's geographical area of recognition on whether the agency is a reliable authority regarding the quality
of education provided by the institutions it accredits throughout its geographic region.

 A number of commenters described the recordkeeping burden imposed by the proposed regulations as unduly onerous
and in violation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines that limit record retention requirements to
three years. Several commenters indicated that the requirement to keep self-study reports for two complete accreditation
or preaccreditation cycles was especially burdensome because of the large volume of materials typically included
with these reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On other issues related to this section, one commenter felt that, to avoid conflicts of interest, members of the agency's
decision making body should not also be members of the agency's governing board. Another believed that the Secretary
should not have authority to determine whether an agency's staff is adequate, knowledgeable, and competent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With regard to the record retention requirement, the Secretary wishes to note that the requirement to keep records
for two complete accreditation or preaccreditation cycles first appeared in the 1988 regulations governing the
recognition of accrediting agencies. The NPRM for those regulations had initially included a provision for the indefinite
retention of records. This was subsequently reduced to the current two-cycle requirement as a result of public comment
on the recordkeeping burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also wishes to note that the specific comment about the burden of keeping self-study reports for two
full cycles was made by negotiators during the negotiated rulemaking sessions for these regulations. As a result,
the Secretary carefully monitored the review of self-study reports by Department staff members conducting file
reviews at agencies' headquarters during the past year and has determined that only the most recent self-study reports
are particularly useful to staff. Consequently, the recordkeeping requirement for self-study reports has been
reduced to the most recent report only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the potential conflict of interest when the same individuals serve as members of both the decision making
body and the governing board of an agency, the Secretary appreciates the concern but believes that agencies should
be allowed the flexibility to determine the composition of these bodies that best suits their needs. Further, as all
agencies are required to have adequate policies dealing with conflicts of interest, the Secretary believes there
is adequate protection of the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the issue of the Secretary's review of an agency's staff, the Secretary believes that the adequacy, knowledge,
and capability of an accrediting agency's staff are appropriate factors to be considered in making a determination
regarding whether the agency has the administrative responsibility to carry out its accrediting activities.

 Several commenters requested that accrediting agencies be required to demonstrate that their policies, evaluation
methods, and decisions are accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. Their rationale
was that acceptance by recognized agencies provided an important measure of an agency's reliability.

 The commenters' rationale was presented to the Department by the non-Federal negotiators during negotiated rulemaking,
and the Secretary acknowledges that demonstration of acceptance by recognized accrediting agencies can be an important
factor to consider when evaluating an agency seeking recognition, particularly one seeking initial recognition.
On the other hand, those interested in forming new accrediting agencies have expressed concern that this requirement
imposes unfair hurdles for them and unduly stifles competition among accrediting agencies. The Secretary believes
that agencies should not be required to demonstrate acceptance by recognized accrediting agencies but may certainly
do so in their application for recognition, if they wish.

 The Secretary received several suggestions for changes to this section. For example, one suggestion was to change
the wording in &sect;602.23(a) from ``[the agency] consistently applies and enforces written standards that ensure
that the quality of education or training offered is of sufficient quality to achieve&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the
stated objective for which it is offered'' to ``[the agency] has written standards that it consistently applies to
ensure that the education or training offered&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Another was to change the wording in
&sect;602.23(b)(5) from ``to ensure that its criteria and standards are appropriate and sufficiently comprehensive
to evaluate the quality of the education of training provided&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;and are relevant
to the education or training needs of affected students'' to ``to ensure that its criteria and standards are comprehensive
and appropriate to the agency's objective of ensuring the quality of the institutions or programs it accredits.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary also received a number of comments directed to the requirement that agencies must have a systematic
program of review to ensure what in previous regulations was described as the ``validity and reliability'' of its
standards. Some commenters believed the wording in the NPRM was preferable to the phrase ``validity and reliability''
because of the various technical interpretations often given to those words. Others, however, found the wording
in the NPRM vague and generally not as strong as the original wording. All commenters, regardless of their concerns
about the specific wording, agreed that the requirement was exceedingly important in assessing whether the agency
is a reliable authority as to educational quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, several commenters requested that the limit on preaccreditation status be extended from five to six years
to accommodate some agencies' practice of granting preaccreditation for six years and then reviewing the preaccredited
institution or program every two years during the six-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes that the various wording changes suggested by commenters for &sect;602.23, of which two are
described above, substantially reduce the effectiveness of the section by shifting the emphasis away from agencies'
overall responsibility to have effective standards that ensure educational quality. With regard to the request
that the maximum preaccreditation period be lengthened to six years, the Secretary understands the rationale presented
by those agencies that conduct very thorough, and in some cases on-site, reviews of preaccredited institutions or
programs throughout the preaccreditation period. However, the Secretary notes that not all agencies follow this
practice of conducting thorough on-site reviews throughout the preaccreditation period. In these instances, the
Secretary believes that the addition of another year of preaccreditation is not justified. For this reason, the Secretary
does not accept the suggestion to extend the maximum preaccreditation period to six years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ``validity and reliability'' issue, the Secretary has carefully considered all of the comments,
especially those directed to the level of technical and statistical precision that is often associated with the words.
However, in light of the Secretary's decision to list the twelve required accreditation standards in &sect;602.26
as they appear in the law, with no elaboration, the Secretary believes the strongest possible language is necessary
in this section to make very clear the importance of this requirement in establishing sound accreditation standards.
For the same reason, the Secretary believes it is necessary to add to this section a requirement that an agency must
demonstrate that each of its standards provides both a consistent basis for determining the educational quality
of different institutions and programs and a valid measure of the aspects of educational quality that it is intended
to measure.

 The Secretary received numerous comments about the provision pertaining to unannounced site visits, most of which
were directly related to the definitions of ``prebaccalaureate vocation education'' and ``vocational education.''
Many commenters preferred that unannounced visits be restricted to those institutions offering non-degree vocational
education, while others felt that all institutions offering vocational education, regardless of the credential
awarded, should be subject to the requirement. Many commenters suggested that the term ``institution that offers
vocational education'' should be restricted to those institutions whose predominant offerings are vocational.
The word ``predominant'' was defined by these commenters to mean more than 75 percent of an institution's course offerings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also believed that the purpose of the unannounced site visit as stated in the NPRM_to determine
whether or not the institution or program continued to be in compliance with the agency's standards_was inappropriate.
One commenter wanted the regulations to require accrediting agencies to publish clear guidelines for when and how
an agency will conduct an unannounced visit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary has carefully considered all comments received on this issue, as well as those on the broader issue of
the burden these regulations would impose on institutions and accrediting agencies. The Secretary has also reexamined
the House-Senate Conference Report regarding the requirement for unannounced inspections of institutions that
offer vocational education. This report describes the House language as requiring unannounced inspections of institutions
that are predominately vocational in nature, while the Senate language speaks more generally of requiring these
inspections for all institutions that offer vocational education. As this report also notes that the House deferred
to the Senate on this issue, the Secretary believes it is the clear intent of Congress to require accrediting agencies
to conduct unannounced inspections at all institutions that offer vocational education or training. The Secretary
also believes that Congress' use of the term ``inspection'' rather than ``review'' or ``evaluation'' is evidence
that the purpose of the unannounced visit is not necessarily to conduct a full review of the institution but to determine
whether, at a minimum, the institution actually has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have,
or appeared to have, either during its last evaluation by the accrediting agency or in subsequent reports to the agency.
The Secretary wishes to point out that an accrediting agency has the flexibility to determine how best to carry out
these unannounced inspections in a manner that achieves the purpose of these inspections but minimizes the cost to
institutions and the burden to accrediting agencies. The agency also has the flexibility to examine, during the unannounced
inspection, other aspects of an institution, such as whether it maintains adequate records or whether it actually
provides the programs and support services it advertises. As agencies are responsible for monitoring institutions
throughout their accreditation period, as described in &sect;602.24(b)(4), the Secretary wishes to point out that
these unannounced inspections can and should serve a useful purpose in helping agencies meet this responsibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received numerous comments regarding this section. Many commenters felt that there was no substantive
change requirement in the statute so the requirement should be eliminated from the regulations. Other commenters,
however, cited a different reason why the requirement should be eliminated: most accrediting agencies already have
substantive change policies so there is no need for the Department to regulate the content of those policies. A host
of commenters observed that, as worded, the requirement placed an undue reporting requirement on both accrediting
agencies and institutions and an unnecessary burden on agencies by requiring them to grant prior approval to even
the most insignificant of program changes or additions. Many also noted that the prior approval process would severely
inhibit institutions' ability to respond in a timely manner to changing needs, as, for example, in health-related
fields. Finally, commenters noted that many programs, such as those in community colleges, were routinely reviewed
and approved by various State review boards before they could be offered, so requiring additional prior approval
by accrediting agencies would only increase costs without any added benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary firmly believes that an agency cannot be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training
offered by an institution if the agency does not have a substantive change policy that requires prior approval by the
accrediting agency before a substantive change can be included in the agency's grant of accreditation to an institution.
At the same time, the Secretary acknowledges the burden the requirement proposed in the NPRM imposed on institutions
and accrediting agencies. While the least burdensome approach would be to allow agencies simply to use their existing
substantive change policies to meet this requirement, the Secretary believes this is unworkable and does not adequately
protect the public interest because there is considerable variation among agencies as to what constitutes substantive
change. Furthermore, as the NPRM documents, there have been several significant abuses in this area because of an
agency's unwillingness to evaluate an institution's substantive change before including that change in the institution's
grant of accreditation. Consequently, the Secretary believes that the Federal interest, as well as the interest
of the general public, is best protected if a common core of changes that must be considered substantive is defined
in regulation. To determine what should constitute this common core, the Secretary examined the topics institutional
accrediting agencies typically include in their list of substantive changes that require prior approval and has
included in this section only those that reflect the Secretary's principal concerns regarding institutions that
undergo substantive change. The Secretary believes that the revised substantive change policy, which now applies
only to institutional accrediting agencies, considerably reduces the burden on both accrediting agencies and institutions
at the same time it provides adequate protection to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that there are many variables that must be taken into account in determining the type of review
that an agency conducts before granting prior approval to an institution's substantive change. For this reason,
the Secretary has decided to give accrediting agencies the flexibility to determine the procedures they will use
in granting prior approval to an institution's substantive change. In some instances, this may involve a full-scale
on-site evaluation of the entire institution. In others, it may involve a focused visit to examine the particular
circumstances surrounding the change. In still others, it may involve simply a thorough review by agency staff of
the institution's report on its ability to implement the substantive change without adversely affecting the institution's
ability to continue to meet the agency's standards.

The Secretary received numerous comments about the required accreditation standards. Most commenters felt that
the Federal government should not mandate how accrediting agencies defined their standards. They also felt that
the proposed regulations intruded on the autonomy of accrediting agencies, exceeded the statute, and were contrary
to Executive Order 12866. In their opinion, the Secretary overreached his authority by specifying anything in this
section that went beyond a mere restatement of the law on the required standards. These same commenters applauded
the removal of the language on curricula, faculty, facilities, equipment and supplies, and student support services
that had appeared in early drafts of the proposed regulations and urged the Secretary to do the same for the other eight
standards specified in the law.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that many of the specific responsibilities assigned to accrediting agencies by the various
standards would force agencies into becoming government regulators. They also argued that these new requirements
would require accrediting agencies to duplicate the efforts of the Department and the States and would substantially
increase the paperwork burden on institutions and accrediting agencies. In their opinion, these requirements would
be so burdensome to accrediting agencies in terms of time and personnel that they would shift the focus of accreditors
away from their primary function_that of reviewing educational quality_to a role in which they served merely as investigative
and enforcement agencies for the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the opinions expressed above were shared by the majority of commenters on this issue, they were by no means unanimous.
Some commenters from the proprietary sector, for example, had no serious objection with the standards, noting that
most of what was contained in the standards was already being examined to the degree of specificity contained in the
proposed regulations by either their accrediting agencies, the State, or both. Others commenters felt that the standards,
as written, protected students as well as Federal dollars. One commenter thought the introductory paragraph to the
required standards section should be strengthened by requiring agencies to have quantitatively validated standards
that were based on a rigorous assessment of the value added by the education or training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter expressed concern that the Secretary was exceeding the statute by requiring institutional
accrediting agencies whose accreditation does not serve Title IV, HEA purposes to meet the student outcomes requirements
of &sect;602.26(b)(9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has given very careful thought to all the concerns raised with regard to this section. Of particular
concern to the Secretary is how best to achieve an appropriate balance between the need for agencies to have rigorous
standards in order to protect students' interests and the need for agencies to have flexibility in addressing these
standards in order to reduce cost and burden to both agencies and institutions. Another important factor, in the Secretary's
opinion, is the need to build a partnership among triad members that is based on mutual trust and allows each member
the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry out its responsibilities under the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering all of these factors, the Secretary has decided to eliminate all but the statutory language for
each of the 12 required standards. This approach eliminates many requirements that commenters found especially
burdensome, such as that in &sect;602.26(b)(4) concerning annual financial audits. In addition, it allows accrediting
agencies that already have rigorous standards in these areas to continue operating as they have, thus eliminating
the need for additional cost to agencies and institutions to comply with the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Secretary believes it is appropriate not to prescribe specific minimum regulatory standards elaborating
on the standards in the statute, the Secretary also believes that the standards contained in the NPRM provide a sound
framework for a thorough assessment of these areas. For this reason, the Secretary summarizes below the major provisions
contained in the NPRM concerning the statutory standards. The Secretary believes these provisions are appropriate
for agencies to address in their own standards for these areas. In addition, the Secretary believes that, in addressing
the development of their own standards, accrediting agencies should consider any comparable Title IV, HEA program
standards and any relevant and applicable State standards developed under the State Postsecondary Review Program.
However, the Secretary wishes to make it clear that this does not prevent an accrediting agency whose standards do
not include all of these provisions from being recognized by the Secretary, provided the agency can justify the appropriateness
of its standards as reasonable applications of the statutory standards in light of its needs, the needs and circumstances
of the institutions or programs it accredits, and the students they serve. Finally, the Secretary wishes to emphasize
the importance of accrediting agencies' developing their standards in such a way that they minimize burden, overlap,
and duplication at the same time they ensure overall educational quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that for most of the standards discussed below there are comparable, or very similar, standards
in section 494 and some in 498 of the HEA. The Secretary expects to take a leadership role in working with accrediting
agencies and SPREs to ensure that the standards for all three members of the triad are complementary, rather than redundant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the overall quality of an institution's
or program's fiscal and administrative capacity. The assessment should examine in particular whether the institution's
or program's finances are sufficiently strong to enable it to meet, and appear likely to continue to meet for the foreseeable
future, all of the agency's standards for accreditation. The assessment should also include some provision for the
ongoing monitoring of an institution's or program's finances throughout any period of accreditation or preaccreditation
granted by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(5) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard and sections 498
(c) and (d) of the HEA contain comparable Department standards.

Success with respect to student achievement in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the success of an institution
or program in meeting its educational objectives, as measured by the achievement of its students. Typically under
this standard, an agency should require the institution or program to document and assess the educational achievement
of students in verifiable and consistent ways, such as student grades, grade point averages, theses or portfolios,
the results of admissions tests for graduate or professional school or other standardized tests, transfer rates
to institutions offering higher level programs, job placement rates, completion rates, results of licensing examinations,
evaluations by employers, follow-up studies of alumni, and other recognized measures of educational outcomes.
The agency should also typically require the institution or program to use effectively the information obtained
in this manner to improve student achievement with respect to the degrees or certificates offered. Finally, the agency
should typically monitor in a systematic way the institution's or program's performance with respect to student
achievement, including, as appropriate, completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing
examinations, or other appropriate measures of occupational competency, to determine if performance is consistent
with both the institution's or program's mission and objectives and any measures the agency may have for institutions'
or programs' performance with respect to student achievement. For programs that provide vocational education,
agencies should establish quantitative standards for completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State
licensing examinations.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's default rates
in relation to the institution's overall ability to meet the agency's standards. Typically, an agency might evaluate
an institution to determine whether the institution is out of compliance with its accrediting standards if the institution's
latest cohort default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students program equals
or exceeds 25 percent or if it has increased significantly in relation to its rate the previous year. Under this standard,
an agency is not expected to do the work of the Federal government with respect to institutional default rates. Rather,
the agency is expected to review the default rate information provided by the Secretary, determine if that information
calls into question the institution's compliance with agency standards, and take follow-up action as appropriate.

review student complaints that relate to the agency's standards and take appropriate follow-up action with regard
to those complaints. If necessary, the agency would refer complainants to appropriate Federal, State, and other
agencies if the complaints do not relate to the agency's standards. Finally, it would require institutions or programs
to make available to students the agency's mailing address or telephone number for complaints.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's compliance
with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities in relation to the institution's overall ability to meet the agency's
standards. The agency's assessment under this standard is based on program reviews, financial and compliance audits,
audited financial statements, and any other information that the Secretary provides. Under this standard, the agency
is not expected to do the work of the Federal government in reviewing institutions for compliance with their Title
IV, HEA program responsibilities. Rather, the agency is expected to review the information provided by the Secretary,
determine if that information calls into question the institution's compliance with agency standards, and take

With regard to the concern raised by one commenter about the need for quantitatively validated standards, the Secretary
notes that &sect;602.23(b)(5) requires agencies to have in place a program for the systematic evaluation of the validity

for the required standards, this ``validity and reliability'' provision takes on added importance, as described
in the discussion of the changes to &sect;602.23.

Finally, with regard to the concern about extending the requirement to have a standard assessing student achievement
to institutions whose accreditation does not serve Title IV, HEA program purposes, the Secretary wishes to note that
the overriding concern of the statute, as expressed in section 496(a) of the HEA, is that accrediting agency standards
must contain a measure or measures of student achievement. Therefore, it is the Secretary's belief that extending
the requirement to all agencies, not just those whose accreditation serves Title IV, HEA purposes, is warranted.

 Many commenters objected to the inclusion of this requirement in the regulations on the grounds that section 496(g)

required by section 496. This point was argued by non-Federal negotiators during negotiated rulemaking as well.

 The Secretary has carefully reviewed the statutory provision on which this requirement was based and has also reexamined
the requirement in light of refund policies established in the Student Assistance General Provisions, 34 CFR part
668. It is the Secretary's belief that the regulatory language contained in 34 CFR part 668 is sufficient by itself
to ensure that an institution's refund policy meets the requirements of the statute. Thus, there is no need for a requirement
that accrediting agencies must have a standard that assesses institutions' refund policies.

 Many commenters expressed concern about the proposed 18-month time limit for institutions to come into compliance
with an accrediting agency's standards. Some argued that in many instances, such as when an institution's financial
situation is cause for concern, it takes considerably longer for an institution to come into compliance. Others argued
that, for some programs, 18 months was too long. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Many commenters expressed concern about the requirement under consideration that accrediting agencies would have
to take adverse action if they determined that an institution was unlikely to continue to be able to meet agency standards
for the foreseeable future. This requirement, they argued, was totally unrealistic because agencies would have
no objective basis on which to make such a determination. According to these commenters, the requirement would result
in a determination that was pure conjecture on the part of accrediting agencies and would leave agencies vulnerable
to lawsuits. Several commenters expressed an opposing view about this requirement, however, stating it was necessary
to protect students who attended institutions whose ability to continue to provide a quality education was clearly
questionable.

 The Secretary believes that some definitive time frame is necessary to ensure that institutions and programs make
serious efforts to improve the quality of their offerings and to ensure that accrediting agencies take adverse actions
when institutions fail to make those efforts. However, the Secretary also recognizes that, because of differing
lengths of programs, the 18-month time frame is unrealistic for all types of institutions.

With regard to the provision that agencies should be required to take action if it appears that an institution or program
will be unlikely to continue to meet an agency standard, the Secretary understands the concerns of commenters who
opposed the requirement. However, because there is potential for serious harm to students enrolled in an institution
or program the quality of whose education or training appears to be declining, the Secretary remains concerned about
a marginal institution or program that might be accredited by an agency despite the agency's very serious concerns
about its enrollment or financial trends. While the Secretary has not added to these regulations the specific requirement
under consideration in the NPRM, the Secretary wishes to impress upon agencies the importance of the requirement,
contained in &sect;602.24(b)(4) of these regulations, that they monitor institutions and programs throughout
any accreditation or preaccreditation period to ensure that they give prompt and serious attention to any degradation
in an institution's or program's ability to provide a quality education.

: The Secretary received many comments about the special actions accrediting agencies are required to take whenever
institutions establish new branch campuses. Of particular concern to most commenters was the apparent inconsistency
between the definition of ``branch campus'' in &sect;602.2 and the use of that term in this section. Also of concern
to many commenters was the added requirement that accrediting agencies must visit ``additional locations,'' which
many felt went beyond the statute. One commenter felt that the required submission of a business plan for a new branch
campus was unwarranted, burdensome and costly and had no intrinsic value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also received a number of comments about the requirement that accrediting agencies provide an opportunity
for public comment about an institution's or program's qualifications for accreditation. Many felt this would subvert
the accreditation process by evoking unjustified complaints. Others felt it required the agency to hold a public
hearing every time an institution or program was evaluated for accreditation or reaccreditation. One commenter
held an opposing view, however, preferring that agencies be required to hold public hearings for all accrediting
decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

With regard to the issue of public comment when an institution or program is being considered for accreditation, the
Secretary believes there should be opportunity for such comment but that there need not be a public hearing to obtain
it. The Secretary believes further that an agency should be free to determine both the manner in which it publicizes
that an institution is scheduled for review and the method it uses to obtain public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the other public disclosure issues in this section, the Secretary believes that the more open an accrediting
agency is with regard to its policies and practices, as well as the individuals involved in its accrediting activities,
the better it is for the consumer. However, the Secretary believes it is best left up to the agency to determine its actual
practice in this regard.

: One commenter expressed concern that the proposed regulations allowed an accrediting agency to deny an institution
or program the right to appeal in person any adverse accrediting action. Another commenter noted that the regulations
did not address the provision in section 496(e) of the HEA that prohibits the Secretary from recognizing the accreditation
of an institution unless the institution agrees to submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or
termination of the institution's accreditation to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action. This same
commenter felt that accrediting agencies should be required to adopt an initial arbitration procedure for handling
disputes involving the loss of accreditation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With regard to the commenter's concern that institutions have the right to appeal an adverse action in person, the
Secretary believes it is best to give agencies the flexibility to determine the appropriate procedures for appealing
adverse actions. As the cost to an agency when an institution or program appeals an adverse action is generally substantial,
the Secretary believes this approach minimizes the cost without causing undue harm to institutions that are subject
to an adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the issue of arbitration, the Secretary recognizes that the statute does not specifically require
an accrediting agency to agree to binding arbitration. However, the Secretary anticipates that many accrediting
agencies will agree to arbitration since it significantly limits the cost and length of appeals of their final decisions.
Moreover, if an accrediting agency does not agree to binding arbitration, an institution will be free to appeal a final
adverse decision by the agency in the federal courts.

The Secretary received several comments endorsing the addition of a requirement that an accrediting agency must
notify the Secretary and the appropriate State postsecondary review entity of any final adverse accrediting action
at the same time the agency notifies the institution or program. On another issue, most commenters believed it was
inappropriate to require an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary and others prior to making a final decision
that involved the denial or termination of accreditation, although some supported this provision. Some commenters
believed that the time frame for requiring accrediting agencies to make available to the public the comments of an
institution that loses its accreditation was unrealistic. Finally, one commenter requested clarification as to
which agencies should be included in the phrase ``the appropriate accrediting agencies'' that an agency must notify
of its decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned in the NPRM, the Secretary believes that accrediting agencies should be required to notify the Secretary
and others at the same time they notify an institution or program of a final adverse action in order to prevent excessive
draw-down of Federal funds by the institution or program. The Secretary appreciates the comments received in support
of this position. With regard to the issue of notification before an adverse action is final, the Secretary shares
the concerns of those who support the inclusion of a requirement to this effect but agrees with those commenters who
expressed the concern that notification prior to final action could cause serious harm to institutions that subsequently
had the adverse action reversed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the 60-day time frame for obtaining the comments of an institution or program that is subject to a final
adverse action, the Secretary believes it is in the best interest of the public to publish as soon as possible the reasons
why the agency has denied, withdrawn, suspended, or terminated the accreditation of the institution or program.
If the institution or program chooses not to make its comments about that action available to the accrediting agency
within 60 days, then the accrediting agency is free to publish its statement of reasons without the accompanying statement
of the institution or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to ``appropriate accrediting agencies,'' the Secretary believes that accrediting agencies should
be free to determine which agencies should be notified but that, at a minimum, an agency should notify all recognized
agencies that accredit an institution, or a program offered by the institution, if the agency takes an adverse action
against the institution or one of its programs.

The Secretary received many comments opposing the requirement that institutional accrediting agencies must review
their accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution if a programmatic accrediting agency takes adverse action
against a program offered by the institution. Some commenters also expressed opposition to the requirement that
programmatic accrediting agencies had to review an accredited program at an institution if the institutional accrediting
agency took adverse action against the institution. Many commenters objected to the phrase ``or should have known''
in &sect;602.30(b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that all agencies, including those that accredit only programs, should be required to take
into account the decisions of States and other accrediting agencies when making any accreditation or preaccreditation
decision involving an institution or program. The Secretary also believes that there may be occasions when a programmatic
agency is the first agency to discover a serious problem that threatens the overall ability of the institution to provide
a quality education. For this reason, the Secretary believes it is important for an institutional accreditor to review
an institution for compliance with its accreditation standards if a programmatic agency takes adverse action against
a program offered by the institution. The Secretary allows the institutional accrediting agency the flexibility
to determine what an appropriate ``review'' is, however. It does not have to be a full on-site review of the institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to agencies being accountable for actions about which they ``should have known,'' the Secretary understands
the concerns of commenters that agencies could be held accountable for knowing about the actions of another agency
that failed to inform other agencies of its adverse actions. However, there are instances where information about
an agency's adverse action against an institution or program becomes a matter of public record, and the Secretary
believes that in these instances accrediting agencies should not be absolved from their responsibility to review
the institution simply because another entity failed to notify them.

 Notice published March 22, 1994, 59 FR 13606, the Secretary requested comments on the procedures that should be established
to implement the statutory amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary indicated in the Notice that he intended to issue regulations establishing procedures for schools
to appeal their default rates based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. The notice solicited
public help in developing those procedures. The Secretary invited public comment on any aspect of implementing the
statute, but in particular, the Secretary solicited comments on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What procedures should the Secretary use in determining whether to exclude from the calculation of cohort default
rates loans, the inclusion of which due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete
calculation of a school's cohort default rate?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. What procedures should be used for sampling of loan servicing and collection records?

3. What procedures should the Secretary provide for schools to review the information provided by the guaranty agencies
to the Secretary for use in determining cohort default rates prior to calculation of the final rates? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary received 54 comments in response to the request for comments. Many of the comments are reflected in these
rules. The Secretary's response to the suggestions made by the commenters that were not accepted is provided after
the following discussion of the procedures established by these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Appeals Based on Allegations of Improper Loan Servicing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208 added section 435(a)(3) to the HEA to specifically provide certain institutions with an
opportunity to appeal the calculation of their cohort default rates on the basis of allegations of improper loan servicing
or collection. In particular, this opportunity will be available to institutions that: (1) Are subject to loss of
eligibility for the FFEL Program under section 435(a)(2) of the HEA; (2) are subject to loss of eligibility for the
Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program under section 428A(a)(2) of the HEA; or (3) have cohort default
rates that equal or exceed 20 percent for the most recent year for which data are available. The statute requires the
Secretary to take steps to ensure that these institutions have access to a representative sample of relevant loan
servicing and collection records for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 calendar days. Upon completion
of the appeal, the Secretary will reduce an institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted
loans in the sample that are required to be excluded under section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208 also amended section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to clearly provide that the Secretary would
consider allegations of improper loan servicing or collection only in considering appeals of cohort default rate
determinations filed by institutions. This change was made in response to certain court rulings which suggested
that the Secretary was required to determine whether loans were properly serviced prior to making initial determinations
of and releasing cohort default rates. Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA now provides that, in considering appeals
of cohort default rates under section 435(a)(3) of the HEA, the Secretary should exclude any loans which, due to improper
servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the institution's timely
appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations establish the procedures for implementing the appeal process provided by sections 435(a)(3)
and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. The regulations specify that an institution which is subject to the loss of participation
in the FFEL program because of default rates equal to or in excess of 25 percent for the three most recent years for which
rates are calculated or which has a cohort default rate which equals or exceeds 20 percent may appeal the calculation
of the rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. These regulations do not specifically
include institutions that are subject to the loss of participation in the Federal SLS Program because that program
has been repealed by Congress effective July 1, 1994. See Public Law 103&hyph;66, section 4047(b) and (d). These regulations
replace the former regulatory provision which related to the loss of SLS participation because that subsection becomes
moot on the elimination of the SLS program. However, an institution that is currently subject to a loss of participation
in the SLS program will have the opportunity to pursue an appeal under these procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these regulations, once an institution receives notice from the Secretary that its cohort default rate or rates
exceed the levels specified in section 435(a)(3) of the HEA, the institution will have 10 working days to initiate
an appeal of the rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. The Secretary's default rate
notification to the institution will include a list of all borrowers included in the calculation of the cohort default
rate. To initiate an appeal, the institution must include the list of borrowers in its notification to the guaranty
agencies that it is appealing the calculation of the cohort default rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing
or collection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the guaranty agency receives the institution's appeal, it must provide the institution with the loan servicing
or collection records for a representative sample of the loans insured by the guaranty agency and included in the institution's
cohort default rate. The sample must be identified by the guaranty agency and the universe estimate derived from the
sample results must be acceptable at a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval.
In some cases, the result may be that servicing and collection records for all the loans guaranteed by the agency and
included in the institution's default rate will be sent to the institution. Once the sample is identified, the guaranty
agency must send the loan servicing and collection records to the institution within 15 working days of receiving
the institution's request. The guaranty agency's response to the institution must also include a list of certain
dates that will assist the institution in reviewing the records and the Department in resolving the appeal. An agency
may charge the institution a reasonable fee for copying and production of the records, not to exceed $10 per borrower
file. The Secretary will charge a similar fee in response to a request for records maintained by the Department on behalf
of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving the records from the guaranty agency, the institution has 30 calendar days to file its appeal with
the Secretary. The regulations identify the material that must be submitted by the institution. The Secretary will
review the appeal and issue a decision. The Secretary will assume that the records maintained by the guaranty agency
in the normal course of business in the FFEL Program are correct unless the institution provides substantial evidence
to the contrary. If the Secretary finds that the evidence submitted by the institution shows that some of the loans
included in the sample of loans should be excluded from calculation of the cohort default rate, the Secretary will
adjust the institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans that should be excluded.
The Secretary will use a statistically valid methodology to determine the estimate of the number of loans that should
be excluded from the calculation of the cohort default rate and the confidence interval of the estimate. In determining
the exact methodology, the Secretary will need to consider the number of loans in the sample, the number of guaranty
agencies involved and other appropriate factors. The Secretary will notify the institution, in writing, of his decision
on the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA includes two prerequisites for exclusion of a loan from the cohort default rate calculation.
Under the law, the institution must prove both (1) that the loans were serviced or collected improperly and (2) that
the improper loan servicing and collection caused the student loan default. If either of these two requirements is
not proven, the loan will not be excluded from the cohort default rate calculation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations reflect the Secretary's view, based on consideration of past appeals of cohort default rate determinations
that, for purposes of a cohort default rate appeal, a loan is considered to have been serviced or collected improperly
only if, under applicable rules, the Department would decline to pay reinsurance on the principal of the loan by reason
of the improper servicing or collection. The HEA does not define the term ``improper servicing or collection'' used
in section 435(m). Therefore, to determine what constitutes improper loan servicing and collection, the Secretary
looks to its due diligence regulations, its published policies such as Appendix D to 34 CFR part 682 and other applicable
policies and practices. There is no indication that the 1993 amendments to section 435(m) were intended to establish
new concepts regarding what does and does not constitute improper loan servicing and collection. For that reason,
the Secretary construes section 435(m) by reference to concepts developed over a period of years in the administration
of the FFEL Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 435(m) of the HEA also specifies that a loan which has been subject to improper servicing or collection is excluded
from calculation of the cohort default rate only if the default on the loan was ``due to'' improper servicing or collection
and results in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. The statute does not explain how
improper servicing or collection could cause a cohort default rate to be inaccurate or incomplete. In

987 F.2d 821, 830 (D.C. Cir. 1993), however, the Court of Appeals assumed that a cohort default rate would be inaccurate
or incomplete if it contained loans which defaulted due to improper servicing or collection. The Secretary considers
that interpretation to be reasonable. The Court of Appeals in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Atlanta College
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also concluded that the type of causal link between improper servicing and default on a loan is properly left to the
Secretary. The Secretary believes that a stringent showing of default causation is appropriate. Section 435(m)
of the HEA does not include any general ``causation'' challenge that would permit an institution to appeal the calculation
of its default rates on the basis that its students defaulted for reasons beyond the institution's control. Moreover,
Congress set tight constraints on the time periods for challenges to the calculation of the cohort default rates and
clearly did not contemplate a time-consuming, heavily burdensome process for determining default causation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these factors, the Secretary has determined that section 435(m) should be interpreted to allow only a limited
loan servicing challenge. Accordingly, these regulations reflect the Secretary's determination that, for purposes
of the calculation of a cohort default rate, improper servicing or collection is considered to have caused a default
only if the improper servicing or collection resulted in a lack of notification to the borrower that he or she must begin
repaying the loan. The Secretary believes that once the borrower has been informed of the obligation to repay the loan,
the institution cannot show that a resulting default was due to the alleged improper servicing. The position reflected
in these regulations has its genesis in certain decisions of the Secretary which resolved appeals of cohort default
rate determinations on a case-by-case basis. Case-by-case adjudication is a permissible approach to decision making
under applicable law. See

416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974). However, the Secretary's adjudications resolving individual appeals have not established
rules of general applicability. As explained in more detail in the comment and response section of this document,
the Secretary has considered a variety of proposed standards for adjudication of appeals based on allegations of
improper servicing and collection. Some of these approaches would arguably broaden the appeal standard for institutions,
while others reflect a more narrow scope than is reflected in the Secretary's adjudications to date. After careful
consideration of these alternatives, the Secretary concludes that the general construction of section 435(m) of
the HEA reflected in his most recent appeal decisions faithfully implements Congressional intent and fairly balances
the rights of all those affected by those decisions. The Secretary particularly invites comments as to whether there
are other types of improper servicing that should be considered to have ``caused'' a default for purposes of calculation
of a cohort default rate and the rationale for any such suggestion. Review of cohort default rate information.

Public Law 103&hyph;208 also amended section 435(m)(1)(A) of the HEA to provide, effective October 1, 1994, that
institutions will have an opportunity to review and correct errors in the information provided by the guaranty agencies
to the Secretary for use in calculating cohort default rates. These regulations add paragraph (h) to &sect;668.17
to establish procedures for this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations, the Secretary will provide each institution which has a draft default rate equal to or in excess
of 20 percent with a copy of the records provided by each guaranty agency in regard to loans made to borrowers for attendance
at the institution which were insured by that guaranty agency. Institutions with draft default rates under 20 percent
may request copies of the records. These records will be accompanied by a notice indicating the institution's draft
default rate. This draft default rate will not be considered a final agency decision and will not be otherwise voluntarily
released by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving the information from the Secretary, the institution will have 30 calendar days to review the information
and notify, in writing, the appropriate guaranty agency of any information included in the cohort default rate which
it believes is incorrect. The institution should also send the agency any evidence which it believes supports its
contention that the information provided by the guaranty agency to the Secretary is inaccurate. The guaranty agency
shall review the institution's challenge and respond within 30 calendar days. If the guaranty agency agrees with
the institution, the information used to calculate the cohort default rate will be adjusted prior to the release of
the official cohort default rates. If the guaranty agency does not confirm the error alleged by the institution, the
institution may use the data provided by the guaranty agency as part of an appeal of the calculation of the default rate
based on the allegedly erroneous data after the rates are released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary intends to continue his practice of allowing institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or in excess
of 20 percent for the most recent year for which rates have been calculated to challenge the calculation of the rate
based on allegations that erroneous data were included in the calculation. However, all institutions must satisfy
the time deadlines for filing challenges under the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that section 435 only provides an opportunity for the institution to review and correct errors
in the information provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agency. The statute does not contemplate that all allegations
of error will be resolved prior to release of the final default rates. The regulations, therefore, allow an institution
to appeal the calculation of a cohort default rate based solely on allegations of erroneous data. However, to ensure
that appeals can be decided on a timely basis, the regulations provide that an institution can only base an appeal on
allegations that were raised to the guaranty agency during the review of the draft cohort default rate. The Secretary
believes that this process will benefit the institutions, guaranty agencies and the public by shortening delays
that have been experienced in the appeal process and will result in more timely decisions.

Effect on Pending Default Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received a number of comments regarding the effect of the changes to section 435(a)(3) and (m) on the
current official cohort default rates. As the Secretary noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, Public Law 103&hyph;208 does not specifically provide for reopening prior final determinations. However,
the Secretary has been convinced by the commenters to allow institutions to challenge their current cohort default
rates on the basis of allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. Accordingly, the regulation allows institutions
identified in section 435(a)(3) of the HEA to file an appeal of the current cohort default rates based on allegations
of improper loan servicing. Thus, institutions with cohort default rates equal to or in excess of 20 percent for fiscal
year 1991 (including institutions subject to the loss of SLS participation based on a fiscal year 1991 cohort default
rate in excess of 30 percent) may challenge the 1991 cohort default rate. Similarly, institutions which are subject
to the loss of FFEL program participation based on cohort default rates for fiscal years 1989, 1990 and 1991 may challenge
those rates. The regulation specifies that the time limits for challenging these rates will begin on the date that
the regulations become effective. The Secretary intends to notify institutions of the effective date of these regulations
once that date is determined. The prior default rates will be considered effective until the appeal process is completed
and a new rate issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that cohort default rates for fiscal year 1992 will be issued during the summer of 1994. Institutions
which are interested in challenging their current cohort default rates may want to wait until after the new rates are
issued. An institution with a cohort default rate in excess of one of the threshold levels for fiscal year 1991 may find
that its fiscal year 1992 cohort default rate is below the threshold and that the institution is no longer subject to
sanctions based on excessive cohort default rates. Thus, an institution may want to consider whether filing a challenge
of the current default rates is worth the time, expense and resources needed to prepare and submit an appeal of a rate
that may soon be irrelevant. The Secretary also notes that the regulations provide that once an institution has challenged
a cohort default rate for a particular year and received a final decision from the Secretary, that decision is binding
in any future challenge to the default rate filed by the institution.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters provided a number of different definitions of the term ``improper servicing or collection'' of a loan.
A number of respondents to the request for comments suggested that the Secretary should remove from the calculation
of the cohort default rate any loan that was not serviced in strict compliance with the Department's due diligence
requirements in 34 CFR 682.411. Some commenters suggested that a loan on which a default claim has been paid should
be considered properly serviced or collected on the grounds that a claim would not have been paid if servicing was not
proper. Other commenters suggested that the Secretary should consider a lender's failure to grant a deferment to
be improper loan servicing or collection. Some commenters also suggested that guaranty agency collection efforts
should be considered in evaluating whether improper servicing or collection has occurred.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary's view of the satutory term ``improper servicing or collection'' is discussed earlier in this document.
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that Congress intended to establish a new standard for proper servicing
or collection. Instead, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to rely on the concepts and requirements developed
and applied by the Department over the years. The requirements in &sect;682.411 are designed to ensure that lenders
and guaranty agencies that are requesting Federal benefits meet certain standards in collection as a requirement
for receiving those benefits. These requirements have never been intended to set forth standards which if not followed
in their entirety provide an excuse for borrowers to refuse to repay their loans. Similarly, they are not intended
to provide protection for institutions that fail to meet the statutory requirements for continued participation
in the loan programs. Congress has determined that the institutions bear a significant responsibility for defaults
in the FFEL program. The Secretary does not believe that a lender's failure to strictly satisfy the requirements for
Federal benefits should excuse the institution from the statutory consequences of its high default rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary also does not agree that it would be appropriate to assume that all claims which have been paid as defaults
have been properly serviced or collected. While failure to pay a default claim may be based on a finding of improper
servicing or collection, payment of a default claim is not absolute proof of compliance with the Secretary's requirements.
Accordingly, institutions should have the opportunity to review servicing and collection records relating to these
loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the issue of a lender's failure to respond to deferment requests, the Secretary notes that he has consistently
treated deferment errors as ``erroneous data'' in adjudicating appeals of cohort default rate determinations.
This treatment benefits the appealing institution since a determination that erroneous data was reported results
in the affected loan being removed from the calculation of defaulted loans (the numerator), but it remains in the calculation
of loans in repayment (the denominator). In contrast, loans which are excluded from the calculation of the cohort
default rate based on improper servicing or collection are excluded from both the numerator and the denominator.
The Secretary does not believe there is any reason to change his treatment of deferment errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary notes that guaranty agency servicing is not relevant to the default rate calculation. A guaranty
agency does not begin to service a loan until it has already defaulted and, thus, its servicing does not affect the institution's
cohort default rate.

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Some commenters proposed that the Secretary remove from the calculation of the cohort default rate loans on which
the lender did not request preclaims assistance from the guaranty agency or on which the agency did not provide notice
of the request to the institution.

Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: A lender's failure to request preclaims assistance could, in certain circumstances, be considered improper servicing
or collection if it would result in the loss of reinsurance on the principal of the loan based on the applicable rules
and policies and if the borrower defaulted due to lack of notification that the time for repayment had begun.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters urged the Secretary to allow all institutions to challenge their default rates on the basis of improper
servicing or collection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 435(a)(3) specifically allows only institutions with cohort default rates above certain threshold levels
to challenge their rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing. The Secretary believes that this limitation
was intentional and reasonable in light of the significant burdens placed on guaranty agencies and the Secretary
in reviewing challenges based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection.

The HEA does not require institutions to provide evidence of improper loan servicing or collection prior to filing
a challenge of its cohort default rates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters requested that institutions be required to submit a complete appeal before the guaranty agency is
required to meet the time deadlines required by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These comments were based on the assumption by the commenters that the institution would be required to submit evidence
of improper loan servicing before the guaranty agency would be required to respond to the institution's appeal. Under
these regulations, the institution will only need to notify the guaranty agency that it is appealing the calculation
of the cohort default rate and provide a copy of the list of borrowers included in the calculation of the rate. Accordingly,
the Secretary believes it is unlikely that an institution will not submit a complete notification to the guaranty
agency. However, an institution which does not submit the notice and list to the guaranty agency as required by the
regulation may be barred from pursuing an appeal.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that loans serviced by lenders or servicers who have been designated as exceptional performers
under section 428I of the HEA should not be included in any loans reviewed for improper servicing or collection on the
ground that these loans are presumed to be serviced or collected properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not believe that it is appropriate to exclude loans serviced by exceptional performers from the
process for determining appeals based on allegations of improper servicing or collection. The exceptional performer
designation is related only to the lender's receipt of payments from the guaranty agency. It should not be used to limit
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's opportunity to challenge the calculation of its cohort default rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters urged the Secretary to provide institutions more time to complete and submit appeals to the
guaranty agencies and the Secretary.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that the regulations provide sufficient time for an institution to complete and submit appeals.
The Secretary believes that the regulations are consistent with the tight time constraints on the time period for
appeals included in the HEA.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters recommended that the Secretary consider the quality of education provided by an institution in determining
whether an institution should be sanctioned based on its excessive default rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute sets forth specific grounds for challenges to an institution's cohort default rates. The quality of education
is not included as a basis for appeal of a default rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection.
The Secretary notes, however, that institutions which are subject to the loss of FFEL Program participation under
section 435(a)(2) of the HEA may appeal on the grounds of exceptional mitigating circumstances as defined by the Secretary's
regulations.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters recommended that the Secretary grant an institution's appeal if the guaranty agency does not provide
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing and collection records within the time set forth in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not believe it is appropriate to automatically grant an institution's appeal if the guaranty agency
misses a deadline to provide records to the institution. In most cases, the institution continues to participate
in the program and is not harmed by a short delay. The Secretary believes that the guaranty agencies must take appropriate
steps to provide records within the regulatory time frames. However, in appropriate cases, the Secretary may consider
taking action to levy a financial penalty or limit, suspend or terminate a guaranty agency's participation in the
FFEL program based on violations of the regulatory time frames.

Comment:

One commenter recommended that loans which have been improperly serviced or collected be removed only from the numerator
of the calculation of the cohort default rate but not from the denominator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary construes section 435(a)(3) to require that loans which are determined to have defaulted due to improper
loan servicing or collection be ``exclude[d]'' from the calculation of the cohort default rate entirely.

The contents of this final rule have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the
order, the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the procedures in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the contents of this rule are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the FFEL program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs of these procedures, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these procedures
justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that the contents of this rule do not unduly interfere with State, local and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contents of this rule are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities.

Sections 668.17 (f) and (h) contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for its review. These regulations affect institutions of higher education and guaranty agencies that participate
in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Secretary needs the information to properly administer certain
aspects of that program. The collection and reporting burden for the 300 institutions which challenge the calculation
of their cohort default rates under these provisions is expected to increase by 15,600 hours. The collection and reporting
burden for the 46 guaranty agencies which must respond to the institutions' requests under these regulations is expected
to increase by 2,576 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on the burden estimate must be received on or before May 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that many participants in the FFEL program have an interest in these procedural rules. In
light of that interest, the Secretary is requesting comment on these rules. The Secretary will consider any comments
received within the designated comment period in determining whether to make any changes in these rules. After reviewing
any comments received during the comment period, the Secretary will publish changes to the regulation or will publish
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Waiver of Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.
However, the Secretary has determined that the public interest requires the immediate issuance of this interim final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. section 551, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 procedural amendments to regulations do not require prior public notice and an opportunity for public comment. The
changes being made by this rule do not affect the substantive requirements or the underlying laws or rules; nor do they
modify or revoke existing rights or obligations, or create new ones. These regulations merely establish procedures
to implement the requirements of sections 435(a)(3) and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. Therefore, public comment is not
required under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary has determined that notice and comment is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to
the public interest. The procedures included in these rules are needed to adjudicate appeals from the initial determinations
of cohort default rates for institutions. The Secretary is required by section 435(m)(4) of the HEA to publish cohort
default rates for each institution for which a rate is calculated at least every fiscal year. The cohort default rates
to be released for the current fiscal year are currently scheduled to be released during the summer of 1994. For the
appeal procedures to be in place prior to the release of the default rates, the procedures must be published by May 1,
1994. Moreover, the Secretary invited public comment on what the procedures should be and received and considered
the comments received in preparing this interim final rule. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined that public
comment on this interim final rule is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An institution that is subject to loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section
or has been notified by the Secretary that its cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year
for which data are available may include in its appeal of that loss or rate a challenge based on allegations of improper
loan servicing or collection. This challenge may be raised in addition to other challenges permitted under this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An appeal based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection must be submitted to the Secretary in accordance
with the requirements of this paragraph. The Secretary excludes any loans from the cohort default rate calculation
which, due to improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the
institution's complete and timely appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of
the cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The following procedures apply to appeals from cohort default rates issued by the Secretary during Federal fiscal
year 1994 and subsequent years. Upon receiving notice from the Secretary that the institution's cohort default rate
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or that its most recent cohort default rate equals
or exceeds 20 percent, the institution may appeal the calculation of the cohort default rate based on allegations
of improper loan servicing or collection. The Secretary's notice includes a list of all borrowers included in the
calculation of the institution's cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To initiate an appeal under this paragraph, the institution must notify, in writing, each guaranty agency that
guaranteed loans included in the institution's cohort default rate that it is appealing the calculation of the cohort
default rate. The notification must be received by the guaranty agency within 10 working days of the date the institution
received the Secretary's notification. The institution's notification to the guaranty agency must include a copy
of the list of students provided by the Secretary to the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Within 15 working days of receiving the notification from the institution, the guaranty agency must provide
the institution with a representative sample of the loan servicing and collection records relating to borrowers
whose loans were guaranteed by the guaranty agency and that were included as defaulted loans in the calculation of
the institution's cohort default rate. In selecting the representative sample of records, the guaranty agency must
use the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The guaranty agency shall list in social security number order all loans made to borrowers for attendance at the
institution and guaranteed by the guaranty agency and included as defaulted loans in the calculation of the cohort
default rate which is being challenged by the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) From the population of loans identified by the guaranty agency, the guaranty agency shall identify a sample of
the loans. The sample must be of a size such that the universe estimate derived from the sample is acceptable at a 95 percent
confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval. The sampling procedure must result in a determination
of the number of loans that should be excluded from the calculation of the cohort default rate under this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Once the sample of loans has been established, the guaranty agency shall provide a copy of all servicing and collection
records relating to each loan in the sample to the institution in hard copy format unless the guaranty agency and institution
agree that all or some of the records can be provided in another format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The guaranty agency may charge the institution a reasonable fee for copying and providing the documents, not to
exceed $10 per borrower file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) After compiling the servicing and collection records for the loans in the sample, the guaranty agency shall send
the records, a list of the loans included in the sample, and a description of how the sample was chosen to the institution.
The guaranty agency shall also send a copy of the list of the loans included in the sample and the description of how the
sample was chosen to the Secretary at the same time the material is sent to the institution. The list of loans included
in the sample must include the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) For each loan listed, the last date of attendance, the date entered repayment, the date of the first payment missed
by the borrower and the default date listed in the guaranty agency's records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) After receiving the relevant loan servicing and collection records from all of the guaranty agencies that insured
loans which are included in the cohort default rate calculation, the institution has 30 calendar days to file its appeal
with the Secretary. An appeal is considered filed when it is received by the Secretary. If the institution is also filing
an appeal under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the institution may delay submitting its appeal under this paragraph
until the appeal under paragraph (d)(1)(i) is submitted to the Secretary. As part of the appeal, the institution must
submit the following information to the Secretary:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) A certification by an authorized official of the institution that all information provided by the institution
in the appeal is true and correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Secretary or his designee reviews the information submitted by the institution and issues a decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) In making a decision under this paragraph the Secretary presumes that the information provided by the guaranty
agency is correct unless the institution provides substantial evidence showing that the information maintained
by the guaranty agency is not correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the Secretary finds that the evidence presented by the institution shows that some of the loans included in the
sample of loan records reviewed by the institution should be excluded from calculation of the cohort default rate
under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Secretary reduces the institution's cohort default rate, in accordance
with a statistically valid methodology, to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans in the sample that should be
excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The Secretary notifies the institution, in writing, of the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) An institution may not seek judicial review of the Secretary's determination of the institution's cohort default
rates until the Secretary or his designee issues the decision under paragraph (f)(3)(v) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) For purposes of this paragraph a loan is considered to have been serviced or collected improperly only if, under
applicable rules, the Department would decline to pay reinsurance on the principal of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) For purposes of this paragraph, improper servicing or collection is considered to have caused a loan to default
for purposes of the calculation of the cohort default rate only if the improper servicing or collection resulted in
a failure to notify the borrower that he or she must begin repaying the loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) For cohort default rates issued by the Secretary for federal fiscal years from 1989 to 1991, the procedures in this
paragraph apply, except that the 10-day period for initiating an appeal with the guaranty agency starts on the effective
date of these regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An institution may challenge the calculation of a cohort default rate under this section no more than once. The Secretary's
determination of an institution's appeal of the calculation of a cohort default rate is binding on any future appeal
by the institution. An institution that fails to challenge the calculation of a cohort default rate under this section
within 10 working days of receiving notice of the determination of the cohort default rate is prohibited from challenging
that rate in any other proceeding before the Department.

Review of default rate data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Effective on October 1, 1994, an institution has an opportunity to review and correct the information provided to
the Secretary by the guaranty agencies for the purpose of calculating a cohort default rate on the loans to be included
in the calculation of the institution's cohort default rate before the final rate is calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) (i) Once the Secretary has received the information used in calculating the cohort default rates from the guaranty
agencies, the Secretary calculates draft cohort default rates for each institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary sends all institutions with draft cohort default rates equal to or in excess of 20 percent a copy
of the information provided by the guaranty agencies in regard to loans included in the institution's cohort default
rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An institution with a draft cohort default rate less than 20 percent will receive a notice of the draft default
rate and may request a copy of the information provided by the guaranty agencies within 10 working days of receiving
the notice from the Secretary. Upon receiving the request from the institution, the Secretary will send the institution
a copy of the information requested. The time frames provided in this paragraph will not start until the institution
receives or should have received the information from the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the default rate information from the Secretary, the institution must notify
the guaranty agency of any information included in the default rate data that it believes is incorrect. The institution
must also provide the guaranty agency with any evidence that it believes supports its contention that the default
rate data are incorrect. (3) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the institution's challenge under paragraph (h)(2)
of this section, the guaranty agency shall respond to the institution's challenge. The guaranty agency's response
must include a response to each allegation of error made by the institution and any evidence supporting the agency's
position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The guaranty agency shall provide a copy of its response to the institution to the Secretary and identify any errors
in the information previously submitted to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The information used to calculate cohort default rates will be changed to reflect allegations of error made by
an institution and confirmed by the guaranty agency prior to releasing final cohort default rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The draft default rate issued by the Secretary under paragraph (h)(1) of this section may not be considered public
information and may not be otherwise voluntarily released by the Secretary or the guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) An institution may not appeal a cohort default rate under paragraph (d)(1) of this section on the basis of any alleged
errors in the default rate information unless errors were identified by the institution in a challenge to its preliminary
default rate under paragraph (h) of this section.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary publishes final regulations to implement the State Postsecondary Review Program (SPRP) authorized
under title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). Under the SPRP, the Secretary
enters into an agreement with a State under which the State designates a State postsecondary review entry (SPRE) to
be responsible for conducting or coordinating reviews of institutions of higher education referred to the State
by the Secretary under specific statutory provisions. The purpose of the SPRE reviews is to determine whether those
institutions should continue to participate in the student financial assistance programs authorized under Title
IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs). The SPRE reviews institutions on the basis of State standards developed in consultation
with institutions located in the State. The Secretary reimburses SPREs for costs they incur under the SPRP from appropriated
funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs and many other
Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition
of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution
of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable
authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an
eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level in the State
in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must be certified
by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the framework
for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate''
to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality education or training
worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally
been referred to as ``the triad.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities
of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program
Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized
by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV are specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight responsibility
for States: the State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of responsibilities for
accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions
that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute
for the three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will require leadership in both implementation and evaluation
if it is to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The Secretary will take steps to assure that the various
responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions
that should not be eligible to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the basis of either the quality of education
they offer or their inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the Secretary is committed to carrying out
the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the triad members that are inherent in the statute in a manner
that causes the least burden to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will
review carefully the applications on accrediting bodies and the standards and operating plans proposed by State
Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review Program to insure that they meet the
requirements of the statute and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to fulfill their statutory
purposes. The Secretary will also place a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education Participation
System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, which will contain the information that the Secretary generates
in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary
will use the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn
carry out their responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to the Secretary's effective selection
of institutions for program review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very important key to effective management. The Secretary
will evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department to determine their effectiveness
in improving the integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and will take such steps as may be indicated
to improve the results. Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the advice and counsel of the National
Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the effectiveness of the triad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary
one, with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the
focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs they
accredit. States, in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within the state required for participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria related to institutional
performance in the Title IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is on the administrative
and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the functions and responsibilities of each of the triad members are generally different, the statute does require,
in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary
functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas from different perspectives for different purposes.
For example, all three of the triad members are required to examine the finances of an institution. If each looks at
financial strength from a perspective complementary to that of the others, accrediting agencies would focus principally
on the capacity of the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of quality sufficient to meet accrediting
agency standards and to fulfill the institution's mission over a 5&hyph;10 year period of accreditation. The emphasis
of a review by a SPRE would be on whether or not the institution possesses the full range of resources needed to serve
students currently attending the institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the institution's finance
in light of its ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, to provide
the administrative resources necessary to comply with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all
of its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to
the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically
possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject to three different standards regulating the same
area of operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary
expects accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in establishing their own standards to insure that
varying standards do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also important that accrediting agencies
and States not impose any standard that is weaker than a comparable Title IV, HEA program standard. The Secretary believes
coordination of this is a federal responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the complementary approach to the functions of the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example,
that institutions should not have to develop different methodologies to provide data that the three members of the
triad may require. The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any other requests for data about the
institution, its students, or its graduates should rely on information already in the institution's possession.
To that end, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data based on the methodology
that will be specified in the regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992, or, where the institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, such as a system
designed to provide data to a State higher education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the format
already being used by the institution. Similarly, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the
audited financial statements institutions are now required to provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent
those statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews conducted under their respective standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration,
also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to those included in part H. The suggestion has been made
that the Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of overlap so that institutions would not be subject
to varying standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad members. However, the Secretary interprets
part H as permitting States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, as opposed to using a Federal
standard, and also believes that this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not clear how the requirements
of the different agencies are capatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of these programs administered
by other agencies may be very different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this alternative. The Secretary
does believe that it would be useful to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies that are similar
to those of part H might be coordinated to reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed at the national level should be made available to institutions,
as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In
particular, data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific fields and information concerning graduation
and withdrawal rates at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad members and institutions. The Secretary
will facilitate the development of this type of information and, where possible under the auspices of the Department,
will coordinate the development of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives
of the triad members and institutions to exchange information about the gatekeeping process and to discuss how the
triad is functioning, both in identifying institutions whose performance is questionable and in reporting requirements
that have proven to be unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments concerning the functioning of the
triad, as it is implemented through these and other regulations governed by part H. The Secretary will seek improvement,
where possible, within existing regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to the statute itself
if experience indicates those changes are both necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden,
and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a summary of the significant changes from the NPRM:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.1&blank;Scope and purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 667.1(a)(1) has been revised to clarify that the purpose of the SPRP is to reduce fraud and abuse in the Title
IV, HEA programs. This section also has been revised to clarify that under the SPRP a State's standards apply only to
referred institutions and a State may review only referred institutions under those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.2&blank;Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been revised to maintain a clear distinction between the terms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in view of the changes made to the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A professional program is therefore an undergraduate or graduate educational program that prepares individuals
for an occupation, if that occupation (1) is listed in a Federal classification manual, (2) requires at least a bachelor's
degree to qualify for entry; (3) involves the independent practice or application of a defined or organized body of
competencies that is unique to the occupation; and (4) is formally recognized and regulated under a national or State
licensure, accreditation, or permit system. Also, the definition is expanded to allow a SPRE to use its State's statutory
definition of the term ``professional program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been revised to be consistent with that used in IPEDS. A vocational program is therefore defined as an educational
program that is below the bachelor's level and is designed to prepare individuals with skills and training for employment
in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to that educational program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.3&blank;State agreement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (b)(3) of this section has been revised to clarify the type of records that a SPRE must keep or have access
to, and the type of information that must be provided to the Secretary. Thus, paragraph (b)(3)(iii) has been revised
to indicate that a SPRE must keep or have access to records of referred institutions, related to activities under this
part, and must provide requested information to the Secretary for financial or compliance audits of referred institutions.
Paragraph (b)(3)(iv) has been added to indicate that the SPRE must keep or have access to records relating to its activities
under this part, and must provide such information to the Secretary upon request when the Secretary evaluates the
SPRE's performance under the SPRP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.4&blank;State postsecondary review entity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section has been revised to make clear that the SPRP does not authorize a SPRE to (1) grant State authorization
to provide postsecondary education to an institution, or (2) require nonreferred institutions to comply with the
standards established under &sect;667.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.5&blank;Criteria the Secretary uses to refer institutions to a SPRE for review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The criterion in paragraph (b)(11) of this section has been revised to limit complaints the Secretary considers in
determining whether to refer an institution to a SPRE for review to student complaints. This section has also been
revised to allow an institution an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the information that the Department uses
to refer the institution to a SPRE for review before the Department refers that institution to a SPRE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.6&blank;SPRE selection of institutions for review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section has been revised to allow an institution that has not been referred by the Secretary an opportunity to
challenge the accuracy of the information that a SPRE uses to select the institution for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 667.8&blank;Notice to nationally recognized accrediting agencies of SPRE actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new section is added to these final regulations to require a SPRE to notify the appropriate nationally recognized
accrediting agency before the SPRE conducts a review of an institution the agency accredits. The SPRE is also required
to notify that accrediting agency of significant and relevant decisions, reports, or actions taken as a result of
the review.

program are reasonable given the expected amount of money that the student can earn upon completion of the program
is revised to apply only to vocational programs.

satisfy a SPRE standard does not warrant further SPRE action, to forego any further action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, approximately 1500 parties submitted comments on the proposed
regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is published
as an appendix to these final regulations. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations
to which they pertain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, were identified in the preamble to the
NPRM under the heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 667.3, 667.4, 667.8, 667.12, 667.15, 667.21, 667.22, and 667.26 contain information collection requirements.
As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). These regulations contain records
that will affect States and State postsecondary review entities. An estimate of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping
burden that will result from the collection of the information is 2000 hours per response for 57 respondents for a total
burden of 114,000 burden hours for this package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on this burden estimate should be submitted by May 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

(a)(1) This part establishes the rules and procedures that govern the State Postsecondary Review Program, which
is authorized by title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The purpose of the
program is to reduce fraud and abuse in the title IV, HEA programs through development of State standards for, and State
oversight and review under those standards of, institutions referred by the Secretary under &sect;667.5 or selected
by a State postsecondary review entity under &sect;667.6.

total number of institutions that are certified to participate in all States;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the latest award year for which information is available, determining the percentage of title IV, HEA program
funds by dividing the total amount of title IV, HEA program funds that were made available to students who enrolled

total amount of title IV, HEA program funds that were made available to students, or to those student's parents, who
enrolled in institutions that participate in a title IV, HEA program in all States;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6)(i) Determining which States receive more than $75,000 under the initial distribution; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Calculating the difference between each of those States' initial distribution and $75,000;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Calculating a ``reduction percentage'' by dividing the total amount obtained in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this
section by the total amount obtained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Reducing the initial distribution of each State in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section by the product of the amount
obtained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section and the reduction percentage in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the Secretary determines that a SPRE will not spend its entire allotment during the period for which those funds
are made available, or if a SPRE does not spend its allotment by the end of the period for which those funds are made available,
the Secretary reallots those funds to other SPREs_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

State review standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each State participating under this part must develop standards, in consultation with institutions in the State,
under which the SPRE reviews referred institutions. The State-developed review standards must evaluate, with regard
to a referred institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The extent to which the institution makes available to its students and prospective students its catalogs, admission
requirements, course outlines, tuition-and-fee schedules, refund policy, course cancellation policy, rules
and regulations, and enrollment agreement, if appropriate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the institution's descriptions of its courses and educational programs are accurate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the institution has a method to assess that a student has the ability to complete successfully the educational
program for which he or she applies;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether the institution maintains and enforces standards relating to satisfactory academic progress;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Whether the institution maintains adequate student and other records;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Whether the institution complies with relevant safety, and health standards, such as fire, building, and sanitation
codes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The extent to which the institution's financial and administrative capacity is appropriate to its scale of operations,
and whether the institution maintains adequate financial and other information to determine the adequacy of its
financial and administrative capacity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) For an institution that the SPRE determines is at financial risk, the adequacy of the institution's plans to provide
for, if the institution closes_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Instruction to enrolled students; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Retention of and access to academic and financial aid records;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) If an institution provides a vocational program_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the tuition and fees charged for that vocational program are excessive given the amount of money that a
student who successfully completes the program may reasonably be expected to earn; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether the vocational program provides students with quality training that leads to useful employment in an
occupation recognized in that State. In making this evaluation, one of the factors the SPRE shall consider is the appropriateness
of the length of the vocational program in terms of both the number of days of instruction and the number of credit or
clock hours the program offers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The extent to which the institution provides to its students relevant information regarding_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Market and job availability for students in its occupational, professional, and vocational programs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The relationship between the institution's educational programs and State licensing standards for specific
occupations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The appropriateness of the number of semester, trimester, or quarter credit or clock hours required for the completion
of an educational program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The appropriateness of the length of 600-clock-hour educational programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Whether, and the extent to which, the actions of any owner or shareholder of the institution, or any person exercising
control over the institution may adversely affect its participation in a title IV, HEA program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) The extent to which the institution's procedures for investigating and resolving student complaints are adequate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) The extent to which the institution's advertising promotion, and student recruiting practices are appropriate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) Whether the institution has a fair and equitable refund policy; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) The extent to which the institution's educational programs are successful as measured by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The completion and graduation rates of the students enrolled in those programs, taking into account the length
of the programs and the selectivity of the institution's admission policy (for the purpose of this provision, a completion
rate is the same as a graduation rate);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The institution's withdrawal rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) With respect to the institution's vocational and professional programs, the placement rate of the institution's
graduates in occupations related to their educational programs, with related programs and occupations determined
by reference to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NOICC Master Crosswalk
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Where appropriate, the rate at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The success of the institution's students who express other completion goals, such as transferring to another
institution, obtaining full-time employment in their field of study, or qualifying for military service, in meeting
those goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In developing the review standards in paragraph (a) of this section, a State_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) May establish different standards for different types or categories of institutions or educational programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Shall specify the records and information that a referred institution would need to maintain to demonstrate
to a SPRE the institution's compliance with those standards; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a referred institution was not, before the institution was referred, otherwise required to keep records relating
to its compliance with State review standards, and did not keep those records, must allow the institution a reasonable
period of time to obtain those records to enable the institution to demonstrate its compliance with the State standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except for standards regarding prospective students in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall establish standards
that apply at least to all regular students;

by establishing_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Criteria under which a SPRE determines if the tuition and fees charged by an institution for a vocational program
are excessive compared to the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program may reasonably
be expected to earn;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Acceptable completion and graduation rates of students enrolled in educational programs offered by an institution;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An acceptable withdrawal rate of students at an institution;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(v) An acceptable rate or rates at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Shall determine the extent to which it is appropriate to base a State review standard on a related title IV, HEA program
standard or requirement or establish as the State's review standard the comparable title IV, HEA program standard
or requirement.

(1) The State does not comply with, or provide adequate information regarding, the provisions in paragraph (a) of
this section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of that State;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State does not submit evidence that the State's review standards were developed in consultation with the institutions

(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the Secretary refers an institution to a SPRE for
review under &sect;667.5 or the SPRE selects an institution for review under &sect;667.6, the SPRE reviews, or arranges
for the review of that institution, to determine whether the institution is in compliance with the State review standards
described in &sect;667.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary may determine that a SPRE need not review an institution that is referred only because it meets the
conditions of &sect;667.5(b)(10) if the SPRE previously conducted a review of that institution and found no violations
of the State's standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The SPRE shall provide written notice to all institutions in the State that participate in a title IV, HEA program
of the review standards approved by the Secretary under &sect;667.22 before it may conduct reviews of referred institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each year the SPRE shall make available information regarding its review priority system after its plan is approved
by the Secretary under &sect;667.13 and before conducting reviews of referred institutions under that plan and priority
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) After a SPRE completes its review of a referred institution, the SPRE must issue an initial report of the SPRE's
findings and provide it to the institution no later than 45 days after the SPRE completes its review. If the SPRE finds
that the institution is in violation of a standard, for each finding, the SPRE must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) Cite the standard violated and the nature of the violation; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, prescribe a course of action the institution must follow
to correct the violation. The SPRE has sole discretion to determine an appropriate period for the institution to correct
the violation and bring itself into compliance with the State's review standards; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a proceeding under &sect;667.25 to affect the termination of the institution's participation in the
title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) The SPRE must give the institution an opportunity to respond to its findings and required actions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The SPRE may determine, based on compelling evidence provided by the institution, that the institution's failure
to satisfy a State standard does not warrant any further action by the SPRE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the institution chooses to respond to the SPRE's report within the time permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE must evaluate
the institution's response and issue a final report to the institution that includes its findings and required action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1)(i) The SPRE must provide to the Secretary a copy of its final report to an institution within 30 days of its issuance
to the institution; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the institution did not respond to the SPRE's initial report by the date permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE must
provide to the Secretary a copy of its initial report. The SPRE's initial report becomes its final report on the day
after the date provided to the institution for responding to that report; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the SPRE did not prescribe a course of action the institution must follow to correct a violation of the State's
standards under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the SPRE must include in its report to the Secretary an explanation
of why no action was prescribed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In addition to the reasons for initiating a proceeding to effect the termination an institution's participation
in a title IV, HEA program under paragraph (c) of this section, the SPRE may determine that the institution should no
longer participate in that title IV, HEA program if that institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does not respond to the SPRE's findings or comply with the SPRE's required actions within the time permitted by
the SPRE, and the SPRE's findings show violations of the State's standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does not allow SPRE personnel at the institution; or

General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters
opposed to the proposed reguations believed that the NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance of responsibilities
among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative data collection
and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the entire higher education community.
Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported to do. In general,
these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations to determine
if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and are included
in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they believed, would
ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, many commenters were concerned that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed regulations will force institutions to engage in excessive and duplicative information gathering
and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information available to the
public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' already scarce resources away from their primary mission
of providing a quality education; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly
on vocational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage
all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect
the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common
methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations
in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations
on institutions and SPREs, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations, not just to institutions and SPREs
but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the
regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities
under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry
out those responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that there is a potential risk with this strategy, however. By giving SPREs maximum flexibility
in these regulations, by giving accrediting agencies corresponding flexibility in the regulations for Secretary's
Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies, and by retaining authority for the Secretary to
set specific requirements implementing the certification process, the danger exists that institutions will be
burdened with reporting requirements that are similar, but not identical, thus increasing not only the reporting
requirement but the recordkeeping requirement and cost as well. For this reason, the Secretary strongly urges a coordinated
approach to any reporting requirement that may be imposed on institutions by the regulations implementing the Program
Integrity Triad. Specifically with respect to States, the Secretary urges SPREs to impose reporting requirements
on referred institutions only after they carefully examine any publicly available information related to those
requirements, any similar reporting requirements imposed on institutions by either the Department or accrediting
agencies under the regulations governing the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting
Agencies, and any methodologies currently used, or mandated for use, by institutions in calculating the required
information. The Secretary hopes that by bringing this potential risk of increased burden on institutions to the
attention of the entire higher education community_without specifically addressing it in regulation_the community
can work together to prevent undue burden at the same time it ensures proper accountability. The Secretary expects
to take a leadership role in implementing a coordinated strategy to manage the triad with the goal of maximizing effectiveness
while minimizing burden, duplication, and inconsistencies among SPREs, accrediting agencies, and the Department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters interpreted this section as applying State oversight to all institutions in a State. As a result,
these commenters believed that the Secretary expanded the SPRP beyond that authorized in the statute. The commenters
believed that the NPRM's stated purpose of the program, ``to strengthen State oversight of institutions participating
in the title IV, HEA programs through development of State standards for those institutions,'' was inaccurate and
``unduly alarming'' because it suggested that a SPRE was authorized to establish review standards for all institutions
in a State. Many of these commenters believed the primary purpose of the program was to reduce fraud and abuse in the
title IV, HEA programs through State oversight of selected institutions. Many other commenters believed that Congress
intended the program to focus exclusively on ``problem institutions'' identified by the Secretary, i.e., those
institutions that have serious academic or financial problems or those institutions that have otherwise failed
to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities in administering the title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary notes that &sect;667.1, as proposed, was not intended to apply to all institutions in a State but only
to institutions in a State that were participating in the title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary agrees that a SPRE only
has authority to review ``referred institutions'' under the standards it develops under this program, and therefore
agrees that the provisions of &sect;667.1(a) could be viewed as overbroad. The Secretary also agrees that a primary
purpose of the SPRP is to reduce fraud and abuse in the title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 667.1(a)(1) has been revised to clarify the purpose of the SPRP, and to clarify that under the SPRP a State's
standards apply only to referred institutions and that a State may review only referred institutions under those
standards.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged the Secretary to indicate that a SPRE could take an action against an entire institution or one
of the institution's branch campuses, additional locations, or educational programs. The commenter believed there
would be instances where a SPRE could determine that a branch campus or an additional location of the institution,
but not the entire institution, should be terminated from the title IV, HEA programs. The commenter also noted that
several of the State's standards apply only to specific educational programs and argued that it could be inappropriate
for a SPRE to take an adverse action against the entire institution if the basis for that action was a finding directly
related to a specific educational program offered by that institution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees that a SPRE has flexibility under the SPRP to craft a remedy along the lines suggested by the commenter.
Thus, the SPRE can require an institution to stop offering a particular program or stop offering programs at particular
locations or branch campuses. However, the Secretary believes that the authority of a SPRE under section 494C(h)
of the HEA to determine that an institution should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs relates to terminating
the institution as a whole, not to particular parts of the institution.

One commenter recommended that instead of using the statutory definition of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
education and general expenditures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
used for purposes of Title III of the HEA, which governs the Strengthening Institutions Program, the Secretary adopt
the definition used by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In addition, the commenter noted
that two financial-standard-making bodies have issued or have under consideration changes that will modify the
current accounting and reporting standards. The commenter suggested that the final regulations refer only to current
generally accepted accounting principles and financial reporting requirements by source rather than provide a
specific definition of education and general expenditures.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters agreed with the proposed definition of professional program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters argued that professional education is placed in the same category as occupational and vocational
education with regard to the standards described in sections 494C (d)(8) and (d)(14)(C) of the HEA. The commenters
contended that the use of professional education in this context implies a limited use of the term; namely, one that
is closely related to vocational education. These commenters suggested that the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be modified to include only programs at or below the associate degree level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested adopting the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) definition
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
first professional degree
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to ensure compatibility with data collected at the Federal level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter writing on behalf of a SPRE noted that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional programs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are defined and governed under the State's education and judiciary Laws. The commenter urged that the definition
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
recognize a State's statutory definition as provided under section 494C(d) of the HEA. (That section of the HEA requires
a State to develop standards that are consistent with the constitution and laws of the State.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Secretary disagrees with those commenters that suggest that the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be limited to programs at or below the associate degree level. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is commonly accepted as encompassing programs at higher degree levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be modified to recognize State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the IPEDS definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
first professional degree
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is too narrow. Under that definition, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
profession program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would encompass only 10 fields of study. However, the Secretary also agrees that the proposed definition was overly
broad in that it permitted overlap between what constitutes professional education and what constitutes vocational
education. The final regulations need to make the distinctions between both types of education clear. See also the
discussion of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has revised the second element of the proposed definition to maintain a clear distinction between the
terms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is an educational program that prepares individuals for an occupation, if that occupation requires, in part, at least
a bachelor's degree to qualify for entry. Also, the definition is expanded to allow a SPRE to use a State's statutory
definition of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All commenters agreed that the definition of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
under the SPRP be the same as the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational education 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accreditation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
regulations, 34 CFR part 602. Several commenters agreed with the proposed definition of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of these commenters preferred the SPRP definition to that proposed in the accreditation NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters writing on behalf of community colleges and universities believed the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was too broad. Many of these commenters believed strongly that proprietary institutions were primarily responsible
for abuses in the title IV, HEA programs, and it was unfair to classify associate degree programs as vocational programs
or to include any degree programs offered by community colleges or universities within the scope and meaning of the
term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters writing on behalf of proprietary and vocational institutions believed strongly that the proposed
definition was too narrow. These commenters noted that most postsecondary educational programs are employment
or career oriented and that students who enroll in those programs should be treated equally, regardless of the institution
they chose to attend. These commenters believe that the term vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should include all undergraduate programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter agreed with the propositions that the commenter claimed were presented in the accreditation NPRM that
(1) every postsecondary educational program is technically vocational, and (2) while all programs may be vocational
in nature, not all programs are academic. This commenter suggested that a better case be made for classifying programs
as ``academic'' or ``nonacademic.'' Under this approach, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be replaced by the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
nonacademic program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be defined to include any program described under proposed 34 CFR 668.8(c) (1) and (2), that (1) a program of at
least two academic years in length that provides an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, a professional degree,
or an equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, or (2) a program in which each course is acceptable for full
credit toward that institution's associate degree, bachelor's degree, professional degree, or equivalent degree
as determined by the Secretary, provided that the institution's degree requires at least two academic years of study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters believed that the proposed definition was too vague. Several of these commenters suggested adopting

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary further agrees with those commenters that suggested that the IPEDS/CIP definition, with minor modifications,
is the most appropriate definition to use in this part and in the accreditation regulations because under that definition,
educational programs are classified in a manner that is congruent with various SPRP statutory provisions that require
a clear identification and reporting of educational programs offered by an institution that are occupationally
specific and employment related.

 The Secretary agrees to be more specific in these regulations with regard to when sanctions will fall on a State that

 Section 667.3(d)(4) has been revised to provide that a State will have until December 31, 1995 to submit State review
standards that are subsequently approved by the Secretary if the State received fiscal year 1993 funds to carry out
SPRP activities, and until December 31, 1996 to submit those standards if the State that did not receive fiscal year
1993 funds to carry out SPRP activities. The deadline date for imposing sanctions has been changed from the date on

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters writing on behalf of SPREs argued that the Secretary should not impose sanctions on a State that
failed to establish review standards within two years if the reason for exceeding the proposed two-year limit was
due to (1) a State requirement to codify those standards in State regulations, or (2) a condition beyond the control
of the SPRE.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary disagrees that codifying standards in State regulations is a valid reason for not imposing sanctions
on a State that fails to establish review standards. Under &sect;667.12(a)(2), a State establishes review standards
if those standards meet the requirements in &sect;667.21 and the Secretary does not approve those standards under
&sect;667.22. This process of establishing standards is distinct from the process a SPRE may need to follow to codify
standards in State regulations. Accordingly, a SPRE may submit the State's standards to the Secretary for evaluation
while simultaneously beginning the process to codify those standards in State regulations as long as the State coordinates
the two processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, as noted above, the Secretary has extended the deadline date for submitting approved standards to the Secretary.
Therefore, the Secretary believes that no State codification process should prevent a State from submitting its
standards in a timely manner. Similarly the Secretary believes that a State should be able to meet that deadline regardless
of conditions outside its control.

 Several commenters were concerned that the provision in proposed &sect;667.3(b)(3)(iii) that stated that ``the

 Many commenters acknowledged that the statute requires a SPRE to review referred institutions on a schedule that
coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying institutions. Several commenters urged the Secretary
to require a SPRE to review only those institutions that represent the highest risk for fraud and abuse. A number of
other commenters suggested that the SPRE develop additional priorities for the review of this set of institutions
that would be compatible with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying these institutions.

 The Secretary acknowledges that a SPRE's allotment of funds may be inadequate to review all referred institutions
on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying institutions. For that reason, the Secretary
proposed in &sect;667.12(c) and restates in that same section in these regulations, to allow a State to establish
review priorities, giving States discretion to establish their own priorities, subject to the requirement for coordinating
with the Secretary's schedule for recertification of institutions. The Secretary expects that, to the extent possible,
States will select ``high-risk'' institutions for review.

that each institution in the State remains in compliance with the State's review standards developed pursuant to
section 494C of the HEA. The Secretary simply repeated these statutory provisions in proposed &sect;667.4. In the
NPRM preamble, the Secretary indicated that these statutory provisions did not give a SPRE itself authority under
this part to provide licenses to or legally authorize institutions to operate in a State, or ensure that all institutions
in the State remain in compliance with the State's standards. The Secretary agrees to accommodate the commenters

 Many commenters objected strongly to the proposed procedures regarding the confirmation of the data used by the Secretary
to refer an institution to a SPRE for review. These commenters urged the Secretary to discard those procedures and
establish new procedures under which a referred institution would be provided an opportunity to challenge the referral
data before the Secretary referred that institution to a SPRE. Under the suggested procedures, the Secretary would
not refer an institution to a SPRE if that institution challenged the referral data within the time permitted by the
Secretary. The Secretary would only refer an institution to a SPRE if the institution did not challenge the referral
data or the Secretary confirmed the challenged referral data.

 Based on public comment and further review, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution should be
given an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of referral data before the Secretary refers that institution to a
SPRE for review. Similarly, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution should be given an opportunity
to challenge the accuracy of referral data before a State notifies the Secretary that it wishes to review an institution
on the basis of having more current information that the institution satisfies one or more of the referral criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an institution challenges the information on which the Secretary or the State based its referral, the Secretary
and the State presume that records maintained in the normal course of business by ED, a guaranty agency under the FFEL
programs, a SPRE, a State licensing agency, or another State agency are accurate unless the institution proves to
the Secretary's satisfaction that the records are not properly maintained or are inaccurate. Thus, unless an institution
can prove that the information on which its referral is based is inaccurate, the institution will be referred for SPRE
review.

 A number of commenters agreed that it would be wasteful continually to refer an institution to a SPRE for review for
an event that happened once. In the NPRM, the Secretary proposed to reserve for future consideration whether to refer
an institution to a SPRE for review under three criteria if on the basis of an earlier referral, the SPRE conducted a
review of the institution and made no significant findings. These criteria were those relating to late audits, changes
of ownership, and the first five years of participating in a title IV, HEA program. These commenters also suggested
that this consideration ought to be given to more or all of the referral criteria.

 The Secretary attempted to resolve this problem by proposing remedies through legislation. However, in the Higher
Education Technical Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;208, only one of the three subject criteria, the criterion
set forth in &sect;667.5(b)(10) was addressed. With regard to that criterion, an institution participating for
less than five years in a title IV, HEA program must be referred to a SPRE, but the Secretary may determine that the SPRE
need not review the institution if the institution was referred solely under &sect;667.5(b)(10), and the SPRE previously
conducted a review of that institution and found no violations of the State's standards. For the other two criteria,
the Secretary believes that section 494C(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to refer institutions that meet those
other two requirements. However, to avoid wasting a SPRE's time and effort, the Secretary will allow a SPRE to place
institutions on the lowest review priority if the institutions were referred because of a late audit or a change in
ownership and a previous SPRE review found no significant violations of State standards.

 If the Secretary withdraws a limitation, suspension, or termination action solely because the Secretary determines
that there was no factual basis for that action, the Secretary will not consider that action as triggering a referral.
However, if the Secretary withdraws a limitation, suspension, or termination action against an institution because
of an action on the part of the institution, or the promise of some current or future action on the part of the institution,
the initiation of the Secretary's action will trigger a referral.

should be waived in cases where the State has reason to believe that institutions were engaged in fraudulent practices.

 A number of commenters believed that the Secretary should shorten the time period proposed in the NPRM for notifying
SPREs of Federal actions. Several of these commenters suggested shortening the time period to 5 days, while others
suggested notification within 48 hours in cases where the Secretary intended to terminate an institution's participation
in a title IV, HEA program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested that the Secretary notify the SPRE in writing of the applicable action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Secretary make clear that an action includes a limitation, suspension, or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters urged the Secretary to (1) provide to accrediting agencies the same information provided to

 The Secretary proposed 10 days in the NPRM because in some instances the Secretary may need to confirm information
before providing it to a SPRE. The Secretary agrees that accrediting agencies should also be notified by the Secretary
and by SPREs. Accordingly, the Secretary (1) intends to notify SPREs and accrediting agencies of Federal actions
as soon as possible and provide this notification orally in writing, and (2) will require States to notify accrediting
agencies of SPRE actions. The Secretary further agrees to include as Federal actions those identified by the commenters.

accrediting agencies of SPRE reviews of referred institutions and SPRE findings and planned and actual corrective
actions. This section is also revised to provide that the Secretary notifies the appropriate nationally recognized
accrediting agency of actions taken by the Secretary or another Federal agency against an institution.

 Many commenters objected to the proposed requirement that an institution's branch campuses or additional locations

commenters believed strongly that an institution's branch campuses and additional locations be subject only to
the standards of the State in which the main campus of that institution is located. The commenters argued that it is
unreasonable and burdensome to require an institution's branch campuses and locations to comply with different
State standards.

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. This provision is consistent with the requirements that an institution
must satisfy to obtain institutional eligibility under the HEA for locations or branch campuses in States different
from the main campus. For institutional eligibility purposes, the institution must obtain a license or other legal
authority to provide postsecondary education at the branch campus or additional location from the State in which
the branch campus or other location is physically located, not the Senate in which the main location is physically
located.

 Two commenters writing on behalf of States that would receive the minimum allotment under the proposed formula believed
strongly that a SPRE could not conduct reviews of referred institutions and carry out its other responsibilities
under this part within that allotment. One of these commenters suggested the minimum allotment be increased from
$50,000 to $75,000. The other commenter contended that a SPRE's actual costs in carrying out its responsibilities
would be five to ten times the proposed minimum amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters writing on behalf of States were concerned that unanticipated and extraordinary expenses a SPRE
could incur as a result of a legal challenge from a referred institution to the SPRE's determination that the institution
should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs, could prevent the SPRE from carrying out its planned activities
under this part. These commenters suggested that the final regulations provide for an appeal to the Secretary by the
SPRE for additional funds to meet those legal costs and unanticipated and extraordinary expenses.

 A commenter writing on behalf of a number of associations suggested that each State should be required to submit a plan,
not only to develop the review standards and complaint procedures, but also to identify information maintained by
institutions and State agencies that is relevant to the development the State review standards. Additionally, the
commenter suggested that the plan should also include the costs of coordinating information systems and should identify
information not currently collected that is needed to demonstrate compliance with review standards. The commenter
recommended that the proposed regulations be revised to require a State to provide the estimated total cost to develop
the SPRE's information system if the total cost exceeds the State's fiscal year 1993 allotment. The commenter also
suggested that a State be required to provide the total estimated cost to review all referred institutions even if
the total estimated cost of reviews exceeds the State's allotment. The commenter believes these costs are among those
that President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 requires the Secretary to identify and consider in determining,
when developing regulations, the costs and benefits of collecting and maintaining regulatory information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers these regulations to satisfy section 1(b)(6) of Executive Order 12866 that requires each
agency to assess both the costs and benefits of the intended regulations. The Secretary further believes that it is
unnecessary to require a State to provide the estimated costs to carry out any functions of the SPRP that exceed the
State's allotment since the SPRE is not required to perform functions in excess of that allotment.

 One commenter was concerned that a student or other party may try to hold a SPRE liable for alleged harm based on his or
her reliance on an institution's continued eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds in a case where the institution
is referred to a SPRE because the SPRE did not have sufficient funds to conduct that review. The commenter suggested
that a provision preventing any liability from falling on the SPRE for failing to review an institution because of
inadequate funding be added to the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters agreed with the Secretary that the SPRE's review priorities should reflect the objectives of protecting
students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality, but differed on the methods to best accomplish
those objectives. Many of these commenters agreed strongly with the proposal in the NPRM that a SPRE be provided maximum
flexibility in selecting institutions to review, except as provided by the statute; i.e., under section 494A(b)
of the HEA, a SPRE must review referred institutions on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for
recertifying those institutions. Several of these commenters suggested that the SPRE be required to publicize its
review priority system to assure consistent selection of referred institutions under that system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters believed strongly that a SPRE should first review referred institutions that meet multiple referral
criteria. Many other commenters believed strongly that a SPRE should consider, in addition to the referral criteria,
other factors, such as data measuring student outcomes (for instance, graduation and placement rates), and other
information a State might have that would indicate that a referred institution was not properly providing its educational
programs. Several commenters suggested that the Secretary set the review priorities to ensure that all SPREs select
institutions on the same basis. A number of commenters contended that an overwhelming number of institutions scheduled
by the Secretary for recertification would also meet a referral criterion. Those commenters feared that this pool
of institutions would be so great that a SPRE would never be able to select institutions under the State's review priority
system. To alleviate this problem, the commenters recommended that the NPRM be revised to allow a SPRE to select institutions
for review under the State's priority system from among the pool of referred institutions the Secretary scheduled
for recertification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a State's allotment is less than will be needed to review all referred institutions, the Secretary believes that
a SPRE is in a better position than the Secretary to determine which institutions to select for review from among all
the referred institutions. The Secretary also believes that any of the review priorities suggested by the commenters
could be effective in selecting ``problem institutions'' for review under this program, provided that those priorities
reflect the objectives of protecting students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality. Therefore,
the Secretary will not require a SPRE to adopt any of the commenters priority suggestions for establishing priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter who noted that for some States for some years, the number of institutions scheduled
for recertification by the Secretary may exceed the money allotted to the State for reviews. Under that circumstance,
the SPRE will use its priority criteria to select for review only institutions scheduled for recertification by the
Secretary.

is added to permit a SPRE to place an institution in the lowest priority for review if the institution was referred because
of a late audit or a change in ownership and a previous SPRE review found no significant violations of State standards.

 The Secretary disagrees. The Secretary believes that more frequent audits are not necessary to monitor adequately
the activities of a SPRE. The Secretary believes that requiring a SPRE to have an annual audit would divert funds away

the cost of an audit would represent a significant portion of the allotment.

Section 667.21&blank;State Review Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received many comments regarding the framework, proposed in &sect;667.21(b), under which a State
develops review standards. In proposing the framework, the Secretary intended to achieve the following objectives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To recognize and account for the diversity of institutions that would be subject to the standards by allowing States
to establish different standards for those institutions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To facilitate effective enforcement of State standards by requiring States to quantify certain standards, and
by requiring States to specify the records and information an institution would need to maintain for those standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To limit the scope of the quantitative standards by allowing a State to apply those standards only to regular students,
i.e., students enrolled at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized
credential offered by the institution; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To introduce a level of rigor in the standards by requiring a State to determine whether a comparable title IV, HEA
program standard would be an acceptable State standard.

Quantified Standards

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters writing on behalf of institutions and several accrediting bodies objected to the requirement proposed
in the NPRM that a State quantify certain review standards by establishing ``acceptable percentages'' for those
standards. Many of these commenters believed strongly that this requirement constitutes an ``enforcement mechanism''
and thus violates section 494C(k) of the HEA. A number of commenters acknowledged that the statute allows a State to
establish quantitative standards but did not believe that the Secretary has the authority under the statute to require
a State to develop quantitative standards. A number of commenters believed that quantitative standards were too
restrictive and feared that States would develop such standards without regard to the mission of institutions. Several
commenters believed that enforcement of quantified standards would impinge on institutional autonomy and force
institutions to shift their missions away from serving high-risk students. A number of commenters believed that
standards reduced to ``acceptable percentages'' would either by arbitrary, and probably without legal defense,
or statistical, and would, be definition, place a number of institutions below the acceptable levels, regardless
of whether the performance of those institutions is otherwise outstanding. Still other commenters argued that standards
based on minimum ``acceptable percentages'' would create a safe harbor for institutions that might otherwise be
judged to be substandard. By achieving the numerical minimum, such institutions would be able to tie the SPREs' hands
and escape adverse action that might otherwise be warranted because, under the NPRM, the SPRE must consider those
institutions to be in compliance with the review standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters writing on behalf of States and student legal services organizations agreed with the proposal. These
commenters believed strongly that objective, quantified standards are essential for meaningful enforcement and
regulatory review.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary disagrees strongly with the commenters who contend that the proposed requirement that a State quantify
certain review standards by establishing acceptable percentages for those standards, constitutes an ``enforcement
mechanism'' in violation of section 494C(k) of the HEA. That section of the HEA states, ``Nothing in this subpart shall
restrict the authority of the States to establish mechanisms to enforce the standards established under subsection
(d) or require the States to establish specific mechanisms recommended by the Secretary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The restriction on the enforcement of standards in section 494C(k) is based upon the establishment of standards under
section 494C(d). Therefore, the restriction on the enforcement of standards has no bearing on the establishment
of those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who indicated that the Secretary is without authority to require States
to develop quantitative standards. The nature of the standards imposed by statute is such that without quantifiable
measures, the standards would be meaningless.

While the Secretary understands the concerns of some of the commenters that States might develop standards without
regard to institutional mission or that enforcement of quantified standards could either force institutions away
from serving high-risk students, or allow some institutions that would otherwise be judged to be substandard under
other measures to escape State oversight, the Secretary believes that quantitative student outcome standards are
an extremely valuable measure of the success of an institution. Quite the contrary to the views of the commenters,
the Secretary believes that the imposition of quantifiable standards will have the effect of improving institutional
quality and will protect high-risk students from unscrupulous substandard institutions. Further, quantifiable
standards will assist prospective students and their parents in making choices about attendance at institutions.
The Secretary further notes there is nothing in this part that would preclude a State from taking into account the fact
that an institution serves high-risk students.

Many commenters writing on behalf of proprietary institutions objected strongly to the proposal to allow a State
to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions. These commenters argued that
Congress intended that all institutions be judged under the same standards, except as explicitly provided in the
statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many other commenters agreed strongly with the proposal. A number of these commenters urged the Secretary to require,
not simply allow, States to develop different standards for different types of institutions to ensure that all SPREs
take into consideration the nature and mission of institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments urged the Secretary to allow States to develop different standards only for different categories
of institutions to protect institutions from being placed in arbitrary categories by States and to promote nationwide
consistency in identifying categories. The commenters recommended that institutions be categorized according
to (1) their for- or not-for-profit status, (2) whether they grant degrees, and (3) the levels and types of degrees
or educational programs they offer.

The Secretary believes that State standards should reflect the mission of institutions and that enforcement of such
standards will allow SPREs to accomplish most effectively the purpose of the SPRP. The fact that the SPRP is a program
designed to strengthen the State role in the program integrity triad means that the program is intended to foster the
flexibility that inevitably results from differences among the States. The Secretary reiterates that States are
provided flexibility in developing standards. Thus, a State may categorize institutions or educational programs
in a manner that the State deems appropriate.

 Commenters generally agreed that a State's standards should be applied only to regular students at institutions.
A few commenters opined that quantified standards would be misleading and irrelevant to institutions that offer
open admissions because many students who attend those institutions do not aspire to attain a certificate or a degree,
yet have a specific educational goal.

The Secretary believes that in evaluating student outcomes of an institution, and most particularly with regard
to institutions offering open enrollment, the evaluation should be based on regular students because they are the
ones who can qualify for title IV, HEA funds, the protection of which is one of the primary purposes of SPRP.

Comparable Title IV, HEA Program Standard as an Acceptable State Standard

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters objected to the proposal to require a SPRE to consider the relevance of a title IV, HEA program standard
as a requirement in establishing the State's standards. The commenters believed that acceptance of Federal standards,
and application of those standards, by a SPRE would have an adverse effect on institutions at which a small percentage
of students receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters believed the proposal is a reasonable approach because institutions that participate
in the title IV, HEA programs already have to comply with these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters believed that this provisions should be expanded to require a SPRE to adopt comparable State
licensure standards if those standards are more rigorous than comparable title IV, HEA program standards. The commenters
argued that if a SPRE adopts review standards that are less rigorous than the State licensing standards, institutions
might later argue persuasively to the State legislature to reduce the State licensing standards to the level of lower
SPRE standards on the grounds that varying standards would be onerous and confusing. At the very least, these commenters
suggested that the Secretary require States to establish standards that are at least as rigorous as the comparable
title IV, HEA program standards.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is giving SPREs latitude to develop standards and expects States to take into account comparable title
IV, HEA program standards as they develop their own standards. The Secretary does not agree that this program will
have an adverse impact on institutions at which only a few students receive title IV, HEA program assistance (1) because
the SPRP only requires a SPRE to establish standards for referred institutions, and (2) because any standard that
a SPRE establishes that is comparable to a title IV, HEA program requirement already applies to those institutions
as title IV, HEA program participants. The Secretary agrees, however, with the commenters who noted that it does not
make sense for a State to adopt standards under the SPRP that are weaker than its State licensing standards. Nevertheless,
this is a matter that must be resolved among the appropriate State authorities.

Many commenters strongly urged the Secretary to make clear in the final regulations that a SPRE may not require an institution
that has not been referred by the Secretary to the SPRE for review to maintain these records and information. A number
of these commenters suggested if that institution is later referred by the Secretary to the SPRE for review, the SPRE
should be required to assist the institution in generating the required information, or that the SPRE should be required
to allow the institution a reasonable time to comply with the State's standards and recordkeeping requirements.

it did not keep those records, the Secretary agrees that the State should allow an institution a reasonable period
of time to obtain records and information to enable the institution to demonstrate its compliance with the State's
standards.

Relationship Between Tuition-and-Fee Charges and Remuneration

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters objected to the proposal that a State establish an acceptable percentage for the relationship between
the tuition and fees charged by an institution for an educational program and the amount of money that a student who
successfully completes that program actually earns. A number of commenters believed strongly that this approach
would be administratively unmanageable for comprehensive institutions that offer a broad spectrum of programs,
including programs in liberal arts, sciences, teacher education, engineering, and nursing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters believed that the Secretary does not have the authority under the statute to require a SPRE to make
a judgment regarding the reasonableness of the tuition and fees charged by an institution. Many of these commenters
contended that the standard, as proposed in the NPRM, was tantamount to price-fixing. The commenters argued that
this standard, as articulated in the statute, simply requires an institution to disclose to students and prospective
students information on program costs and on earnings that a graduate of that program could reasonably be expected
to make in an occupation related to that program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters asserted that relating the amount of tuition and fees to the amount of money a graduate of an educational
program earns assumes incorrectly that (1) the institution alone is responsible for a student's education and employment,
and (2) salary is the only reason for education. The commenters pointed out that a student is also responsible for his
or her education and that the student may choose a job that is rewarding in ways other than money.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters pointed out that States sometimes establish the tuition and fees for certain programs at public institutions.
The commenters urged the Secretary to exempt these programs from this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters contended that States do not have adequate data on wages and salaries either to establish an acceptable
percentage or determine that an institution met that percentage. These commenters were concerned that the results
of surveys conducted by an institution of its graduates' earnings would not be reliable. Finally, many commenters
argued that any formula governing the relationship between tuition and remuneration consider State subsidies provided
to public institutions to ensure a fair comparison of tuition and fees between like programs offered by all types of
institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters agreed with the proposal.

 The Secretary notes that this requirement only applies to vocational programs and therefore does not apply to programs
such as liberal arts programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that commenters are correct when they note that many variables influence whether a person
obtains a particular job. However, the Secretary believes that one of the most important factors is the job training
of that individual. Further, institutions that purport to offer education to prepare students for occupations ought
to be able to substantiate that the education they provide does just that. In addition, for students who receive loans
for their education, it is reasonable to expect that they will qualify for positions that will enable them to repay
those loans. For these reasons, the Secretary disagrees with the commenters who categorized this standard merely
as a student consumer information disclosure requirement or that it is tantamount to price fixing. More appropriately,
under this standard, a SPRE must determine whether an institution's tuition and fees are too high, given the remuneration
that its graduates can reasonably expect to receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, based on public comment and further review, the Secretary has decided that an institution should not be required
to survey its graduates to obtain employment and wage data; rather, a SPRE may rely on local, State, or Federal employment
and wage data to determine the institution's compliance with this standard.

charged by an institution for a vocational program are excessive compared to the amount of money that a student who
successfully completes that program may reasonably be expected to earn. Section 667.21(a)(9)(i) is changed to clarify
that this is the purpose of the standard. In addition, &sect;667.22(b)(5) is revised to require a State to specify

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters objected to the proposal that a SPRE judge the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess
that a student has the ability to complete successfully the educational program for which he or she applied. Many commenters
argued that there is no correlation between an institution's assessment method and the graduation rate of students
in an educational program. The commenters cited many reasons that a student might fail to complete a program that is
unrelated to the student's academic ability, including motivation, personal finances, family obligations, a change
in employement, and others, and suggested that the proposed requirement be removed. Many other commenters contended
that the Secretary exceeded statutory authority in proposing this requirement. A number of these commenters argued
that requiring a SPRE to judge the effectiveness of an institution's assessment method could lead to the use of mandatory,
standardized tests, or other methods that require profiles of program completers, for determining a student's admission
into a program. These commenters believed the use of these methods would lead institutions whose mission is to serve
high-risk students to change their mission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters suggested that the proposed standard be expanded to (1) include other positive outcome
measures, or (2) allow a SPRE to consider the rigor, fairness, and consistent application of an institution's assessment
method in judging that method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters agreed with the proposal but suggested that an SPRE's judgment regarding the effectiveness
of an institution's assessment method should be limited to vocational programs. Like many other commenters, these
commenters contended that there is little direct correlation between student success and admissions standards
for degree programs. One of these commenters argued that there is a much stronger correlation between student success
and admissions criteria in vocational programs than in degree programs because of the shorter length and more narrow
focus of vocational programs. The commenter believed there is a greater need to assess the adequacy of the admission
standards for vocational programs because the population served by those programs tends to be less prepared for postsecondary
education than students in degree programs. Another commenter believed strongly that an extraordinarily high student
drop-out rate (1) may indicate other serious problems with an educational program, including the poor quality of
its teachers or the lack of necessary equipment, and (2) invariably indicates enrollment of students unable to understand
or handle course material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few other commenters believed that the ``ability-to-benefit'' provision in the title IV, HEA program regulations
satisfies the statutory requirement under this part that an institution have a method to assess a student's ability
to complete successfully an educational program.

 A number of commenters, including several commenters writing on behalf of States, urged the Secretary to define the
term ``financially at risk'' as that term applies to the standard under which a SPRE would require an institution to
provide for the instruction of students and the retention of records in the event the institution closes.

One commenter opined that it was critical that quantitative measures be consistent within and among all States and
believed that the Student-Right-to-Know regulations, when published, will provide a uniform basis for calculating
student graduation rates. The commenter recommended a coordinated study by the research community to develop acceptable
percentages for the quantified standards and suggested that the implementation of those standards should be delayed
for 12 to 18 months pending the results of that study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Several commenters urged the Secretary to remove the proposed references to the

The Secretary agrees that the Student-Right-to-Know methodology will provide a uniform basis for calculating student
graduation rates, and encourages States to develop consistent methods for calculating student withdrawal rates,
placement rates, and licensure examination pass rates to reduce burden on institutions. The Secretary acknowledges,
however, that some States have developed robust student information systems, and does not intend to force those States
to use specific methodologies for computing rates to measure student outcomes. Therefore, the Secretary disagrees
with the commenters who suggest (1) that it is critical that all States adopt the same quantitative measures, or (2)
a delay in implementing those measures is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

relationship between an educational program and a job.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters suggested that the Secretary should expand this standard. The commenters were concerned that the
standard does not specify the geographical scope of the labor market information to be provided, nor does it specify
that average entry-level earnings should be provided. In addition, the commenters believed that the proposed provision
regarding the disclosure of State licensing requirements should be more specific. According to the commenters,
some of the most egregious title IV, HEA program abuses have involved institutions that, by enrolling a student in
a program that required a State license, implied that the program met, and the student would meet, the State's licensing
requirements when in fact the institution failed to provide adequate training to meet those requirements. The commenters
suggested that the standard be revised to require an institution to describe in clear and specific terms how its educational
program meets, and a student in the program would be able to meet, the relevant State licensing requirements.

The Secretary believes that a SPRE's standards in this area will only be acceptable if they are applied in a meaningful
manner that meets the demands of these last commenters, but the criterion in these regulations does not have need to
be revised to accomplish this purpose. With regard to the comments concerning the geographical scope of labor market
information on the determination of entry-level earnings based on averages, the Secretary does not disagree that
these might be relevant and valid considerations. The Secretary does not believe, however, that these regulations
need to specify all the factors that contribute to making disclosures meaningful. Instead, these factors are best
considered when a SPRE consults with the institutions in its State to develop the standard for applying this provision.

A number of commenters opined that the NPRM would empower the Secretary to exercise control over an institution in
a manner that is contrary to section 103(b) of the Department of Education's Organization Act (Pub. L. 98&hyph;88).
The commenters believed that the Secretary would exercise control over the direction, supervision, or curriculum,
program of instruction, administration, or personnel or an institution through the evaluation of State review standards.
According to the commenters, given the influence of States over institutions by virtue of State review standards,
evaluation of those standards by the Secretary enables the Secretary to exercise the direction, supervision, and
control over institutions that is prohibited by law.

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. First, section 494C(d) of the HEA provides that the standards shall
be subject to the Secretary's disapproval. Second, under the same statutory provision, these standards must be developed
by the SPRE in consultation with institutions in the SPRE's State, and these regulations provide in &sect;667.22(a)
for the Secretary to take that consultation into consideration in determining whether the standards may be disapproved.
The Secretary believes that institutional participation in the development of standards does not constitute interference
in institutional areas protected by the Department of Education Organization Act.

(3) Information that is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the review standards, including information not

(4) A provision that would allow an institution to provide directly to the Secretary comments of third parties regarding
the State's review standards within a specified time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that the Secretary clarify the proposed criterion regarding the use of statistically
valid methods and procedures to obtain employment-related data through the conduct of surveys of an institution
graduates. A few commenters suggested that the Secretary substitute for that requirement a provision to use ``representative
sampling.'' The commenters contended that representative sampling would be a less onerous requirement, especially
for smaller institutions.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary thanks the commenters for their suggestions for additional criteria for reviewing standards. The
Secretary has decided not to accept the first one because it imposes an unnecessary burden on a State to include a rationale
for a standard where the rationale would be self-evident from the standard. However, the Secretary will use the commenters'
suggestion as a useful guideline for determining whether to disapprove a particular standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has decided not to adopt the second suggestion because a State could not adopt a standard that was in violation
of its State law. The Secretary has decided not to adopt the third suggestion because that information is not necessary
to determining whether a standard is not acceptable. It is left to a SPRE to establish how an institution complies specifically
with a standard. Finally, the Secretary did not adopt the fourth suggestion because it is the responsibility of a State
in consulting with institutions in the development of those standards, to obtain and consider all relevant comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter writing on behalf of an accrediting commission, urged the Secretary to make a State's review standards
subject to third party review. The commenter also recommended this treatment for a SPRE's plan and budget for carrying
out the activities under this part. The commenter believed that the statute and the proposed regulations require
the Secretary to exercise informed judgment on whether a number of broad standards have been met. Third-party comment
would provide valuable input to the Secretary's exercise of informed judgment. In addition, the commenter offered
the view that if the Secretary's key goal for the Program Integrity Triad is to reduce redundancy and promote complimentary
input from interested parties, notably other members of the triad and affected institutions, would help the Secretary
determine whether State plans, budgets, and standards are in fact complementary to the efforts of the Department
and nationally recognized accrediting agencies and not unduly burdensome to institutions. Finally, in the commenters
opinion, input from third parties would also help prevent the Secretary from mistake or embarrassment. For example,
if the consultative process in a State has been inadequate, it is highly unlikely that the State will reveal the inadequacies
in its submission to the Secretary. Institutions that have been adversely affected, however, could point out those
deficiencies before Federal funds are wasted on SPRE efforts to apply standards that may later legitimately be challenged.
Similarly, nationally recognized accrediting agencies may provide useful information to the Secretary about proposed
contracts with other ``peer review systems'' that are inadequate to the tasks that they would be given. The commenter
maintained that according to interested parties the right to review and comment need not be burdensome or time-consuming,
and recommended procedures under which the Secretary would provide for and receive third-party comment on a State's
review standards, and the SPRE's plans and budgets, before determining whether to approve those standards and plans.

 each State's application for funds and each State's review standards, and allow a 30 day comment period and consider
that comment, before determining whether to approve a State's application or disapprove a State's standards. These
procedures would delay unnecessarily decisions the Secretary must make to ensure proper and timely administration
of the SPRE. Moreover, the Secretary believes that inadequate consultation with all affected parties will likely
be revealed in deficient standards, which the Secretary will have the authority to review and disapprove.

information. Other commenters suggested that an institution be required to generate data regarding these rates
only when the institution is reviewed by a SPRE.

argued that this would provide for efficient use of SPRE resources and reduce the burden on referred institutions.

Section 494C(d) of the HEA requires a SPRE, in conducting its review of a referred institution, to determine the institution's

each of the State's standards.

to an institution. Some commenters suggested increasing the time from 45 days to 60 days; other commenters suggested
decreasing the time to 30 days. Another commenter asked the Secretary to clarify what constitutes the completion
of a review and recommended that a SPRE issue its initial report no later than 45 days after it has completed its review
of the institutions under all of the State's standards and has received a report from the relevant accrediting agency
or peer review system.

The Secretary believes that 45 days provides a SPRE with sufficient time to prepare a report of findings. The Secretary
considers the 45-day period to begin at the time a SPRE has completed its review of all of the documentation and information
it needs in order to prepare the report, including information provided by an accrediting agency or peer review system.
The Secretary notes, however, that this does not preclude a SPRE from issuing a partial report of its findings to an
institution, if, for example, the SPRE determines that the institution must, or should, take immediate actions in
response to the SPRE's findings.

Several commenters took issue with the proposal that a SPRE may prescribe a course of action a referred institution
must follow to correct a violation of the State's standards. One of the commenters believed that a SPRE should be allowed
to recommend, but not prescribe, the course by which an institution brings itself into compliance with State standards.
The commenter argued that allowing a SPRE to prescribe a course of action would constitute an inappropriate interference
with normal institutional governance and management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters were concerned that the Secretary set the wrong tone in the NPRM by suggesting that a SPRE take actions
to effect the termination of an institution only when the SPRE finds that the institution ``continuously or egregiously
violated the State's standards.'' The commenters believed that SPREs will not be the overzealous terminators that
institutions and many others fear; more likely, SPREs will generally be disinclined to take forceful actions against
institutions in their State for fear of litigation and other repercussions that would result from those actions.
The commenters urged the Secretary to change the regulations to make clear that in all cases where a referred institution
fails to meet a State standard, the SPRE would be required to prescribe a course of action the institution would need
follow to correct the violation. The commenters further believed that a SPRE should be required to initiate a proceeding
under &sect;667.25 to effect the termination of an institution, if the institution did not bring itself into compliance
with the State standards within a time specified in regulations unless the SPRE extended that time for good cause.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees strongly with the first series of comments because a SPRE would not be able to enforce the State's
standards if it could not require an institution to take the corrective action it determined the institution needed
to take to bring the institution into compliance with its standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Secretary agrees strongly with the commenters that SPREs take consistent and appropriate actions against
institutions that fail to comply with the State's standards, the Secretary does not believe that it is necessary or
prudent to require a SPRE, on an absolute basis, to prescribe a course of action an institution must follow to correct
a violation and bring itself into compliance with State standards, particularly with the State's quantified standards.
An institution's compliance with acceptable percentages established for those standards is not inviolate; the
acceptable percentage reflects, or should reflect, whether the institution is successfully providing its educational
programs, rather than whether the institution should be terminated because it failed to satisfy that percentage.
In the NPRM, the Secretary acknowledged that developing such standards will be difficult, and in fairness to institutions,
proposed that a SPRE provide an institution the opportunity to present compelling evidence that would demonstrate
to the SPRE that its failure to meet a State standard would not warrant any further action by the SPRE. Thus, in &sect;667.23(c),
the Secretary permits the SPRE to determine whether to prescribe a course of action and the nature of that action.

that the minimum number be set at 30, 40, 45, 60, or 90 days, or be set by the Secretary in regulations. Most of the commenters
argued that the setting of a minimum number of days was needed because the regulations did not provide for an appeal
by an institution of the SPRE's findings to the Secretary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns that a SPRE could take a precipitous action against an institution
by not allowing the institution sufficient time to respond to its report. As stated previously, however, the Secretary
believes strongly that a SPRE is in the best position to determine the actions it should take in carrying out its review
responsibilities, and, in view of the change made to &sect;667.23(d), the Secretary has no reason to believe that
a SPRE would not afford an institution a reasonable time to respond to its report.

Several commenters were concerned that a SPRE might punish an institution by initiating a proceeding to effect the
termination of the institution's participation in a title IV, HEA program if the institution did not respond ``quickly
enough'' to the SPRE's request for information, access to the institution, or access to personnel at the institution.
The commenters agreed, in principle, that an institution should not be able to thwart the efforts of a SPRE to obtain
necessary information by refusing to provide to the SPRE information or access to the institution, but believed that
the NPRM provided the SPRE too much authority. The commenters recommended removing two parts of the provision and
modifying the third part so that a SPRE would take an action if ``*&blank;*&blank;* the institution exhibits a documented
pattern of failure to allow SPRE personnel at the institution or repeated failure to provide SPRE officials with access
to documents or records.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters believed that, although the proposed provisions were appropriate, some changes should be
made. A few commenters argued that a SPRE should view all violations of the State's standards as serious violations
and recommended that the term ``serious'' be removed from the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* the SPRE's findings show
serious violations of the State's standards.''

The Secretary does not agree that a SPRE must request repeatedly, and be denied repeatedly, information or access
by an institution before taking an action. The Secretary agrees to remove the term ``serious,'' but in doing so does
not intend that a SPRE take an action under these provisions for because of a technical violation by an institution.

A number of commenters responded to the request in the NPRM regarding specific areas where SPRE performance standards
should be established and how that performance should be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should consider a SPRE's performance to be seriously deficient
if the SPRE exhibits a pattern of (1) allowing reviewed institutions an excessive time to correct violations, or (2)
not initiating termination proceedings against institutions for serious violations of the State's standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters suggested that the Secretary evaluate a SPRE's performance based on the SPRE's success in completing
its objectives under the plan the SPRE submits annually to the Secretary, and on other areas related to the SPRE compliance
with statutory requirements.

The Secretary appreciates the commenters suggestions. Based on these suggestions, and upon further review, the
Secretary has decided not to promulgate specific SPRE performance criteria because the Secretary already has, or
will have, access to all of the information or records pertaining to the suggested criteria. In addition, the Secretary
intends that on occasion Department of Education officials and representatives will accompany SPRE personnel in
conducting reviews of referred institutions.

Section 667.24&blank;Peer Review of Institutions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, writing on behalf of an accrediting commission, objected strongly to the regulations and views expressed
in the NPRM. The commenter argued that if States wish to use peer review systems other than recognized accrediting
agencies, those peer review systems should be subject to an approval process established and administered by the
Secretary along the lines of the proposal noted in the NPRM preamble. The commenter submitted that ceding the choice
of peer review systems to the States would be an abdication of the Secretary's responsibilities and an invitation
to abuse. According to the commenter, the goals of Congress for ensuring integrity in the title IV, HEA programs will
not be met if, in the future, instances come to light where the quality reviews performed by ``peer review systems''
on behalf of SPREs have been found to be inadequate, politicized, or abused. In addition, the commenter believed that
it could not be assumed that every SPRE would appropriately choose or create peer review systems that will be competent
to assess institutions and programs. For these reasons, the commenter urged the Secretary to define in final regulations
a ``peer review system'' and the process by which such systems are to have shown ``demonstrated competence in assessing
programs.'' Many commenters echoed this commenter's views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Secretary permit a SPRE the use of a ``peer review system'' only in cases where
there is substantial reason to doubt the reliability of the accrediting agency's evaluation of an institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters agreed that a SPRE should determine the competence of a peer review system and agreed that the
criteria listed in the NPRM preamble are appropriate for making that determination. Some of these commenters suggested
the following additional criteria:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The system has clear and effective controls against conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The system is independent administratively and financially of the SPRE, and is able to make decisions and recommendations
free from undue influence by the SPRE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believed that a SPRE should have the flexibility to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether
to sue the services of an accrediting agency or a peer review system. The commenters offered, however that a SPRE should
have defensible procedures in place for selecting a peer review system, and suggested that final regulations require
a SPRE to publicize and submit to the Secretary the criteria and procedures it uses to select an appropriate accrediting
body or peer review system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that a SPRE should be required to develop its own mechanism to assure that a peer review
system meets the same level of quality as a recognized accrediting agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Still other commenters believed that a peer system should have the same qualifications and meet the same criteria
required of nationally recognized accrediting agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees with the comments of the first commenter because the Secretary believes SPREs will select
competent peer review systems. Moreover, the Secretary disagrees with the suggestion of the second set of commenters
because section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA does not contain that limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the suggestions of the other commenters and further review, the Secretary believes that a peer review system
(1) must have an established basis for evaluating educational quality, (2) must have review procedures that include
the selection of peer reviewers who have experience in evaluating the types of programs offered by the institution,
and (3) must have established policies and procedures that guard against bias in conducting reviews of institutions.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters were concerned that providing termination authority to a SPRE represented a potential conflict
with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and perhaps with the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the
Untied States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees. If the SPRE took an action against a referred institution because the institution violated
a SPRE standard and treated that institution in the same manner as it treated other institutions that had the same or
similar violations, the SPRE's action would not violate title VI of the Civil Rights Act nor the equal protection clause
of the Constitution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questioned whether a SPRE could provide notice to the Secretary to terminate an institution's participation
in a title IV, HEA program based solely on findings resulting from a review conducted by a nationally recognized accrediting
agency or other peer review system.

It depends. First, it depends on whether the institution was a referred institution. Second, it depends on the nature
of those accrediting agency or peer review findings. Moreover, before it could recommend termination, the SPRE would
have to give the institution a hearing at which the institution could challenge the findings of the accrediting agency
or peer review.

Many commenters believed strongly that the Secretary should allow an institution to appeal to the Secretary a SPRE's
determination that the institution should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs. A number of these commenters
recommended that the Secretary establish procedures under which the Secretary would review cases where a SPRE's
decision was clearly biased.

Many commenters believed that a State could develop due process procedures that met the minimum requirements outlined
in the NPRM, but those procedures would not be adequate or provide for a meaningful appeal. The commenters suggested
that final regulations (1) specify the time within which an institution could challenge an adverse action taken by
a SPRE, and (2) require a State to provide an institution the opportunity to present its case in a hearing before a third
party or impartial hearing official.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as amended by the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 101&hyph;542), the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;26), the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208). These regulations require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of higher education to disclose information about its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus safety policies and procedures, and statistics concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether certain crimes took place on campus. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also make technical changes to Subpart F of the Student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance General Provisions regulations, which governs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation. Encouraging students to pursue high quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary education is an important element of the National

On July 10, 1992 and October 22, 1993 the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR part 668 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 30826&hyph;30833 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58 FR 54902&hyph;54905, respectively). Both of these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations included a discussion of the major issues surrounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed changes that will not be repeated here. The list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preambles to the NPRMs on which a discussion of those issues may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be found. The final regulations to implement the Student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Right-to-Know Act, proposals for which were also included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 10, 1992 NPRM, are not included in these regulations. With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proliferation of completion and graduation rate provisions, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
became necessary to write a second NPRM regarding these rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary expects to publish the second NPRM this year. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not want to delay publication of final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding campus security and is, therefore, proceeding with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication separately. As indicated above, here is a summary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed issues relating to crime prevention and statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addition to student consumer provisions to require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure of an annual security report (57 FR 30828 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58 FR 54903); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(57 FR 30829 and 58 FR 54904, but superseded by subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 668.47(a)(12) of the final regulations has been changed to provide for the disclosure of certain policies
and procedures, the purpose of which is to prevent forcible and nonforcible sex offenses and address various issues
relating to these offenses. Institutions are required to establish campus sexual assault programs to prevent sex
offenses and procedures for a victim to follow when a sex offense occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.47(a)(6)(i) of the final regulations has been changed to provide that for the purpose of disclosing statistics
about campus crimes, institutions must compile and disclose statistics on rape for periods of time prior to August
1, 1992 and sex offenses, forcible and nonforcible, for periods of time on or after August 1, 1992. This change reflects
an amendment to section 485(f)(1)(F)(ii) of the HEA made by section 486(c)(1) of Public Law 102&hyph;325. An institution
must use the definition of rape through July 31, 1992 found in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Handbook. In addition,
an institution must use the definitions of forcible and nonforcible sex offenses found in the National Incident-Based
Reporting System (NIBRS) Edition of the UCR Handbook for collection of these statistics on or after August 1, 1992.

In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRMs, approximately 300 parties submitted comments on the proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters supported the intent of the statute and applauded the efforts to accurately collect and report
information on crime and educate consumers, and believe the regulations are a deterrent towards criminal activity.
The majority of commenters affirmed their support of the Secretary's removal of the term counselors from the proposed
definition of campus security authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters believed that the proposed regulatory definition of campus security authority struck the
appropriate balance between the needs of a crime victim and the need for crime reporting. Other commenters defended
the inclusion of deans and residence directors in the proposed definition, maintaining that the definition allows
victims to be served properly by reducing accusations concerning interference and coverup of crimes and, most importantly,
reducing the risk of someone else becoming a victim of crime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters believed that the proposed definition was too broad, particularly because it included deans and
residence directors. The commenters offered a variety of reasons for this belief, the most common reason being the
belief that a student who is a victim of rape, date rape, or similar crime will often solicit a dean or residence director
to help him or her work through the trauma of the event; the victim may decide not to file an official action with the legal
authorities. In these instances, the commenters believe the proposed rules could limit the victim's ability to receive
immediate assistance and would most likely prolong his or her trauma. Several commenters indicated that deans and
residence directors should play a strong role in educating students in security matters and in developing a disciplinary
environment that refuses to support criminal behavior.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters said that the regulations should not define the term campus security authority at all, thereby
ensuring maximum institutional flexibility with respect to the reporting of crimes and the allocation of counseling
responsibilities. The commenters suggested this course of action, stating that because of the variety of campus
administrative structures (size, complexity, structure, and staffing patterns), an all-inclusive definition
would be difficult to achieve. Other commenters said that the regulations should define the term but include only
specific campus officials, such as the chief law enforcement official on campus or the dean of students, or specific
offices, such as the campus security office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters specifically objected to including campus officials such as deans and residence directors within
the definition of campus security authority. These commenters advanced several arguments: Some commenters said
that students should be able to seek confidential counseling from such administrators before deciding whether to
report a campus crime and that by requiring these administrators to report possible crimes brought to their attention
by students, would undermine the usefulness of the administrators as student advisors and advocates; other commenters
noted that deans and residence directors are not trained in criminal law and that requiring them to report possible
crimes would probably lead to double-counting of crimes, once by the dean or other campus official and once by the campus
police. Several commenters noted that under the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uniform Crime Reporting
System, determining the number of crime counts is based on law enforcement investigation and does not include determinations
by persons, such as those that might be made by deans and residence directors, who are not law enforcement personnel.
Other commenters said it is unethical to require deans and residence directors to report crimes, that doing so is inconsistent
with the intent of Congress, and that the proposed definition does not clearly exclude campus religious authorities,
such as chaplains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters asked for clarification as to how the definition of a campus security authority relates to the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA requires institutions to disclose statistics of certain campus criminal offenses
reported to campus security authorities and local police agencies. As noted in the preamble to the first NPRM, the
proposed definition of campus security authority, which the statute does not define, represented an attempt to strike
an appropriate balance between the need of individual crime victims for confidential counseling and the need of the
broader campus community for prevention and a complete reporting of campus crime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary continues to believe that to achieve this balance, and to ensure consistent reporting of crime statistics,
it is necessary to define the term campus security authority and to include within the definition a wider range of campus
administrators than those exclusively devoted to criminal or security matters. Therefore, the definition of a campus
security authority includes a campus law enforcement unit, an individual or organization specified in an institution's
statement of campus security policy as the individual or organization to whom students and employees should report
criminal offenses, and an official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities,
but does not have significant counseling responsibilities. The Secretary does not agree that including a broader
range of administrators is unethical or unauthorized by the statute; neither is it inappropriate by virtue of their
lack of specific training in criminal law, nor is it likely to lead to double-counting. The function of these administrators
is not to determine authoritatively whether a crime took place_that is the function of law enforcement professionals
working within the criminal justice system_but, with respect to these regulations to report to the appropriate law
enforcement personnel, either campus or local police, those allegations of campus crimes that the administrators
conclude are made in good faith. These administrators would, of course, be free to seek advice from legal experts before
reporting any allegations. In addition, there is no penalty for reporting allegations of campus crime to the appropriate
law enforcement personnel if those allegations turn out to be baseless. If the law enforcement personnel, upon further
investigation, conclude that the allegations reported are not substantiated by the facts or the law, no campus crime
need be disclosed as a statistic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the wide variety of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary acknowledges
that it is not appropriate to identify particular administrators, such as deans and residence directors, by their
titles as being either included or excluded from the definition of campus security authority. Instead, the identifications
must be made in terms of the functions of particular administrators. Institutions are expected to determine which
officials have significant responsibility for student and campus activities and do not have significant counseling
responsibilities for the purpose of this definition and to make this information known to the campus community. The
Secretary notes that it was never the intent of the proposed rule to include chaplains within the meaning of the term
campus security authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records created and maintained by a campus law enforcement unit, for the purpose of law enforcement, are not education
records and are not protected from disclosure by FERPA. The definition of campus security authority also includes
(1) an individual or organization specified in an institution's statement of campus security policy as the individual
or organization to whom students and employees should report criminal offenses; and (2) an official of an institution
who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, but does not have significant counseling
responsibilities.

Information on crimes reported to these officials could be included in records classified as protected from non-consensual
disclosure under FERPA regulations. However, FERPA does not prohibit the disclosure of statistical, non-personally
identifiable information. The Secretary does not interpret FERPA to prevent compliance with the timely warning
provision, as in a case of an emergency involving the safety of others_even where the identity of an individual may
be disclosed.

should be reported, other officials of the institution who have significant responsibility for student and campus
activities, but only if those officials do not have significant counseling responsibilities. The definition has
also been revised expressly to include a campus law enforcement unit.

Under these final regulations, victims of a crime on campus remain free to seek confidential counseling from campus
administrators who have significant counseling responsibilities. Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA and these regulations
require the statistical reporting of crimes to the campus community, not personally identifiable accounts of crimes.
A victim who reports a crime to a campus security authority may, of course, request anonymity to the extent practicable
and permitted by local law.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested that the Secretary require institutions to monitor crimes that take place in areas other
than those proposed in the NPRM. For example, the commenters believe it is within the spirit of the statute to monitor
crime on public and private property that is not owned or controlled by an institution, but that is frequented by the
institution's students. This recommendation would include the neighborhood surrounding the campus. One commenter
indicated that there are many unidentifiable properties within the institution's area that are controlled by recognized
organizations, but that the properties of the organizations are not officially recognized by the institution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neither the HEA nor these regulations require institutions to gather data and report to the campus community about
off-campus crime. Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA and these regulations require institutions to disclose statistics
about particular crimes that occur on campus. The statute includes in the definition of ``campus'' any building or
property owned or controlled by student organizations recognized by the institution. Institutions should note,
however, that an institution can be considered to control certain space that may be owned by a third party. For example,
some institutions rent space in building owned by a third party; the institution controls the space that it occupies
and that space is covered under these provisions of the HEA.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested a clear definition of ``timely reports'' for the purpose of section 485(f)(3) of the HEA
and these regulations, which require an institution to make timely reports to the campus community on crimes that
are reported to campus security authorities or local police and that are considered a threat to other students and
employees. Some commenters believed that timely warnings made by those who are not enforcement personnel could jeopardize
a criminal investigation and allow a suspect to be released. Other commenters believe that the campus community must
be informed of these threats and these provisions allow the law enforcement authorities to receive the evidence to
build a case.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not believe that a definition of ``timely reports'' is necessary or warranted. Rather, the Secretary
believes that timely reporting to the campus community for this purpose must be decided on a case-by-case basis in
light of all the facts surrounding a crime, including factors such as the nature of the crime, the continuing danger
to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts. Campus security authorities
should consult the local law enforcement agency for guidance on how and when to release ``timely reports'' to the campus
community.

One commenter requested clarification as to the means of distribution of the annual security report. The commenter
wondered whether the institution would be required to mail the security report to current students and employees
or could simply notify them about how to obtain the security report. Another commenter requested the Secretary to
identify those to whom an annual security report is given only upon request.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations require that the annual security report be distributed to all current students and employees,
and to any prospective student and employee upon request. As defined in &sect;668.41(b), a prospective student is
one who has requested information concerning admission to the institution. However, because of the importance of
this information regarding personal safety, the Secretary believes that any person requesting information on admission
should be notified of the availability of the report, given a summary of the report, and given an opportunity to request
it. A prospective employee requesting an application for employment from the institution or information about employment
at the institution should be treated in the same manner as a prospective student. The Secretary agrees that these regulations
need to clarify how the report is distributed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations have been changed to clarify the methods of distribution that are to be used to ensure individual delivery
of the security report. An institution may choose to distribute the report by any of the following means: (1) Directly
mailing of the report to each individual through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or computer network; or (2)
providing the report directly to each individual (by hand-delivery). Institutions may include the security report
as a part of an institutional publication that is distributed to each individual, such as a catalog, student handbook,
registration materials, or tuition bill. An institution must provide prospective students and employees information
about the availability of the report and a summary of the information in it.

prescribed forms for the reporting of crime. The Secretary notes

that while the HEA does not mandate participation in the UCR

System, the HEA does, however, require use of the UCR definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining whether a crime has been committed.

Several commenters asked whether an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have programs to promote the awareness of rape, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquaintance rape, and other forcible and nonforcible sex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offenses is required to establish these programs itself. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asked whether an institution could use as educators, in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, personnel who are experts in their respective fields.

Section 485(f) of the HEA requires an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide education programs to promote the awareness of rape, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquaintance rape, and other sex offenses. An institution may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with experts in these areas, such as rape crisis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervention experts, local law enforcement officials, and social service personnel to provide training to students
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff.

Two commenters questioned the change in terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from sexual assault to sex offense with regard to procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students should follow if a sex offense occurs. Two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were concerned over the issue of preserving evidence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal offense: one commenter believed that this requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could place the institution in the position of interpreting laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding evidence. The institutions asked for guidance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to preserving evidence. Two commenters agreed that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student should retain the right, under the regulations, to decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to report a sex offense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary changed the term sexual assault to sex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offense to conform with the statutory provision requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to use the definitions of the FBI's UCR System; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forcible and nonforcible sex offenses are defined. During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiated rulemaking sessions with the academic community, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-Federal negotiators recommended that institutions be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to define what is meant by ``preserving evidence''. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urges institutions to consult with their campus security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials, local law enforcement officials, and the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prosecutor's office in addressing what constitutes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation of evidence. The Secretary further encourages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to develop working relationships with the emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rooms of local hospitals and local rape crisis programs.

One commenter asked to what extent an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to assist a student in notifying proper authorities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the occurrence of a sex offense, if the student requests the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's assistance.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fifteen commenters addressed the requirement for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to notify students that the institution will change a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
victim's academic and living situations after an alleged sex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offense and of the options for such changes, if changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested by the victim and are reasonably available. Some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commenters recommended that this should apply only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that have control over on- and off-campus housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some community colleges indicated that they do not have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience or resources to handle such a request. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were concerned that this requirement could impose an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlimited liability on institutions. Some of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asked the Secretary to specify what constitutes acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodation by an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to those commenters who expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern over potential legal liability and those who wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit the scope of this provision to institutions that control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing, it is important to recognize that these requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an institution flexibility. Moreover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 485(f)(7)(c) of the HEA provides that no private right of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is created by this statute. A change to accommodate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
victim must be reasonably available. If a change of living or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic situation requested by a victim is unreasonable, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is not required to make the change. As examples, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution could allow a victim out of a housing contract with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution so that the student may pursue off-campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing; on the other hand, if would not be reasonable to expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution to pay for the rental of a private apartment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student. The Secretary does not believe that it is useful to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list in these regulations all examples of acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodation. Institutions are expected to make reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts at acceptable accommodation.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters expressed concern that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not specified how an institution must ensure due process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accused in a campus disciplinary proceeding. The commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were concerned that the institution not take punitive action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the accused until all of the evidence is weighed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a conviction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters are correct that the HEA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide due process requirements under these provisions; due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is a matter of local law and other requirements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of this provision is to provide disclosure of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's disciplinary procedures with certain minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

A few commenters warned that the distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus security policies could be dangerous because criminal

The Secretary expects institutions to consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of the campus community for which they are providing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of campus security policies and to be judicious in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of information to be provided. The Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe the required disclosures will aid crime. Rather, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosures will serve to discourage crime on campus.

A few commenters said the statistics disclosed of

campus crimes should represent only verifiable crimes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convictions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The occurrence of a crime on campus need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed to students and staff under these regulations unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate law enforcement officials conclude that the crime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did occur with the same degree of certainty they would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of reporting under the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System. Convictions, however, are not required, because an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquittal means only that a specific defendant did not commit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crime charged, not that a crime did not occur. For information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning ``Unfounded Complaints'' an institution should refer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the UCR Handbook. The Secretary provided this clarification as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guide to disclosure requirements. It is in no way to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted as discouraging the reporting of crime to the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law enforcement agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with information collection requirements were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and explained in the NPRM. (Approved by the Office of

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government in the exercise of their governmental functions.

In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary amends the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended (HEA). The regulations implement new HEA statutory provisions that were added by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. In general, these new statutory provisions
tightened the eligibility requirements for institutions participating in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under title IV of the HEA (title IV, HEA programs). The regulations also clarify existing provisions,
and, in keeping with the statutory changes, tighten procedures governing institutional eligibility determinations.

With regard to the two-year rule, the Secretary provides exceptions to the requirement that the program an institution
lists on its initial eligibility application be substantially the same as the program it offered for two years preceding
that application. An institution may satisfy the two-year rule even if it substantially changed the subject matter
of its program over the two-year period if that change was made because of new technology or the requirements of other
Federal agencies. In addition, an applicant institution may count as part of the two-year rule any period during which
it was a branch campus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes also apply to the two-year rule for postsecondary vocational institutions in &sect;600.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary changed the manner in which an institution calculates whether it satisfies the 85 percent rule. Instead
of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds it received over an award year and the amount of revenues it
received over a fiscal year in the fraction set forth in &sect;600.5(d), institutions will use their latest fiscal
year to determine both amounts. Instead of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds received on a cash
basis of accounting and the amount of revenue received on an accrual basis of accounting, institutions will use a cash
basis of accounting for both title IV, HEA program funds and revenues. Institutions must report to the Department
of Education that they do not satisfy the 85 percent rule no later than 90 days after the last day of their fiscal year,
and institutions that fail to satisfy the 85 percent rule will become ineligible on the last day of their fiscal year.

Institutions may choose to have either the auditor who prepares its financial statement audit or the auditor who prepares
its title IV, HEA program compliance audit certify to the accuracy of its computations under the 85 percent rule, and
the auditor must submit that certification as part of that audit report. If the auditor determines that the institution
did not accurately calculate whether it satisfied the 85 percent rule, the auditor must include in the audit the correct
amount of title IV, HEA program funds and revenues the institution received in the fiscal year, and the correct ratio
under &sect;600.5(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed in &sect;600.5(d)(2)(v) that title IV, HEA program funds will be presumed to be used to satisfy
tuition, fees and other institutional charges unless these charges were satisfied with grant funds provided by sources
independent of the institution. This provision is changed so that the presumption would also not apply to institutional
charges that were satisfied with money provided through job training contracts under Federal, State, and local training
programs described in &sect;600.7(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When these regulations become effective on July 1, 1994, a proprietary institution must determine whether it qualifies
as an eligible proprietary institution for award year 1994&hyph;95 under the 85 percent rule. The Secretary has developed
special rules for this initial determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an institution's latest complete fiscal year ended during the period of October 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994, the
institution shall use that fiscal year to determine whether the institution satisfies the 85 percent rule. Such an
institution must notify the Secretary no later than September 30, 1994 if it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule, and
if the institution fails to satisfy that rule, it becomes ineligible on June 30, 1994. Therefore, as a general matter,
it will be liable for all title IV, HEA program funds it disbursed to its students for award year 1994&hyph;95. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an institution's latest complete fiscal year ends before October 1, 1993, the institution shall use the fiscal
year that ends between July 1, 1994 and September 30, 1994 as its latest fiscal year to determine whether the institution
satisfies the 85 percent rule. The institution must notify the Secretary if it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule
within 90 days following the end of that fiscal year, and if it fails to satisfy that rule, it becomes ineligible on the
last day of its fiscal year.

Section 600.7&blank;Conditions of Institutional Ineligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to qualify as an eligible institution, starting in award year 1994&hyph;95, an institution must not, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, be in violation of the limitations set forth in &sect;600.7. The provisions in that section implement the provisions
in sections 481(a)(3) and 481(a)(4) of the HEA. The former section was effective on October 1, 1992 while the latter
section was effective on July 23, 1992. Accordingly, institutions were subject to those provisions as of those dates.
Until July 1, 1994, the Secretary will view an institution as not violating those statutory limitations if the institution
can demonstrate, under a plausible interpretation of those statutory provisions, that it did not violate those limitations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 600.7 becomes effective on July 1, 1994, and &sect;600.7(a)(1)(i) implements section 481(a)(3). Under
&sect;600.7(a)(1)(i), the Secretary evaluates an institution's eligibility on the basis of the institution's
actions over the latest complete award year. Accordingly, as of July 1, 1994, the latest complete award year is the
1993&hyph;94 award year. Thus, for determining whether an institution qualifies as an eligible institution during
award year 1994&hyph;95, the institution will use award year 1993&hyph;94 for purposes of determining whether more
than 50 percent of its courses were correspondence courses, whether 50 percent or more of its enrolled regular students
were enrolled in correspondence courses, whether 25 percent or more of its enrolled regular students were incarcerated,
and whether 50 percent or more of its enrolled regular students had neither a high school diploma or its recognized
equivalent.

Waivers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution loses its eligibility if more than 50 percent of its regular students are enrolled in correspondence
courses. However, an institution that offers a 2-year associate-degree or 4-year bachelor's-degree program may
receive a waiver of that limitation for ``good cause.'' To receive a waiver, an institution can demonstrate ``good
cause'' if the students enrolled in the institution's correspondence courses receive no more than five (5) percent
of the title IV, HEA program funds received by all the students at that institution during its latest award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution loses its eligibility if more than 50 percent of its regular students do not have a high school diploma
or its recognized equivalent (ability to benefit [ATB] students). However, a nonprofit institution may receive
a waiver of this limitation if its enrollment of ATB students exceeded 50 percent of its total enrollment because it
served a substantial number of ATB students through contracts with Federal, State, or local government agencies
during its latest complete award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To receive a waiver, the contract must provide job training for low-income individuals who are in need of that training.
An example of such a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, an institution may receive a waiver only if no more than 40 percent of its enrollment of regular students
consists of ATB students who are not being served under the above-described contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under &sect;600.7, the waiver will extend indefinitely provided
that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year. If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements
for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that award year.

This section has been changed to provide that an eligible institution may not contract with an ineligible institution
for the latter to provide any portion of an educational program if the ineligible institution had ever been terminated
from participation in the title IV, HEA programs, or had ever withdrawn from such participation while under a termination,
show-cause, suspension, or similar type proceeding initiated by a State licensing agency, accrediting agency,
guaranty agency, or the Department of Education.

Section 600.30&blank;Institutional Notification Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A substantial number of institutions are structured as, or owned by, partnerships or limited partnerships. Customarily,
the governance of a partnership is vested in the ``general partners'' rather than in a ``board of directors,'' and
the management is under the control of one or more of the general partners rather than under an ``executive officer.''
Accordingly, the term ``a general partner'' is added to &sect;600.30(a)(7)(iv) to clarify that the Secretary considers
a person who is a general partner to be exercising substantial control over the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 600.31&blank;Change of Ownership Resulting in a Change in Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed apprehension about how the change of ownership rules affect sales in which the parties make
the sale conditional upon securing the Department of Education's certification for the institution under the new
ownership. The regulation has been changed to provide that the Secretary will review an application filed with respect
to a transfer that is subject to any contingency, provided that the sale was otherwise completed. A transfer that is
otherwise final is considered completed even if the seller retains a security interest in the institution or its assets
to assure satisfaction of payment of the purchase price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(i)(3) of the HEA provides that the transfer of the interest of an owner upon his or her death to a family member
or to a current owner may be excluded from its purview. This exclusion would apply readily to the kind of unexpected
transfers of control that would occur of necessity upon the death of an actively-managing principal of an institution
owned by a closely-held corporation. The regulation is changed to adopt the same description of the family of the owner
as that used in &sect;600.30(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation is modified to state that a change of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation occurs when
a person who holds or acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation acquires or relinquishes
control of 50 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation treats the change of control of a registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a
change of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. For other corporations not closely
held, the regulation treats as a change of ownership and control any action by which a person who has or thereby acquires
a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation obtains both ownership of 25 percent of the voting stock
of the corporation, or the right under a proxy, power of attorney, or similar agreement to vote that share, and actual
control. Conversely, relinquishing that control would also constitute a change within the meaning of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation clarifies that a change from a taxable to a tax-exempt entity that qualifies under section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code, or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vice versa,

Nearly all commenters confused the definition of the term ``branch campus'' with the provisions governing additional

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary defined the term ``branch campus'' narrowly in the NPRM and in this final regulation to enable institutions
to expand to serve the legitimate needs of students and communities not in close proximity to their main campuses without
having to undergo a full certification review. Under section 498(j) of the HEA, as amended by the Higher Education
Technical Amendments of 1993, to participate in the title IV, HEA programs, a branch campus must be certified by the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary under the provisions of subpart 3 of part H of title IV of the HEA. Thus, it must separately meet all of the applicable
requirements for participation contained in the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part
668. Because a full certification review is a complicated and lengthy process, the Secretary believes that a broad
definition of branch campus would capture numerous off-campus sites of institutions and would seriously deter institutions
from expanding to serve the legitimate needs of students and communities not in close proximity to their main campuses.
The narrow definition avoids this adverse impact. Instead, additional locations of an institution will not necessarily
be treated as branch campuses and thus will be subject to more moderate provisions elsewhere in this part, including
in &sect;600.32. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A branch campus located in a foreign country may not qualify as an eligible branch campus under the HEA because one of
the statutory requirements for eligibility (other than for purposes of the Federal Family Education Loan programs)
is that the branch be located in a State.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary indicated that a program that is part correspondence and part residential
is considered to be a correspondence program because ``This straightforward interpretation eliminates the need
for the Secretary to address all the troublesome issues involving the quantity of education that an institution claims
to provide in a correspondence program.'' The Secretary is still of that view.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters suggested broadening the definition of students who excelled academically in high school. They
suggested that persons in the upper quartile of their high school graduating class and persons who have passed standardized
tests be considered as having excelled in high school. One commenter asked the Secretary to remove this provision
because it could potentially be open to abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters noted that the Secretary proposed to consider an academic transcript resulting from the successful
completion of a two-year transfer program to be the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma and suggested that
the following transcripts also be so recognized: the transcript of a student who completed at least one semester or
quarter of a two-year transfer program; and the transcript of a student enrolled in a two-year program if most of the
credits in that program could be transferred to a bachelor's degree program.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma is generally a GED and the two provisions
discussed by the commenter apply only in exceptionally limited circumstances. Therefore, the Secretary does not
believe it useful to expand either provision at this time. The Secretary has reconsidered his position and no longer
believes that a student's class standing in high school is an adequate indication that the student excelled in high
school. The final rules reflect the Secretary's current policy in this area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters noted that while section 496(e) of the HEA required an institution to submit a dispute with an accrediting
agency regarding its loss of accreditation to initial arbitration prior to bringing other legal action, the NPRM
proposed requiring the institution to agree to binding arbitration. Most of these commenters were concerned that
requiring binding arbitration would violate an institution's right to have its case reviewed in court. Other commenters
noted that while institutions have to agree to binding arbitration, accrediting agencies do not have to so agree.
Another commenter asked whether an institution would retain its institutional eligibility under this part while
it undergoes binding arbitration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, the Secretary stated that he proposed that an institution agree to binding arbitration ``so that any legal
action after arbitration would be limited to whether the arbitrator's decision was arbitrary or capricious. The
Secretary believes that this approach best carries out the purpose of section 496(e) by limiting, to the maximum extent
possible, litigation in this area.'' The Secretary is still of this view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that the HEA does not specifically require an accrediting agency to agree to binding arbitration
but anticipates that accrediting agencies will agree to such arbitration without the necessity of a regulatory requirement
since it significantly limits the cost and length of appeals of their final decisions. Moreover, if an accrediting
agency does not agree to binding arbitration, institutions will be free to appeal their final adverse decisions in
federal courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an institution loses its accreditation as a result of a final accrediting agency action, it loses its eligibility
under this part because of its lack of accreditation. If it takes that accrediting agency to binding arbitration,
it will not regain that eligibility unless the arbitrator requires the agency to restore the institution's accreditation.

Other commenters were concerned that a new institution would not be able to make substantive changes in curriculum
to keep up with new technology and changes in industry and marketplace requirements. One commenter explained that
other Federal agencies may have regulations that affect course content and length and suggested that if the Secretary
retained language prohibiting institutions from changing courses substantially in content and length, the provision
be revised to allow for course content and length changes necessitated by regulations of other Federal agencies.
Another commenter was concerned that a new institution would never be able to change its courses. Other commenters
suggested that accrediting agencies and State Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) would monitor program integrity
and quality and a shorter period than two years could be used.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the Secretary indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, the purpose behind this provision is to prevent an institution
from offering a minimal program during the first two years of its existence and then expanding its programs when it
becomes eligible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the best way to support
this purpose is to require an institution to offer over the two-year period a training program that is substantially
the same in terms of subject matter and length as the training program it offers when it applies for institutional eligibility.
However, the Secretary agrees with the point made by some commenters that some flexibility should be provided with
regard to the subject matter of a program to take into account new technology and requirements of other Federal agencies.
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that an institution should be able to make substantive changes in
the subject matter of a program because of changes in market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers programs to be substantially the same if they are listed within the same generic series and
codes defined in Chapter I, Academic and Occupationally Specific Programs, published by the Secretary in the Classification
of Instructional Programs, Second Edition (1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers a program to be substantially the same in terms of length as the program the institution is
currently offering if the program offered over the two-year period would qualify the applicant to be an eligible proprietary
institution of higher education or eligible postsecondary vocational institution. Thus, in general, the program
must provide at least 20 weeks of instructional time and at least

A number of commenters discussed the presumption that title IV, HEA program funds are used to satisfy tuition, fees
and other institutional charges unless these charges were satisfied with grant funds provided by sources independent
of the institution. Commenters suggested that the above presumption should not apply if the tuition, fees and other
institutional charges were satisfied with money provided by other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans
Affairs, or through job training contracts under Federal, State, or local training programs, such as the Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA).

As indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary believes the definition of the term ``revenue'' establishes
a reasonable middle ground between counting only the income received from students' tuition and fees and counting
as revenue income from businesses that are owned and operated by the institution, regardless of the relationship
between the educational institution and the businesses.

A number of commenters suggested that revenue from contract training (on or off-site) provided by the institution
to business and industry be included as revenue in the denominator in &sect;600.5(d)(1) since this type of training
is directly related to the curriculum offered by the institution.

An institution can count as revenue only tuition, fees, and institutional charges for students enrolled in eligible
programs at the institution, and funds received for activities that are necessary to the education or training of
those students enrolled in eligible programs. Therefore, whether an institution can count as revenue in the denominator
of the fraction in &sect;600.5(d)(1) the revenue described by the commenters depends on whether an institution's
contract training programs qualify as eligible programs.

Several commenters suggested that an institution should be allowed to include institutional charges that were paid
by institutional scholarships and loans as revenue in the denominator of the fraction contained in &sect;600.5(d)(1).
One commenter said that his school awarded $1,000 institutional scholarships to all students in the second year of
their program. The commenter felt strongly that his institution should be able to include these scholarships as institutional
revenues.

 An institution is not prohibited from including institutional charges that were paid by institutional scholarships
and institutional loans as revenue in the denominator of the fraction contained in &sect;600.5(d)(1), provided
that the scholarships and loans are valid and not just part of a scheme to artificially inflate an institution's tuition
and fee charges. For this purpose, the Secretary does not consider institutional loans to be real unless such loans
are routinely repaid by the student borrowers. The Secretary does not consider institutional scholarships to be
valid if every student receives such a scholarship so that no student ever pays the claimed tuition and fee charges.
The Secretary considers the above-described practice of the commenter to be a classic example of this scheme. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this connection, the Secretary will scrutinize institutions that raise their tuition and fee charges to avoid

institutional scholarships and loans.

 A number of commenters suggested that non-need-based title IV, HEA program assistance, such as funds under the Federal
PLUS Loan Program, the Federal SLS Program, and the unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan Program, should not be included
in the numerator of the 85 percent rule calculation because it is unrealistic to penalize an institution whose students
chose to borrow under these programs.

 The statutory provision that established the 85 percent rule, section 481(b)(6) of the HEA, provides that an eligible
proprietary institution must have at least 15 percent of its revenues that ``are not derived from funds provided under
this title,'' i.e., title IV of the HEA. Section 481(b)(6) does not differentiate between ``need-based'' title IV,
HEA program funds and non-need-based title IV, HEA program funds. However, when determining the amount of title IV,
HEA program funds derived from FFEL programs or the Federal Direct Loan Program, the institution should only include
loan proceeds disbursed to students. It should not include the face amount of a loan because that amount includes loan
origination fees and loan guarantee fees that are not disbursed to students.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters pointed out problems with the fraction the Secretary proposed to determine whether an institution
satisfies the 85 percent rule. The commenters noted that the title IV, HEA program funds in the numerator were reported
on an award year basis but the revenues in the denominator were reported on a fiscal year basis. The commenters indicated
that when the institution's fiscal year does not coincide with an award year, the computation would not provide reliable
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a number of commenters raised concerns that the information reported in the numerator and denominator
would be produced under two different methods of accounting. Several auditing organizations noted that the title
IV, HEA program funds must be reported in the numerator on a cash basis of accounting (received). They further noted
that the revenue figure in the denominator would be verified through the use of a financial statement audit, and in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), financial statements are prepared on an accrual
basis of accounting. The commenters concluded that it does not make sense to compare the amount determined in the numerator
with the amount determined in the denominator when each number is determined under a different basis of accounting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees with the commenters about the deficiencies in the proposed rule and has made the following changes.
First, the Secretary agrees that there should be a common reporting period for the numerator and the denominator.
The Secretary will not require institutions to change their fiscal year to parallel an award year. Therefore, although
the Secretary will be giving up a degree of oversight, the Secretary will allow institutions to use their fiscal year
as the reporting period for the numerator as well as the denominator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, since institutions must report and account for title IV, HEA program funds on a cash basis, the institution
must also account for revenue in the denominator on a cash basis. Under a cash basis of accounting, the institution
reports revenues on the date that the revenues are actually received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution's computation must be verified as part of the institution's title IV, HEA program compliance audit
or as part of its financial statement audit. The institution may choose which audit will include the verification.

in the denominator of that fraction; institutions will report revenues in the denominator on a cash basis of accounting;
and institutional computations will be verified in financial statement audits or title IV, HEA program compliance
audits.

institution to compute its percentage of title IV, HEA program funds because of possible year-end adjustments and
because the institution's computation must be verified by the financial audit.

The Secretary agrees with the commenters that institutions may need an additional period to take possible year-end
adjustments into account. Therefore, the Secretary will allow an institution up to 90 days from the last day of its
fiscal year to report that it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule. However, if an institution determines that it fails
to satisfy the 85 percent rule, it will be ineligible as of the last day of that fiscal year; therefore the longer an institution
takes to report its ineligibility, the greater its potential liability for improperly disbursed title IV, HEA program
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that an institution does not need to wait for an audit to determine the percent of its revenue
that was derived from title IV, HEA program funds. The institution should be keeping track of these amounts over the
course of its fiscal year to avoid becoming ineligible. Moreover, since an institution must now determine its revenues
on a cash accounting basis, it is relatively easy for an institution to know its position relative to the 85 percent
rule.

 A number of commenters suggested that although an institution may give its best efforts to track revenues and keep
within the guidelines of the 85 percent rule, the institution will not know positively of the result until its annual
audited financial statement is completed. The commenters suggested that given the dire consequences of having title
IV, HEA program funds exceed 85 percent of its revenues, and the fact that a great many students could be potentially
harmed by such precipitous action, the Secretary should add a provision that allows an institution to voluntarily
refund any excess money to bring its percentage in compliance with the 85 percent rule.

 The purpose of the 85 percent rule is to preclude the participation in the title IV, HEA programs of proprietary institutions
of higher education whose overwhelming source of revenue is title IV, HEA program funds. The repayment of title-IV,
HEA program funds to the Department of Education is not consistent with that statutory purpose. Moreover, since a
refund of title IV, HEA program funds would reduce both the numerator and denominator of the fraction used to determine
this rule, any conforming refund would involve a significantly large amount of money.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 481(a)(3)(D) of the HEA provides that an institution that does not offer an associate or bachelor's degree
is not an eligible institution if more than 50 percent of its enrollment consists of students without a high school
diploma or its recognized equivalent (ATB students). As a result of an amendment by the Higher Education Technical
Amendments of 1993, the Secretary may waive the limitation for nonprofit institutions. However, to receive a waiver,
the institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it exceeds the limitation because it serves,
through contracts with Federal, State, or local government agencies, significant numbers of ATB students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments regarding the conditions under which the Secretary should grant this
waiver. Comments were particularly requested on the purpose of the referenced contracts, what constitutes a ``significant''
number of ATB students, and the duration of a waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that an institution should receive a waiver if the purpose of the referenced contracts is
to provide job training for low-income people who are in need of such services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that 20 to 25 percent of an institution's enrollment constitutes a significant number, another
suggested 40 percent, and yet another suggested 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that a waiver should be issued for a period of one year at a time, renewable on a yearly basis,
depending upon graduation and employment rates. A second commenter suggested that a waiver should be issued for the
duration of the certification agreement period. A third commenter suggested that the waiver should be issued for
the period in which the institution is in good standing with its accrediting agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of granting this waiver, the Secretary agrees with the commenters regarding the type of contract that
supports a waiver. The Secretary thus agrees that the contracts must provide job training for low-income individuals
who are in need of such services. An example of such a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership
Act (JTPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, to receive a waiver, an institution must demonstrate that its enrollment of ATB students exceeded 50 percent
of its total enrollment because it served a substantial number of those students through contracts. That is, the institution
must demonstrate cause and effect; it exceeded the statutory limit because it served a significant number of ATB students
through contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution cannot satisfy this waiver provision simply by demonstrating it served a large number of ATB students
under a contract. For example, if an institution's enrollment of ATB students who were not served under contract exceeded
51 percent of its total enrollment, that institution would not satisfy the waiver requirement regardless of the number
of additional ATB students it served under contract. Similarly, if an institution's enrollment of ATB students who
were not served under contract equaled 50 percent of its total enrollment, so that one additional ATB student would
put the institution over the 50 percent limitation, the institution would not satisfy the waiver requirement regardless
of the number of additional ATB students it served under contract. In neither case did the institution's enrollment
of ATB students exceed 50 percent of its total enrollment because it served a significant number of ATB students under
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the above, the critical factor in whether an institution qualifies for a waiver is the percentage of its enrollment
who are ATB students not being served under contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution is evaluated to determine whether it falls within the limitation set forth in &sect;600.7(a)(1)(i)
on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award-year basis. If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under this section, the waiver will extend indefinitely
provided that the institution satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year. If an institution fails to satisfy
the waiver requirements for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that award year. (This
policy is applicable to all waivers provided for under &sect;600.7.)

 One commenter noted that this section prevents an eligible institution from entering into an agreement with an ineligible
institution if that institution had its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs terminated by the
Secretary. The commenter suggested that this provision be expanded to prevent an eligible institution from entering
into an agreement with an ineligible institution that withdrew from participating in the title IV, HEA programs under
a show-cause or suspension order issued by the institution's State licensing agency, accrediting agency, guarantor,
State Postsecondary Review Entity (SPRE), or the Secretary. On the other hand, another commenter suggested removing
this provision entirely since it could eliminate teachout agreements when institutions close and could prevent
students from participating in valuable educational programs.

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter's suggestion that it is inappropriate for an eligible institution to contract
with an ineligible institution that had its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs terminated or
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrew from participating in the title IV, HEA programs under a termination, show-cause, suspension, or similar
type proceeding initiated by the institution's State licensing agency, accrediting agency, guarantor, or SPRE,
or by the Secretary. Moreover, the Secretary believes that this limitation should also apply to contracts under which
the ineligible institution provides 25 percent or less of the eligible institution's program. The Secretary believes
that there are a sufficient number of eligible institutions to allow teachouts of students whose institutions closed.

 Several commenters suggested that it is unfair to require that certain new educational programs have to be approved
by the Secretary as eligible programs before students enrolled in those programs would be eligible to receive title
IV, HEA program funds. The commenters felt that this would place an undue burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the institution and the students the institution is attempting to serve by creating delays in new program implementation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to the issuance of the Institutional Eligibility regulations in April of 1988, it was the Secretary's practice
to require institutions to apply to the Department of Education to have any new program designated as an eligible program
before students enrolled in that program could receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title IV, HEA program funds. The Secretary changed this practice in the regulation to reduce the burden on institutions
and the Department of Education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, an institution could determine on its own whether a new educational program qualified
as an eligible program. However, the institution would be liable for all title IV, HEA program funds it disbursed to
students enrolled in a new program if the institution incorrectly determined that the program qualified as an eligible
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has found that this new practice has not worked out. The Secretary has found that when institutions have
made incorrect determinations regarding whether a new educational program is an eligible program, the liability
associated with that incorrect determination was usually too high to be repaid. Moreover, this practice is inconsistent
with the new emphasis on ``gatekeeping'' as evidenced in Program Integrity Triad legislation, particularly with
respect to the certification process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has found that most problems in this area come from an institution offering new, short-term vocational
programs. Therefore in the NPRM, the Secretary has not required preapproval for new programs leading to an associate
degree or higher, or new vocational programs similar to the ones the institution already provides. The Secretary
retains this position in the final rule and believes that this procedure provides a proper balance between the need
of institutions to provide title IV, HEA program funds to students enrolled in new programs, and the need to limit abusive
practices of certain institutions.

 With regard to an institution's eligibility for purposes of the title IV, HEA programs, &sect;600.10(d)(1) provides
that an institution's eligibility designation for the title IV, HEA programs will expire when the institution's
program participation agreement expires. Section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule
for the expiration of those program participation agreements. When this schedule is established, the Secretary
will notify each institution well in advance of the scheduled expiration of its program participation agreement
of the need to reapply in order to continue its eligibility designation without interruption. Similarly, the Secretary
will provide each institution with the necessary information about the forms to use and the date by which the application
must be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once an institution has undergone a reapproval review, if it is approved, it will receive a program participation
agreement with a specific expiration date. Thereafter, it is the institution's responsibility to reapply for approval
to continue its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration date.

 Section 600.30 specifies the institutional changes of which the Secretary must be advised. Upon receipt of the notification,
the Secretary will advise the institution of any additional information that needs to be provided and whether the
institution needs to file an application. Section 600.20 identifies those key circumstances in which an institution
is always required to file an application. However, the Secretary retains the authority to request that an institution
undergo a reevaluation of institutional eligibility and certification whenever warranted. It should be noted that
the new institutional eligibility application will consist of a cover sheet plus separate schedules that deal with
the institution's additional locations, educational programs, boards of directors, etc. Thus an institution that
has a change in its board of directors or a change in the address of one of its locations may be asked to submit an application,
but that application may consist only of the application cover sheet and the appropriate schedule(s).

 A commenter expressed the view that the statute did not require that divisions, mergers or consolidations of public
or private non-profit institutions be treated as changes of ownership under section 498(i) of the HEA and objected
to their inclusion in the requirements of this section of the regulation. The basis for the comment is the list of examples
in section 498(e) of the HEA of an ``ownership interest.'' The commenter noted that these examples are not typical
of the ownership of public or non-profit entities.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. As indicated in section 498(e) of the HEA, the list of examples provided
is not exclusive, and the examples of change of ownership and control included in section 498(i) of the HEA include
transactions that public and non-profit institutions undergo, such as sales, mergers, and divisions. Therefore,
such changes of ownership and control are covered by &sect;600.31 and could cause the eligibility of those institutions
to lapse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to changes of ownership of non-profit institutions, where the non-profit institution is incorporated
as a stock corporation, the same bright lines used to identify changes of ownership constituting changes of control
for other stock corporations will apply. For non-profit institutions organized as member corporations, the corresponding
interest is the membership interest, and those rules should apply in the same way to changes in the membership of the
non-profit institutions. Changes of ownership and control also occur with regard to institutions that are owned
by non-profit corporations; changes in the persons or individuals who by virtue of their membership in the non-profit
corporation own the institution can result in a change of ownership and control of that institution. The bright lines
that identify changes of ownership and control of other corporations apply to changes in the membership of non-profit
corporations as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with any change of ownership, whether a transfer of the assets and educational enterprise of an institution
to another institution is a change within this section, or is subject to &sect;600.32 turns on whether the institution
continues to function as a separate educational enterprise after the transfer. If the entity that acquires the institution
continues the operation of that institution not as a separate institution but as part of another institution, the
transaction would be considered an acquisition of an additional location and would be subject to &sect;600.32.

 Commenters expressed apprehension about how the change of ownership rules affect sales in which the parties make
the sale conditional upon securing the Department's certification for the institution under the new ownership.
Commenters believed that the proposal that the Department would not review the school under the new ownership until
the sale has been completed would tend to foster undesirable disruption of title IV, HEA program funding and pose a
threat to continued training of students enrolled at the time of the sale. Commenters urged adoption of a procedure
in which the Department would review a proposed transfer of ownership before the consummation of the sale, so that
the sale could be aborted if certification were denied. A commenter suggested consideration of a preapproval procedure
described as used by other agencies in which the Department would review a proposed sale, and, if the institution under
the new ownership would qualify for certification, offer the certification on the condition that the sale be fully
consummated promptly.

 The Secretary recognizes the importance of reducing possible interruption in funding to the extent consistent with
the conduct of a responsible review of the financial and administrative capability of the school under new ownership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department currently reviews only transfers that have taken effect, and thereby have caused the eligibility
and certification of the institution to lapse, even if the transfer is subject to a condition

, such as obtaining the Department's approval and certification. The Department has taken this position because
it ensures that the parties submit only transfers under which the purchaser has conducted the requisite due diligence
to ensure that approval and certification will be granted. The Secretary believes this position is fair because the
regulations state fully the standards under which the qualifications of the school for certification will be measured,
and because virtually all the information on which approval of the institution under new ownership depends is fully
available to, and in many instances derived directly from, the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary sees no reason why a purchaser should not be able and expected to have made a fully informed decision to
purchase before submitting the application for certification. Unfortunately, in the past, purchasers have often
engaged in wholly inadequate due diligence, given scant professional attention to the requirements for participation
in the student assistance programs, and presented seriously deficient applications for approval. These deficiencies
unnecessarily consume Department review resources and needlessly delay approval decisions for the institution.
Lack of competent due diligence also results in other purchasers purporting to be unaware of problems with the qualifications
of the institution they have purchased that are serious enough to make Department approval impossible. The Secretary's
procedure for review of change of ownership applications will foster responsible and effective due diligence by
the purchaser.

 Several commenters believed that a transfer of ownership to a person who had been engaged in management of the school
should not be considered a change within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. Others urged excluding transfers
of ownership interests among current shareholders, particularly if the institution was owned by a close corporation
and the shareholders had held those interests for several years or the shareholder acquiring the controlling interest
had been engaged in managing of that institution. Other commenters urged that transfers of controlling ownership
interests from the owner upon retirement to a shareholder currently involved in management of the school be excluded
from changes in ownership within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 498(i) of the HEA requires an institution to reestablish its educational credentials and its administrative
and financial capability after a change of ownership and control. Transfers of ownership commonly take place between
those holding the controlling interest in the institution and individuals who have been managing the institution.
While there may often be a continuity of management and administration through such transfers of ownership, the financial
capability of the institution after the current managers assume controlling ownership interests may be dramatically
different than under the prior owner, particularly where the transaction is structured as an asset sale rather than
a stock transaction. The fact that the new owner already had an ownership interest, or was involved in management of
the institution, or both, does not provide assurance that scrutiny can responsibly be waived for those reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(i)(3) of the HEA does provide that the transfer of the interest of an owner upon his or her death to a family
member or to a current owner 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be excluded from its purview. This exclusion would apply readily to the kind of unexpected transfers of control that
would occur of necessity upon the death of an actively-managing principal of an institution owned by a closely-held
corporation. However, the rationale for deferring to this humanitarian objective of facilitating a smooth transition
in this narrow circumstance does not support waiving otherwise-mandated scrutiny in a broader range of transfers
involving corporations that are not closely held, or planned transfers to those who have neither an ownership interest
nor any managerial involvement in the institution. The Secretary considers it prudent to limit the waiver at this
time only to those transfers of the interest of a deceased or retiring owner either to one who is a current manager and
owner of the institution or to an immediate family member, and to evaluate the consequences of this kind of waiver,
before considering further waivers.

 Most commenters welcomed the adoption of bright-line tests for identifying changes of ownership and control, and
the use of the acquisition or relinquishment of a 50 percent interest in the institution or its owner was generally
agreed as a suitable line. Some commenters stressed the importance of looking to control rather than simply percentage
of ownership interest, and urged that a transfer of ownership interest between active and passive investors be disregarded
if the transfer did not change the control of the institution.

 In proposing that the term ``control'' as used in section 498(i) of the HEA and current regulations be interpreted
with reference to SEC regulations, 17 CFR part 230.405, the Secretary intended to recognize that ``the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract,
or otherwise,'' included the power held by a managing partner or active investor to effectively direct the decisions
and policies of the partnership or corporation. Therefore, the intent and effect of the proposed rule was to recognize
that a transfer of an ownership interest to one who holds some ownership interest and who already had the power to direct
the management of the entity does not constitute a change of ownership resulting in a change in control. Such transfers
do not fall within the purview of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although there appeared to be general support for adoption of the 50 percent standard for identifying the possession
of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation, the manner in which this was described suggested some need
to reaffirm how the test would actually apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In interpreting section 498(i) of the HEA, which does not itself define change of ownership resulting in a change in
control, but gives as examples of such changes a list taken almost verbatim from Department regulations in effect
for many years, the Secretary considers Congress to have intended that the mandate of section 498(i) of the HEA be applied
in situations that would have triggered changes under the Department's regulations. Like the SEC definition of control,
with which businessmen and practitioners can be expected to be already thoroughly familiar, both the proposed rule
and current Department regulations focus on the acquisition_through ``any action''_of ``new authority to control
the actions of the institution'' by one with a legal or beneficial ownership interest in the entity. A person may already
have acquired an ownership interest and then acquire such new authority, or may in a single transaction acquire both
an ownership interest and control. In either case, the transaction changes the control group for that institution
to a degree that warrants the scrutiny mandated in section 498(i) of the HEA. Actions by which a person who has no legal
or beneficial ownership interest gains or loses ``control'' are not changes of ownership and control within the meaning
of the regulation unless the person acquires an ownership interest in that action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the 50-percent test is simply meant to identify those situations in which a person becomes owner or controller
of the majority of the voting stock of a closely-held corporation. Conversely, the power to direct the management
and decisions of the corporation can reasonably be presumed to change, and therefore to warrant scrutiny of the continued
capability of the institution, when a person who held control of the majority of the stock loses that control, even
if no other single person thereby gains that control. The test is met therefore when a person with an ownership interest
in any amount acquires control of 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or when a person who
has an ownership interest and control of 50 percent of the voting stock relinquishes that degree of control. Very small
changes in ownership and/or control can be enough to change control. To control a closely-held corporation, a person
who already holds an ownership interest need not acquire an additional 50 percent share in order to control the corporation;
a shareholder with ownership or control of 49 percent of the voting stock need only acquire either ownership or control
of another percent of that stock to achieve at very least equal power with any other person, and by acquiring an added
two percent, would hold greater power than any other person to direct the management and policies of the corporation.
Relinquishing those minor shares of control results in the person having less than control of a majority of the voting
stock of the corporation, and causes a change of ownership and control of the corporation.

Commenters generally agreed that for those corporations whose stock is registered with the SEC, using the events
that would constitute a change of control of the corporation so as to trigger an obligation to file an SEC Form 8&hyph;K
would be a suitable bright line for identifying changes of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i)
of the HEA for institutions owned by those corporations. Commenters differed in their reactions to the proposal to
adopt a 25 percent ownership interest with actual control as the test for corporations that are neither closely held
nor registrants with the SEC. Still others thought that the 25 percent test should be used even for SEC registered corporations.
Other commenters believed that the 50 percent test applied to closely-held corporations should be used for all others
as well.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier and as apparent from a number of the comments, SEC registrants already have an obligation, with which
they are presumably comfortable and familiar, to notify the SEC when management identifies a change of control, which
presumably is invariably accompanied by, or presupposes, the acquisition of an ownership interest. Because of this
obvious familiarity of the affected parties, the relative similarities of the objectives of the two rules, and the
difficulty in creating any new bright line that would be meaningful in this area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the SEC test makes good sense for publicly-traded corporations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For corporations that are neither closely held nor publicly traded, creating a bright line is difficult, and it is
desirable therefore to use, to the extent practical, regulatory standards that have already applied to this category
of institutions. As the Secretary noted in proposing the rule, Department regulations have recognized that a person
who holds or acquires the power to vote a 25 percent ownership interest may reasonably be presumed to have the ability
to ``affect substantially the actions of the institution.'' (See 34 CFR part 668.13(c)(5)(i), [or, in the words of
the proposed &sect;668.15(c)(1), (f)(2), to ``exercise substantial control over an institution.'' February 28,
1994, 59 FR 9568&hyph;69].) ``Substantial'' control may differ from control, and the presumptions in that section
are warranted for persons with records of misfeasance with title IV, HEA program funds, but may not warrant the disruption
of mandated scrutiny for transfers of ownership and control involving other persons. Because of the wide variety
of circumstances and institutions that may be neither closely held nor publicly traded, the use of this same bright
line where it is also accompanied by real control_judged by the facts of the particular case_seems a fair test that
should be consistent with, and build on, current standards. Acquisition of a 25 percent ownership interest, or the
right to vote such an interest, with actual control, constitutes a change within the meaning of section 498(i) of the
HEA for these corporations. Holding or acquiring such an ownership share would not constitute a change of control
if another person nevertheless had the power to control the corporation.

The regulation treats the change of control of a registrant with the SEC as a change of ownership and control within
the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. For other corporations not closely held, the regulation treats as a change
of ownership and control any action by which a person who has or thereby acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest
in that corporation obtains both ownership of 25 percent of the voting stock of the corporation, or the right under
a proxy, power of attorney, or similar agreement to vote that share, and actual control. Conversely, relinquishing
that control would also constitute a change within the meaning of this section.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters believe that a change from a for-profit to a nonprofit status should not be considered a change of ownership
and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA at all; others thought that so long as management remained
the same, or the facility, staff, and management remained the same, that the regulations should not treat changes
in tax-filing status as significant under section 498(i) of the HEA. Other commenters felt strongly that a change
from for-profit to nonprofit status should be considered a change of ownership and control within the scope of this
section, and noted the various changes already made in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and in particular
those proposed in regulations, that were designed to prevent program weaknesses and abuse among for-profit institutions.
The commenter stated that these measures would readily be frustrated by unscrutinized conversion to nonprofit status,
and would be contrary to the objectives of increasing protection for students and the public. The commenter believed
that there was little reason to expect that the institution would improve its financial strength by such a conversion,
and that it may in fact have increased its liabilities in the process, yet under the proposed financial responsibility
standards, the school upon conversion would claim the benefit of a more lenient financial responsibility test than
that which it would have faced had it remained a for-profit entity.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that institutions that change from for-profit to nonprofit status may well retain the very
same faculty, management, programs and facilities. The very fact that the institution retains these characteristics
through the conversion, however, points out the logic of ensuring that section 498(i) of the HEA be applied to these
conversions in a way that is consistent with congressional intent to impose a range of precautions and restrictions
on for-profit vocational schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the strong congressional intent evidenced in these statutory changes to restrict title IV, HEA program participation
by proprietary trade schools, the Secretary considers it reasonable to treat changes in business form by such institutions
to a status to which those restrictions do not necessarily apply as significant changes warranting the same scrutiny
section 498(i) of the HEA dictates for other, perhaps far less consequential changes in governance by schools. Moreover,
a change from taxable to nonprofit, tax-exempt status contains sufficient elements of a change in ownership and control
to fall within the scope of section 498(i) of the HEA. Although changes in the form of incorporation from for-profit
to nonprofit are governed by a variety of State laws, only those nonprofit organizations that meet the further restrictions
of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code qualify to participate in the title IV, HEA programs as nonprofit
institutions. (See 34 CFR 600.2 and 600.6(a).) To so qualify, a corporation must not merely ensure that its net earnings
do not benefit private individuals, but that, unlike a general corporation that may engage in any lawful business,
this nonprofit institution must be organized and operated exclusively for educational or other qualifying purposes.
Furthermore, unlike other corporations, including those nonprofit institutions that are not tax-exempt, the incorporators
or shareholders must forego any residual claim to a distribution of corporate assets upon dissolution of the corporation.
Acceptance of these restrictions include relinquishment both of ownership rights and the independence in choice
of business objectives and method of operation formerly enjoyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, although a corporation may affect the change in form from taxable to tax-exempt, nonprofit status with
little formality, and may not be required, under local law, to reconstitute itself as a new or different corporation,
these consequences of the change make it a change cognizable under section 498(i) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is charged by section 498(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the HEA with provisionally certifying institutions that
undergo a change of ownership and control. Provisional certification means, as the Department has spelled out in
proposed &sect;668.13(c)(4)(ii), 59 FR 9564, certification subject to conditions, and the change from for-profit
to nonprofit status warrants adopting as those conditions of the required provisional certification those restrictions
that would have applied to the institution had it remained a for-profit entity. The Secretary therefore expects to
include such provisions for a limited period in certifications given to converting schools.

Nine commenters expressed concern that the provisions governing the acquisition of an institution that owes a liability
on improperly expended or unspent title IV, HEA program funds would discourage the practice of ``teaching out.''
A commenter suggested that the Secretary should not apply the ``two-year rule'' to the acquisition of an institution
owing a liability on title-IV, HEA program funds, even if the liability is not being paid properly. Another commenter
suggested that the Secretary make clear that the eligibility of additional locations under this section is also subject
to the provisions of &sect;&sect;600.8 (concerning the treatment of branch campuses) and 600.10 (which contains
provisions governing the date, extent, duration, and consequences of the eligibility of an institution with respect
to the institution's locations).

has seen no evidence that the provisions discourage ``teach-outs'' to students, or that the application of the ``two-year
rule'' has not served its purpose. The Secretary agrees with the last commenter that clarification is necessary with
regard to the relationship of this section to &sect;&sect;600.8 and 600.10.

(see 59 FR pages 9580&hyph;9581) that will go into effect on July 1, 1994, provisions have been made to pay title IV,
HEA program funds to students enrolled in institutions that are terminated. Under those sections, if termination
became effective during a payment period and a student had received a commitment to receive title-IV, HEA Program
funds for that payment period before the effective date of termination, the student would receive those funds for
that payment period as long as the institution continued to provide instruction to the student during that payment

Several commenters suggested that the end of the applicable award or fiscal year should not be used as the effective
date for loss of eligibility as a result of a violation of the requirement to derive more than 85 percent of an institution's
revenues from title IV, HEA program funds. They pointed out that the loss of eligibility has the effect of causing an
institution to be liable for any title IV, HEA program funds disbursed or delivered after that date but before a compliance
audit substantiating the institution's calculations is performed. These commenters suggested that institutions
not be held liable for any such disbursements or deliveries of those funds made before the date on which calculations
are audited.

Three commenters supported the Secretary's proposed position in this section to use a show-cause proceeding for
terminations of institutional eligibility only in instances where neither the facts nor the law would be in dispute
during the proceeding. Two commenters objected to the use of a show-cause proceeding (in place of a proceeding under
34 CFR part 668, subpart G) for terminations of institutional eligibility for a violation under &sect;&sect;600.5(a)(8)
or 600.7(a), claiming that violations of these provisions could involve questions of fact that are in dispute. A commenter
also objected to the use of a show-cause proceeding (in place of a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G) for terminations
for loss of accreditation, preaccreditation, or State legal authorization. One commenter suggested that the Secretary
always use a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, for violations of provisions in part 600. One commenter suggested
that the Secretary always use a show-cause proceeding, rather than a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, for
terminations of institutional eligibility.

The Secretary reiterates that because an institution itself reports that it is not in compliance with the applicable
eligibility requirements of &sect;&sect;600.5 or 600.7, there is no question of fact in dispute in a termination
action taken on those grounds. The Secretary continues to believe that a termination proceeding under 34 CFR part
668, subpart G, is neither necessary nor cost effective when facts are not in dispute. The Secretary agrees, however,
that it is appropriate to use the provisions of 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, when the Secretary undertakes to terminate
an institution's eligibility when the facts giving rise to that termination are in dispute. However, even with regard
to these institutions, the Secretary may take an emergency action against such an institution if that action is considered
warranted, and if the institution challenges the emergency action, that dispute is heard in a show-cause proceeding.

(2) For purposes of participating in a title IV, HEA program, if an eligible institution seeks eligibility for a location
or educational program not previously designated eligible, and the Secretary determines that the location or educational

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the Secretary determines that the entire applicant institution, including all its locations and all its educational
programs, satisfies the applicable requirements of this part, the Secretary extends eligibility to all educational
programs and locations identified on the institution's application for eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Secretary determines that only certain educational programs or certain locations of an applicant institution
satisfy the applicable requirements of this part, the Secretary extends eligibility only to those educational programs
and locations that meet those requirements and identifies the eligible educational programs and locations in the
eligibility notice sent to the institution under &sect;600.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Eligibility does not extend to any location that an institution establishes after it receives its eligibility
designation if the institution provides at least 50 percent of an educational program at that location, unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to have that additional program designated as an eligible program of that institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An eligible institution that adds an educational program after it has been designated as an eligible institution

of that institution if the additional program_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) Leads to an associate, baccalaureate, professional, or graduate degree; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) If an institution incorrectly determines under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that an educational program
satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory eligibility provisions without applying to the Secretary for

that educational program, and all the title IV, HEA program funds received by or on behalf of students who were enrolled
in that educational program.

(1) If an institution participates in the title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary's designation of the institution
as an eligible institution under the title IV, HEA programs expires when the institution's program participation
agreement, as described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, expires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an institution participates in an HEA program other than a title IV, HEA program, the Secretary's designation
of the institution as an eligible institution, for purposes of that non-title IV, HEA program, does not expire as long

(2) If, as part of its institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it does not wish to participate
in any title IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the institution is eligible to apply to participate
in any HEA program listed by the Secretary in the eligibility notice it receives under &sect;600.21. However, the

of its designation as an eligible institution under this part.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary amends the Student Assistance General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions regulations, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program regulations, and the Federal Pell Grant Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1965, as amended (HEA), and to improve the monitoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability of institutions and third-party servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in the student financial assistance programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes also establish standards of administrative and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility for third-party servicers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer any aspect of a guaranty agency's or lender's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student aid programs and, by so doing, to improve their capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary invites comment on these regulations.

Technical Amendments of 1993) amended the HEA in several areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the participation of institutions in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 9526). The NPRM included a discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of those issues can be found:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (pages 9529&hyph;9530); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed a definition of an eligible program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement statutory requirements, including requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposed methodologies for the measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and placement rates for short-term programs, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the statute. Also in accordance with the statute, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary proposed further provisions to evaluate the quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of short-term programs (pages 9530&hyph;9531); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to add two new sections to codify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures with regard to applications to participate initially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA program and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposed procedures to codify new statutory provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing provisional certification procedures for participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a Title IV, HEA program (pages 9533&hyph;9536); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the regulations governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreements to include numerous new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically spelled out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulations. The Secretary also proposed provisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend the regulations governing program participation agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(pages 9536&hyph;9539); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed significant changes to the section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing the evaluation of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. The Secretary proposed to strengthen the factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to evaluate an institution's financial responsibility and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect statutory changes (pages 9539&hyph;9544);

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposed to strengthen and expand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of administrative capability for participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, addressing areas previously not regulated or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which there were only guidelines (pages 9544&hyph;9549); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the provisions governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default reduction measures to reflect statutory changes made by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Amendments of 1992 and current departmental practices. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional appeals of cohort default rates were not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the NPRM (pages 9549&hyph;9551); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to clarify the terms used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund policy (pages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9551&hyph;9556); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to implement the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that institutions have annual compliance audits. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposed to extend the audit requirements to foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions (pages 9556&hyph;9557); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to amend the Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program regulations to implement section 487(c)(7) of the HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides that an institution may offset the amount of Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program disbursements against liabilities or may receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement from the Department for those amounts if, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution has provided to its students in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements, but the institution has not previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(page 9558). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 17, 1994, the Secretary published an NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing amendments to parts 668 and 682 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(59 FR 8044). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in the proposed changes. The following list summarizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on which a discussion of those issues can be found: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed a definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
third-party servicer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an institution to administer any aspect of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs (page 8045); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to expand the factors of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of an institution to take into consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial control over both institutions and third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers (pages 8046&hyph;8047); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed annual audit requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers as necessary to implement statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions under the Amendments of 1992 (pages 8047&hyph;8048); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed notification requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers against which the Secretary has assessed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(pages 8048&hyph;8049); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to create a new section to codify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract requirements between institutions and third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers. As one of the conditions in the contract, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer would be required to assume joint and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several liability with an institution that the servicer contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirement (pages 8049&hyph;8050); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to apply against a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer the sanctions under subpart G of the Student Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions that currently solely apply to institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(pages 8050&hyph;8051); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to apply the fiduciary standards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently only apply to institutions to third-party servicers so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that third-party servicers would be required to act at all times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the competency necessary to qualify them as a fiduciary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(page 8051); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed a definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
third-party servicer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a lender or guarantee agency to administer any aspect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender's or guarantee agency's participation in the FFEL programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(page 8055); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed to require a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contracts with a lender or guaranty agency to assume joint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and several liability for any violation of any FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement or applicable statutory requirement. Collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities from the violation would be collected first from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender or guaranty agency (page 8055&hyph;8056); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposed a new section to codify Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for third-party servicers that contract with lenders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or guaranty agencies. A third-party servicer would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet certain standards of financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability to be considered eligible to contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a lender or guaranty agency. In addition, this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require a third-party servicer to have performed an annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit of the servicer's administration of a lender's or guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's participation in the FFEL programs (page 8056);

Program Integrity Triad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the student financial assistance programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized under Title IV of the HEA (referred to as ``Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs'') and many other Federal programs, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that definition requires an eligible institution of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quality of the education or training provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary level in the State in which it is located. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must be certified by the Secretary as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA provides the framework for a shared responsibility among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those institutions that provide students with quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training worth the time, energy, and money they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triad.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bodies must meet if they are to be recognized by the Secretary as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for States: the State Postsecondary Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require leadership in both implementation and evaluation if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will take steps to assure that the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of either the quality of education they offer or their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is committed to carrying out the responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinating the activities of the triad members that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in the statute in a manner that causes the least burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review carefully the applications of accrediting bodies and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and operating plans proposed by State Postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program to insure that they meet the requirements of the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill their statutory purposes. The Secretary will also place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which will contain the information that the Secretary generates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary will use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn carry out their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's effective selection of institutions for program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important key to effective management. The Secretary will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department to determine their effectiveness in improving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will take such steps as may be indicated to improve the results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advice and counsel of the National Advisory Committee on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the triad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary one, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state required for participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review criteria related to institutional performance in the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions is on the administrative and financial capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the functions and responsibilities of each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triad members are generally different, the statute does require, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from different perspectives for different purposes. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all three of the triad members are required to examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finances of an institution. If each looks at financial strength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a perspective complementary to that of the others, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies would focus principally on the capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality sufficient to meet accrediting agency standards and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill the institution's mission over a 5&hyph;10 year period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accreditation. The emphasis of a review by a SPRE would be on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not the institution possesses the full range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources needed to serve students currently attending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's finances in light of its ability to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services described in its official publications and statements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the
Secretary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to three different standards regulating the same area of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary expects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing their own standards to insure that varying standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important that accrediting agencies and States do not impose any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard that is weaker than comparable Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. The Secretary believes coordination of this is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the complementary approach to the functions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions should not have to develop different methodologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide data that the three members of the triad may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other requests for data about the institution, its students, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its graduates should rely on information already in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's possession. To that end, the Secretary expects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the methodology that will be specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or, where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as a system designed to provide data to a State higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format already being used by the institution. Similarly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audited financial statements institutions are now required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted under their respective standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those included in part H. The suggestion has been made that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlap so that institutions would not be subject to varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members. However, the Secretary interprets part H as permitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as opposed to using a Federal standard, and also believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear how the requirements of the different agencies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these programs administered by other agencies may be very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative. The Secretary does believe that it would be useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are similar to those of part H might be coordinated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the national level should be made available to institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In particular, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fields and information concerning graduation and withdrawal rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members and institutions. The Secretary will facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of this type of information and, where possible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the auspices of the Department, will coordinate the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.

Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triad members and institutions to exchange information about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gatekeeping process and to discuss how the triad is functioning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both in identifying institutions whose performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questionable and in reporting requirements that have proven to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the functioning of the triad, as it is implemented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through these and other regulations governed by part H. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will seek improvement, where possible, within existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute itself if experience indicates those changes are both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on how to implement the technical amendment that provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, the required minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not less than 26 weeks of instructional time in the case of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program of instruction for which it awards an associate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baccalaureate degree. The Secretary did not propose specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria to implement this technical amendment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 28, 1994 NPRM, but instead requested comments on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``good cause'' and requested comments on ways of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing this provision that addressed the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern that reductions in the award year would encourage many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to seek that treatment routinely. After reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comments on defining good cause, and developing safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to discourage routine requests for reductions in the academic year, the Secretary has implemented this technical
amendment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new &sect;668.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this section, for the purpose of awarding Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA funds, the Secretary may reduce the length of an academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for an institution that submits a written request to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. Section 668.3 provides for a two-year ``phase-in'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for institutions that are currently participating, have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic year of 26&hyph;29 weeks, and meet the other applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of the section. The Secretary will consider all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests for a reduction in the minimum number of weeks of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional time to not less than 26 weeks on a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis in accordance with the requirements of &sect;668.3. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.3 is discussed in greater detail in the section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that addressed the definition of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (&sect;668.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on how to address an abuse of the definition of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
whereby an institution that has programs that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in credit hours without terms could claim that it meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements for the minimum amount of work to be performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a full-time student over an academic year by giving a full-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time student a minimal amount of instruction over a 30-week (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more) period, which the institution claims to be equivalent to 24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semester or 36 quarter hours. The Secretary requested comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a minimum full-time workload for students enrolled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these educational programs should be established to address this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse. Several commenters agreed that this abuse should be addressed. However, rather than changing the proposed
definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of full-time student to require measurement of student workloads, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a modification has been made to require that, for educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs using credit hours, but not using a semester, trimester, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or quarter system, a week of instructional time is any week in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which at least five days of regularly scheduled instruction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations, or preparation for examinations occurs, as opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to one day of regularly scheduled instruction, examinations, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation for examinations for all other programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is important to ensure that full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students are performing comparable workloads regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of institution they are attending, and that such work should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ratably allocated throughout the period of instruction. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary notes that this is an area of abuse that is not fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by the implementation of the ``clock hour/credit hour'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. A corresponding change has been made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
eligible program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One-third of an academic year and two-thirds of an academic year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, the Secretary has defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-third of an academic year and two-thirds of an academic year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to clarify the procedure for prorating awards under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL and NDSL programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Undergraduate student.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the Secretary recognizes that, at this time, there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legitimate reasons supported by statute for separate definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
under the various Title IV, HEA

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

has

Qualitative factors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 668.8(e)(1)(iii) requires that, for a short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, the length of the program may not exceed by more than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent the minimum number of clock hours required for training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the recognized occupation for which the program prepares 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, as established by the State in which the program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered, if the State has established such a requirement. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to public comment, this provision has been amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also prohibit a short-term eligible program from exceeding by 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent any applicable minimum number of clock hours required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
agency for training in the recognized occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the program prepares students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.8(e)(2) has been revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify that, since a certified public accountant cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify the accuracy of an institution's completion or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement-rate calculations, the institution shall substantiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these calculations by having the certified public accountant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow the procedures of an attestation engagement.

Calculation of completion rate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 668.8(f)(4) has been amended to require that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student must complete the educational program in which he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is enrolled within 150 percent of the published length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program in order to be counted as a completer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this calculation. This change was made to conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the calculation of a completion rate under the Student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Right-to-Know provisions. The Secretary notes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department will continue to evaluate the feasibility of replacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this methodology with the methodology developed relative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Student Right-to-Know Act once that methodology has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in final regulations.

&sect;668.8(g)(1)(ii) that an institution exclude from the calculation

of a placement rate students who are hired by the institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been deleted from these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, a change has been made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rate calculation to clarify that every student must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed for at least 13 weeks in a recognized occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before that student can be counted as placed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has amended &sect;668.8 by revising paragraph (k) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remove the provision that an institution offering an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate educational program measured in credit hours and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least two academic years in length is exempt from applying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula contained in paragraph (l) to that program if the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides an equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if each course within the program is fully acceptable for credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward that institution's equivalent degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (k) and (l) were originally published in final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39618). In those final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the Secretary exempted from the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, undergraduate educational programs that were at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least two years in length and lead to an associate, bachelor's, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional, or an equivalent degree as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or if each course within that program was fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable for credit toward one of those degree programs at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that institution. The Secretary believed that it was prudent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt programs that lead to an equivalent degree because there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be a type of degree being offered (not an associate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bachelor's, or professional degree) that the Secretary had not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yet encountered. The Secretary wanted to be able to examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree to determine if that degree was in fact equivalent to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate, bachelor's, or professional degree. If the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the degree was equivalent to an associate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bachelor's, or professional degree, and was at least two academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years in length, the Secretary would exempt from the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate educational programs that lead to the equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree or if each course within the program was fully acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for credit toward that institution's equivalent degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since publication of the final regulations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 23, 1993, the Secretary has yet to encounter a degree that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary would consider to be an equivalent of an associate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bachelor's, or professional degree. Conversely, dozens of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions have submitted to the Secretary arguments that their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diploma programs are the equivalent of an associate degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The regulations were never meant to permit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that a nondegree program be classified as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of a degree program. The regulations only applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a determination of whether a degree resulting from an educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is equivalent to an associate, bachelor's, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional degree. Because the diploma programs are not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves degree programs, the Secretary does not consider those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs to lead to an equivalent degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of this misconception by many institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``equivalent degree'' means an educational program equivalent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree granting program, and because the Secretary has not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found a true instance of an equivalent degree that is not an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate, bachelor's, or professional degree, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the phrase ``equivalent degree as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary'' from paragraph (k).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to concerns of many commenters about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences (particularly the potential for provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification) to a participating institution in the event that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary does not complete a review of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application prior to the expiration of the institution's program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement, even if the institution had filed its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal application in a timely manner, &sect;668.13(b) is amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that full certification will be extended on a month to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month basis following the expiration of a program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement where the institution's application for recertification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was materially complete, and submitted at least 90 days prior to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisional certification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, proposed &sect;668.13(c)(1)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provided that the Secretary may provisionally certify an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution if the financial responsibility and administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of the institution was being determined for the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time has been deleted from these regulations. Although this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is statutory, the Secretary has decided that the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards requiring the use of provisional certification are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to identify institutions that would be captured by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision where greater monitoring and procedural restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.13(c)(2)(i) has been amended to clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum permissible length of periods of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. Upon further consideration, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to repeat the language of the statute that provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of participation under provisional certification should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be for ``complete award years.'' So, for example, the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will permit the Secretary to provisionally certify an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant for one complete award year, rather than for a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 12 months as proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will provide the Secretary with a complete award year of data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to base determinations of further participation for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.13(d)(1) that lists the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for provisional certification to participate on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited basis for institutions that are not financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible has been amended to make clear that the criteria of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section are not required for an institution that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;668.15(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment &sect;668.13(d)(1)(ii) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to clarify that any required submission of a letter of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit must be in an amount and in a form acceptable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.13(d)(1)(iii)(B) has been revised, consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with similar changes in &sect;668.15(b) (3) and (4), to make clear how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution demonstrates that it has met all of its financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations and is current in its debt payments. This provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is explained in greater detail in the section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that addresses the factors of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility (&sect;668.15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.13(d)(2) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarified to explain that financial guarantees are only required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the institution comes within the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15(c)(2), or where the institution fails to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility under its current audit and has failed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to do so at least one other time under the standards in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the preceding five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, a new paragraph (e) is added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to &sect;668.13 which provides for denial of certification to initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants for participation in a Title IV, HEA program and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants that have undergone a change of ownership resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a change of control, if the State in which those applicants or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants are located does not participate in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postsecondary Review Program. This addition conforms these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program in 34 CFR part 667, and provides some further explanation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the consequences to an institution if the State in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is located does not participate in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postsecondary Review Program. Under paragraph (e), the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may provisionally certify a participating institution or branch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus in that State. Section 668.13(c)(2)(ii) has also been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised to provide that the provisional certification of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution under these circumstances expires at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third complete award year following the date of the provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, a change has been made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for notices of revocation of provisional certification to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be sent by certified mail, instead of registered mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.13(f)(4)(i) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified to provide that the official reviewing a request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration of provisional certification must be different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from, and not subject to supervision by, the official that issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice of revocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.14(b)(1) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to clarify that an institution must comply with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. Corresponding changes have been made throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of 34 CFR part 668 and 34 CFR part 682 contained in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.14(b)(4) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to provide that an institution must provide information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating the administrative capability and financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of the information to a SPRE only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution was referred by the Secretary under 34 CFR 667.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations prohibited any type of incentive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, particularly those based on ``retention.'' In response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to public comment, the Secretary has amended &sect;668.14(b)(22) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow that token gifts may be given to students or alumni for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring other students for admission to the institution, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gift is not money, check or money order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No more than one such gift is given to any student or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alumnus; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of the gift is no more than twenty-five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, proposed &sect;668.16(k) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that an institution: (1) Demonstrate a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the length of the program and occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry level requirements and (2) establish the need for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training has been moved to &sect;668.14(b)(26). Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this provision have been amended to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of the program and occupational entry level requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by any Federal agency.

Section 668.15&blank;Factors of Financial Responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 668.15(b) (1), (2), and (3) have been amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify that, in order to be financially responsible, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must be providing the services described in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official publications and statements; providing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative resources necessary to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of subpart B; and meeting all if its financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations. This is a change from the proposed regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have required an institution to demonstrate that it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
able 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to provide and meet these requirements. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes these changes more accurately reflect the intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(b)(4) further defines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirement that an institution be current in its debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. The Secretary considers an institution to be current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its long-term debt obligations if it is not in violation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing loan agreements at the end of the institution's fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. The Secretary considers an institution to not be current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in all of its debt obligations whenever the institution is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 120 days delinquent in making payments, and a legal claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been initiated against the institution or a lien has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed on its assets due to the non-payment of the obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that an institution's non-payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations is a serious concern because the possibility exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that legal actions brought by creditors may result in forfeiture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of some or all of an institution's assets. Consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that payment delinquencies place the institution at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk, the Secretary notes that such actions are also often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precede an action by creditors to force a company into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(b)(5) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to require that the amount of an institution's required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash reserve shall be one-quarter of the amount the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid in refunds during its previous year, as shown in its audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statement. By using historical information specific to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual institution, the Secretary provides for adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves for all institutions, rather than establishing an across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the board measure which would be inadequate for some and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate for others. Also, in response to the comments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations have been changed to require the cash reserve to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained as a cash deposit in a federally insured bank account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or an investment in U.S. Treasury securities, with an original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maturity of three months or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.15(b)(6)(ii) that would have provided that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is financially responsible if the institution does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to meet current operating expenses, has been removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations. This change was made based upon general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations that were presented in the public comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the need to implement consistent standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining financial responsibility for for-profit and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, and to simplify the administrative resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to determine whether institutions were in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to numerous public comments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15(b)(7)(i)(A) and (b)(8)(i)(B) have been amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that both for-profit institutions and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions must meet an acid test ratio of 1:1 to replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed ratio requirements that differed for for-profit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit institutions. The acid test ratio is defined as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sum of cash and current accounts receivable, divided by current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. The Secretary has kept the regulatory exclusions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they represent capital outflows from an institution that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain provisions for repayment. The Secretary has allowed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion of the institution's cash reserve requirement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of the acid test ratio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment concerning the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of standards for nonprofit and for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, &sect;668.15(b)(7)(i)(B) has been amended to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a for-profit institution may not have operating losses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or both years exceeding ten percent of equity capital. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's intent is to determine whether a trend of continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses exists, or if a loss occurs in any one year that it's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude is such that it does not materially impact the equity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution. The Secretary has changed the reference year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the calculation to be that of the beginning of the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in the two year period rather than the most recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(b)(7)(ii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(8)(ii), and (b)(9)(v) have been added to provide that a for- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profit institution, a nonprofit institution, or a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may demonstrate that it is financially responsible if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it submits evidence of a superior bond rating as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to having to meet the tests for financial responsibility. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary considers an institution to be financially responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the institution has currently issued an outstanding debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations that are, without insurance, guarantee, or credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhancement rated at or above the second highest level of rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.15(b)(8)(i)(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been changed from the NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to incorporate the existing requirement that a nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must have a positive unrestricted current fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance or positive unrestricted net assets. This requirement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unchanged from the former requirement in effect for more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fourteen years that a nonprofit have a positive unrestricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current fund balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.15(b)(8)(i)(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been amended to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a nonprofit institution may not have excess current fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures in either or both of two years that results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease in the current unrestricted fund or a decrease in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrestricted net assets of greater than ten percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's unrestricted current fund balance or unrestricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net assets in the beginning of the first year of the two year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. The proposed regulation would have required that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit institution not have a decrease in total net assets of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such significance that if continued would result in a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of less than 1:1. As in the requirement for for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, the Secretary's intent is to determine whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trend of continuing excess expenditures exists, or if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant excess expenditure in any one year is so great in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude that it materially affects the unrestricted current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund balance or the unrestricted net assets of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM the Secretary proposed that a public institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is financially responsible only if it has its liabilities backed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the full faith and credit of a state. In response to public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, &sect;668.15(b)(9) has been revised to add three alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a public institution may employ to demonstrate that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible: for institutions reporting under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Single Audit Act, a positive unrestricted current fund balance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a positive unrestricted current fund balance in a state's Higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education Fund, as presented in the general purpose financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements of the state; or the submission of a statement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Auditor General that the institution has sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources to meet all of its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(d)(ii) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to identify the circumstances where an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to participate fully by showing that it meets certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions to demonstrate that it has sufficient resources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure against its precipitous closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(e)(3) has been added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify that the submission of an audit performed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Single Audit Act satisfies the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a submission of an audited financial statement under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15(e)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to public comment, the Secretary has modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed administrative standards significantly. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary made some changes and clarified implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards where commenters pointed out that the Secretary could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve the same goal by requiring less detail or action by those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that have demonstrated a history of compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations governing the Title IV, HEA programs and by imposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more requirements or restrictions on institutions that either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have no track record or have a record of problems administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary removed other sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed standards because there was overlap with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities of accrediting agencies or SPREs or duplication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of other sections of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(a) clarifies that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must administer the Title IV, HEA programs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with all the statutory and regulatory provisions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any applicable special arrangement, agreement or limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(b)(1) is amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding documented success in administering Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the list of factors the Secretary may consider in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether an individual is capable. The Secretary intends to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of factors in &sect;668.16(b)(2) primarily to assess the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of staff levels at institutions that apply for initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation, change of ownership, or the addition of a location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or branch campus; institutions that make other changes that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an impact on the administrative capability of the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as ceasing to use a financial aid servicer; and institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with documented compliance violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicited comment on the regulation of appropriate staffing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels at institutions. In response to public comment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not plan to specifically regulate in this area at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this time. However, &sect;668.16 has been amended to clarify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will look at the number and distribution of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid staff when determining if an institution uses an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The Secretary believes this addition is inherent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision and should be clearly stated. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not plan to closely scrutinize the number or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of financial aid staff at an institution unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary finds other indications that the institution may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable due to understaffing or a poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of staff at the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, use of third-party servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is added to the list of factors in &sect;668.16(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of public comment, the Secretary agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the burden to an institution of having to prepare written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for or written information indicating the nature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of communication of pertinent information among all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices that have an impact on the administration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs outweighs the benefit that this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would provide to the Secretary. Therefore, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.16(b)(4)(i) has been removed from these final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also agrees that, unless compliance problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to the listed responsibilities are identified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions may satisfy the requirement in &sect;668.16(b)(4) that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution have written procedures for or written information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to the Secretary by a general written description of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities of the various offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(e)(3)(B) is amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify that a maximum time frame in which a student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete his or her educational program must be no longer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
150 percent of the published length of the educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for full-time students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section is also amended to clarify that the time frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be divided into increments 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
of equal size.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making this change, as well as the change from previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that requires increments to be the lesser of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic year or one-half of the length of the program, to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that no increment can coincide with the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some institutions have used the previous provision as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of avoiding determining satisfactory academic progress for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a student until the student completes his or her program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increments of the maximum time frame are expected to coincide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an institution's payment period, however. For example, in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program of one academic year that is structured on a quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, the increments would be expected to be the quarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(f)(3) has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified to include documentation of a student's social security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number in the information normally available to an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and for which the institution must have a system to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve discrepancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(g) has been amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clarify that an institution must only refer to the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Inspector General of the Department of Education 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
credible

In response to public comment, the following sections have been removed from these regulations: proposed &sect;668.16(i)
that provided that an institution that serves significant numbers of students with special needs must have and implement
plans for providing students with information about how to meet their needs; proposed &sect;668.16(j) that would
require institutions to have procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student complaints; proposed
&sect;668.16(l), requiring that certain information be made available to students; proposed &sect;668.16(m)
that required that an institution have advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that accurately
reflect the content and objective of the educational programs offered at the institution; proposed &sect;668.16(o)
which addressed the issue of outstanding liabilities; and proposed &sect;668.16(r), which proposed consideration
of completion, placement and pass rate standards. The specific reasons for the removal of these provisions are discussed
in the section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis of Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that addresses administrative capability (&sect;668.16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, proposed &sect;668.16(k) that requires that an institution: (1) demonstrate a reasonable
relationship between the length of the program and occupational entry level requirements and (2) establish the need
for the training has been moved to the program participation agreement section (&sect;668.14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(j) has been amended to specify that the significant problems identified
in reviews of the institution that the Secretary will take into account in determining administrative capability,
relate to the administration of Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.16(s), which would have made an annual cohort default rate of 20% in the FFEL programs and a 15%
default rate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program immutable standards of administrative capability, has been modified
in these final regulations in &sect;668.16(m) as follows. The Secretary accepted commenters' arguments that it
would be more logical to use a 25% cohort default rate for the FFEL programs over a three-year period. Further, the Secretary
has specified in this section of the regulations that if an institution cannot be determined administratively capable
solely because the institution fails to comply with this section, the Secretary will provisionally certify the institution
in accordance with &sect;668.13(c). An institution will have the right to appeal noncompliance with this provision
by submitting an appeal in accordance with &sect;668.17(d). The Secretary has amended &sect;668.17(c)(6) to specify
that this standard will not apply to tribally controlled colleges, HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, the Secretary has amended &sect;668.16(l) to provide for the use of net enrollment
figures, after deduction of students who were entitled to a 100 percent refund, in the calculation of withdrawal rate.
In addition, the Secretary has now restricted the calculation of withdrawal rates to withdrawals of undergraduate
students. The Secretary believes that the undergraduate enrollment pattern is an adequate measurement of an institution's
ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with statute, &sect;668.17(c)(6) has been amended to extend the exemption of historically black colleges
or universities (HBCUs), tribally controlled community colleges, and Navajo community colleges from the provisions
of &sect;668.17(c)(1) to July 1, 1998. Section 668.17(c)(1) addresses the loss of participation in the FFEL programs
for institution's with cohort default rates above the specified thresholds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.17(f) which addresses Federal SLS Program participation has been deleted since the Federal SLS Program
is no longer in existence.

Section 668.22&blank;Institutional Refunds and Repayments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 668.22(a)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i), (g)((2)(iv), (i)(1)(i)(B), and (i)(2)(iii) have been revised to reflect
that a student who has taken an approved leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of Title IV, HEA
program refunds and repayments. This change has been made to ensure the treatment of leaves of absence is consistent
for all Title IV, HEA programs. The Federal Pell Grant Program regulations consider a student on a leave of absence
to have withdrawn for purposes of receiving Federal Pell Grant Program funds. This was inconsistent with the FFEL
programs regulations, which allowed an institution to consider a student on a leave of absence to still be enrolled.
The FFEL programs treatment of leaves of absence remains in effect, but only for in-school deferment purposes, not
for purposes of Title IV, HEA refunds and repayments. All Title IV, HEA programs will now treat a leave of absence as
a withdrawal for refund and repayment purposes. Corresponding changes have been made by removing the language addressing
leaves of absence in proposed &sect;668.22(i)(1)(ii), (i)(2), and (i)(3)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.22(a)(2) has been amended to clarify that the institution must provide refund examples to students only
upon request, and must inform students of the availability of these examples in the written statement of its refund
policy. The language proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM was unclear and implied that the required written refund
statement must include the refund examples themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, &sect;668.22(c)(2) and (f)(2)(ii) has been amended to include allowable late disbursements
of unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and loans made under the FDSL Program when calculating a student's unpaid
charges. This language has also been changed to allow for the inclusion of late disbursements of State student financial
assistance, provided the State in question has a standard written late disbursement policy which the institution
follows in calculating unpaid charges and provided the student is eligible to receive the late disbursement in spite
of having withdrawn. If an institution chooses to count a late disbursement of State student aid in this manner, the
institution will be liable for any amount not disbursed within 60 days after the student's withdrawal. If the late
disbursement of State aid does not come in, the institution must recalculate the Title IV, HEA program refund and return
any additional amounts required to the appropriate Title IV, HEA program accounts or to the lender within the applicable
regulatory deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 28, 1994 NPRM proposed that certain fees could be subtracted from the refund due under a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation. This treatment was consistent with previous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
guidance given under the FFEL programs. The February 28, 1994 NPRM pointed out that, as proposed, the calculation
included the fees in the institutional costs, allowed the institution to retain a prorated portion of those institutional
costs, and then allowed the full amount of those fees to be subtracted from the resulting refund. The resulting ``double-counting''
allowed the institution to retain more than the actual fees that were charged. In response to commenters that supported
the elimination of such double-counting, &sect;668.22(c)(4) has been revised to allow an institution to exclude
certain fees from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation so that the most an institution would be allowed to retain is 100 percent of an institutional charge.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, in response to comment, the reference to an application fee as an excludable fee has been deleted as it is not
necessary to specifically allow for such an exclusion. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that asserted that
an application fee should not be a factor in the calculation of an institutional refund for Title IV, HEA program purposes,
because it is not an educational cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision allowing for the exclusion of expended board credits in excess of the attributable prorated portion
(proposed &sect;668.22(c)(1)(iv)), based on the period attended by the student prior to withdrawal, has been removed.
After further examination, the Secretary has found this provision to be excessively complicated and not entirely
effective in the purpose intended. No support for this provision was received from commenters and the Secretary plans
to revisit this issue in the future, after seeking further input from the financial aid community. Except for treatment
under the provision in &sect;668.22(c)(6)(i), all room and board charges must be included in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation and refunded at the applicable percentage, as required by the Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of &sect;668.22(c)(5) (and corresponding language in Appendix A) has been changed to clarify the specific
requirements related to ``other charges assessed the student by the institution'' under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation. ``Other charges'' includes, but is not limited to, charges for any equipment, books, or supplies
issued by an institution to the student, provided that the enrollment agreement signed by the student specifies a
separate charge for such equipment or provided that the institution refers the student to an affiliated vendor for
purchase of the equipment. An institution may exclude the documented cost of such equipment from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation in the following instances: For unreturnable equipment, if the student actually receives and
keeps the equipment; or for returnable equipment, the student does not return the equipment in good condition allowing
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days after withdrawal. For example, an item is not considered to be in good condition
and, hence, is unreturnable, if it cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and sanitary reasons. Institutions
must clearly disclose in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including identifying
equipment that is unreturnable. The regulatory language has been changed to reflect that an institution must notify
the student in writing, prior to enrollment, that return of such equipment will be required within 20 days of withdrawal.
It is the responsibility of the institution to determine whether specific equipment is returnable or not, in accordance
with State and accrediting agency guidelines. This change conforms with a similar provision from the FFEL programs
regulations. The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable to expect a student to return equipment within
a certain time period without ensuring that the student has been informed of the conditions of acceptable return of
equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 28, 1994 NPRM proposed that institutions be exempted from making refunds of $25 or less, because the burden
and cost of making such a refund would exceed the amount refunded. However, that proposed change will not be made. Section
668.22(f)(3)(iii) has been amended to remove the proposed minimum dollar amount below which a refund would not have
to be made. After further consideration, the Secretary believes that this proposed provision is inconsistent with
the amendment made to section 490 of the HEA that established criminal penalties for failure to pay refunds, specifically
including refunds of less than two hundred dollars. Further, the Secretary believes that by the time the institution
has determined the amount of the refund, most of the administrative effort and cost has been expended. The Secretary
believes that neither the institution nor the student would benefit from the proposal to allow institutions to forego
making refunds of $25 or less. Also, the Secretary believes that part of the institution's administrative costs are
recouped through the administrative fee that is allowed to be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, language has been added to &sect;668.22(i)(1)(ii) to limit an institution's determination
of a student's unofficial withdrawal to no later than 30 days after the expiration of the enrollment period, the academic
year, or the program, whichever is earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.22(i)(2) has been amended to clarify that the refund deadline in that paragraph is applicable only to
refunds made to students, and does not alter or affect the FFEL regulatory deadlines for returning a refund to a lender
or the regulatory deadline for returning a refund to a Title IV, HEA program account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, the Secretary has provided the following examples to aid in the implementation of the
refund requirements:

Term Community College (TCC) offers two- and four-year programs, measured in credit hours, and its academic year
is divided into two semesters, each 15 weeks long. TCC participates in the Federal Pell Grant program, the Federal
Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs, and the Federal campus-based programs. TCC charges by the semester: $1800
for tuition, $2500 for on-campus housing and meals, $25 for application, and $75 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional
charges include: books and supply costs (because these items are purchased separately by the student, from the campus
bookstore or an unaffiliated vendor), living expenses and meals (if the student lives in off-campus housing), transportation,
and personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student budget, depending in part upon the
educational program in which the student enrolls.)

Applicable Refund Policies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The State in which TCC is located has a modified pro rata refund policy: students who withdraw on or before the 25 percent
point of the enrollment period receive a 75 percent refund; students who withdraw after the 25 percent point but on
or before the 50 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 50 percent refund; and students who withdraw after
the 50 percent point but on or before the 75 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 25 percent refund. (Students
withdrawing after the 75 percent point of the enrollment period receive no refund under State guidelines.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCC's accrediting agency refund guidelines offer a 50 percent refund to students who withdraw in the first four weeks
of the enrollment period, and a 25 percent refund to those who withdraw after four weeks but before the beginning of
the ninth week. (Students withdrawing after that point receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.)

Student Profile. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sam the Student enrolled in a two-year program at TCC, moved into on-campus housing, and began attending classes.
Sam made a cash payment of $500 toward institutional charges.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Financial Aid Package and Disbursements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sam's financial aid package for the academic year consisted of a $2200 Federal Pell Grant, a $2400 Federal Stafford
Loan, a $1600 FSEOG, and $1000 in Federal Work-Study funds. Sam's first disbursement of Federal Pell Grant funds ($1100),
his first disbursement of Federal Stafford Loan funds ($1116_loan and origination fees have been subtracted), and
his first disbursement of FSEOG funds ($800), were credited to his institutional account. Sam received $400 of his
Federal Work-Study award, paid directly to him for living expenses, before he officially withdrew at the end of the
fifth week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Only institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. TCC must use the institutional costs as charged,
by the term, for a total of $4375_$1800 tuition, $2500 on-campus housing and meals (because Sam lives on-campus),
and $75 for administrative costs. (The $25 application fee is not a cost of education, so it is not included.) Noninstitutional
costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
TCC's records show that Sam paid $500 in cash toward his institutional costs, and that a total of $3016 in student aid
was paid toward institutional charges [$1100 Federal Pell+$1116 Federal Stafford+800 FSEOG=$3016]. (The Federal
Work-Study funds are not reflected in this total, because funds earned through work-study cannot be required to be
refunded or returned, and are therefore not included in the calculation of a refund.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and financial aid) is $3516 [$500+$3016=$3516]. Only funds
paid to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation; aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional
expenses is treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the Law. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether Sam is eligible for a statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation, TCC must determine if he's a first-time student and if he withdrew on or before the 60 percent point
in time of the enrollment period for which he was charged. Sam is a first-time student, because he's never attended
classes at TCC prior to this term. He withdrew at the end of the fifth week in the term; the term is 15 weeks long, and the
60 percent point is figured in calendar time for term institutions [15 weeks&times;.60=
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9, so any withdrawal prior to the end of the ninth week falls within the 60 percent requirement of statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
]. Sam withdrew at the end of the fifth week, so he is entitled to a statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Because a student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, TCC must first calculate Sam's unpaid charges
(as defined in &sect;668.22(c) and (f)) using the following formula:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
To calculate Sam's unpaid charges, TCC subtracts the $3016 in total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two,
above) from the Total institutional costs of $4375 (from Step One, above). The resulting scheduled cash payment is
$1359 [$4375^$3016=$1359]. From that total, TCC subtracts Sam's cash payment of $500 (from Step Two, above) and Sam's
unpaid charges equal $859 [$1359^$500=$859]. This amount ($859) will be used in all three refund calculations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Five: Calculating a Fair and Equitable Refund. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Amendments of 1992, TCC must calculate Sam's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, and
under statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements. TCC must then use whichever calculation provides the largest refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the June 8, 1993 Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, for all refunds other than
statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
refunds, the student's unpaid charges must be subtracted from the amount the institution may otherwise retain. Therefore,
in calculating Sam's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, $859 (from Step Four, above) must be subtracted
from the amount TCC could otherwise retain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State refund guidelines allow Sam a 50 percent refund (he withdrew after the 25 percent point but before the 50 percent
point), which means TCC is allowed to retain 50 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs (from
Step One, above) are $4375. Assessed at 50 percent, this allows TCC to retain $2188 [$4375&times;.50=$2187.5]. (Figures
are rounded to the nearest dollar.) However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, TCC must subtract Sam's
unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, TCC is actually allowed to retain $1329
[$2188^$859=$1329]. Sam's refund under the State policy is $2187, figured by subtracting the amount TCC can retain
from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$3516^$1329=$2187]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accrediting agency refund guidelines allow Sam a 25 percent refund (he withdrew after four weeks but before the
beginning of the ninth week), which means TCC is allowed to retain 75 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional
costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. Assessed at 75 percent, this allows TCC to retain $3281 [$4375&times;.75=
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3281.25]. (Figures are rounded to the nearest dollar.) However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations,
TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, TCC is actually
allowed to retain $2422 [$3281^$859=$2422]. Sam's refund under the accrediting agency policy is $1094, figured
by subtracting the amount TCC can retain from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$3516^$2422=$1094].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To figure Sam's refund under the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation, TCC must first calculate the portion of the enrollment period that remains (in accordance with
&sect;668.22(c)) by using the following formula for credit-hour programs:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
Sam withdrew at the end of the fifth week of a fifteen-week semester, so 10 weeks remain in the term. TCC calculates that
for Sam, 60 percent of the enrollment period remains [10+15=.666, rounded down to the nearest tenth]. The statutory

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculation allows Sam a refund proportionate to the portion of the enrollment period that remains: 60 percent. Total
institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. However, under the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation, TCC is allowed to exclude from this amount an administrative charge, not to exceed the lesser
of $100 or 5 percent of the institutional charges (provided that the fee is a real and documented charge). Therefore,
the $75 administrative fee charged to all TCC students can be excluded, making the total institutional costs for statutory

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 purposes equal $4300 [$4375^$75=$4300]. (Had the administrative fee exceeded $100 or 5 percent of TCC's total institutional
charges, TCC could only have excluded the allowable portion of the fee.) Total institutional costs are assessed at
60 percent, making Sam's initial refund equal $2580 [$4300&times;.60=$2580]. However, in accordance with the law,
TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from his initial refund amount. Therefore,
Sam's actual refund under the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is $1721 [$2580^$859=$1721].

After calculating all of Sam's possible refunds, TCC must

use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this case, the largest refund is provided by the State refund

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nonterm Technical Institute (NTI) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers 900-hour and 1200-hour programs, measured in clock hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and its academic year is 30 weeks long. NTI participates in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Pell Grant program and the Federal Family Education Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FFEL) programs. NTI charges by the program and requires payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up-front. The institutional costs of the 900-hour program are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3000 for tuition; $520 for equipment, books, and supplies; and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 administrative fee. Institutional costs for the 1200-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program are: $4000 for tuition; $740 for equipment, books, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies; and a $150 administrative fee. Noninstitutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges include: living expenses and meals (NTI has no on-campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing or food service), transportation, and personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student

Applicable Refund Policies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State in which NTI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located provides a 90 percent refund to students who withdraw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before completing 10 percent of the program; students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraw after the 10 percent point but before completing 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the program receive a 70 percent refund; students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraw after the 25 percent point but before completing 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the program receive a 45 percent refund; and students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who withdraw after the 50 percent point but before completing 75 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the program receive a 20 percent refund. (Students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawing after completing 75 percent of the program receive no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund under State guidelines.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTI's accrediting agency gives an 80 percent refund to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who withdraw before completing 15 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program; students who withdraw after the 15 percent point but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before completing 45 percent of the program receive a 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund; and students who withdraw after the 45 percent point but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before completing 60 percent of the program receive a 25 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund. (Students withdrawing after completing 60 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.)

 Susan the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled in a 900-hour program at NTI and began 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending classes. Susan made a cash payment of $800 toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional charges.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Financial Aid Package and Disbursements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Susan's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid package for the program consisted of a $2000 Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant and a $2325 Federal Stafford Loan. Susan's first Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pell Grant disbursement ($1000) and the first disbursement of her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford Loan ($1081_loan and origination fees have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtracted) were credited to her institutional account. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the academic year, NTI determined that Susan had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unofficially withdrawn. The last record of Susan's attendance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was a midterm exam she'd taken after completing 450 hours of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. NTI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must use the institutional costs as charged, by the term, for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total of $3620_$3000 tuition, $520 for equipment, books, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies, and $100 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTI's records show that Susan paid $800 in cash toward her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs, and that a total of $2081 in student aid was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid toward institutional charges [$1000 Federal Pell+$1081 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford=$2081]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial aid) is $2881 [$800+$2081=$2881]. Only funds paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional expenses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 To determine whether Susan is eligible for a statutory pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata refund calculation, NTI must determine if she's a first-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student and if she withdrew on or before the point in time when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she had completed 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which she was charged. Susan enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last year in the same program at NTI, but she never began 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending classes and so was entitled to a 100 percent refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with the regulatory definition in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.22(c), Susan is a first-time student. Susan's last recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of attendance was at the point of having completed 450 clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours; 900 clock hours are scheduled for the program, and 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the scheduled hours would be 540 clock hours [900 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours&times;.60=540]. Because Susan is a first-time student and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she withdrew before completing 60 percent of the hours scheduled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she is entitled to a statutory pro rata refund calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, NTI must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first calculate Susan's unpaid charges (as defined in &sect;668.22(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (f)) using the following formula:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
To calculate Susan's unpaid charges, NTI subtracts the $2081 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total institutional costs of $3620 (from Step One, above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting scheduled cash payment is $1539 [$3620^$2081=$1539]. From that total, NTI subtracts Susan's cash
payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$800 (from Step Two, above) and Susan's unpaid charges equal $739 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[$1539^$800=$739]. This amount ($739) will be used in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three refund calculations.

Step Five: Calculating a Fair and Equitable Refund.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Amendments of 1992, NTI must calculate Susan's refund under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and accrediting agency guidelines, and under statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements. NTI must then use whichever calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the largest refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the June 8, 1993 Student Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions regulations, for all refunds other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds, the student's unpaid charges must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtracted from the amount the institution may otherwise retain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in calculating Susan's refund under State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency guidelines, $739 (from Step Four, above) must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subtracted from the amount NTI could otherwise retain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State refund guidelines allow Susan a 20 percent refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(she withdrew after the 50 percent point but before completing 75 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the program), which means NTI is allowed to retain 80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(from Step One, above) are $3620. Assessed at 80 percent, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows NTI to retain $2896 [$3620&times;.80=$2896]. However, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, NTI must subtract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from Step Four, above) from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount. Therefore, NTI is actually allowed to retain $2157 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[$2896^$739=$2157]. Susan's refund under the State policy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$724, figured by subtracting the amount NTI can retain from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$2881^$2157=$724]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The accrediting agency refund guidelines allow Susan a 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent refund (she withdrew after the 45 percent point but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before completing 60 percent of the program), which means NTI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to retain 75 percent of the institutional charges. Total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. Assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 75 percent, this allows NTI to retain $2715 [$3620&times;.75=$2715]. However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, NTI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually allowed to retain $1976 [$2715^$739=$1976]. Susan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund under the accrediting agency policy is $905, figured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
Susan's last recorded date of attendance was at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having completed 450 clock hours, so 450 hours remain in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. NTI calculates that for Susan, 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment period remains [450
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
900=.50]. The statutory pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculation allows Susan a refund proportionate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the enrollment period that remains: 50 percent. Total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation, NTI is allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to exclude from this amount an administrative charge, not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges (provided that the fee is a real and documented charge). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the $100 administrative fee charged to all NTI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students can be excluded, making the total institutional costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 purposes equal $3520 [$3620^$100=$3520]. (Had the administrative fee exceeded $100 or 5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of NTI's total institutional charges, NTI could only have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded the allowable portion of the fee.) NTI could also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude (from the total institutional costs) the documented cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any returnable equipment that Susan failed to return in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;668.22(c), and the documented cost of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreturnable equipment that was actually issued to Susan (and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept by Susan) in accordance with 668.22(c). Total institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs are assessed at 50 percent, making Susan's initial refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal $1760 [$3520&times;.50=$1760]. However, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the law, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step Four, above) from her initial refund amount. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Susan's actual refund under the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
 pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation is $1021 [$1760^$739=$1021]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After calculating all of Susan's possible refunds, NTI must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this case, the largest refund is provided by the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation: $1021. This refund amount must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned, in Susan's behalf, first to the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then to Susan, in accordance with the allocation priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;668.22(g); NTI cannot bill Susan for any unpaid charges, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because under the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation, those

Institutional Profile.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 United States Academy (USA) offers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one- and two-year programs on a semester system; its academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year is 30 weeks long and divided into two equal semesters, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 weeks in length. USA participates in the Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USA charges $800 tuition per semester. Noninstitutional costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are assessed by the semester at the following average rates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3000 for living expenses and meals (USA has no on-campus housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or food service), $250 for books and supplies (not purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the institution), $600 for transportation, and $300 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments are amended as necessary based on individual student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs and circumstances.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Institutional Repayment Policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In keeping with the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bookstore's refund policy, 50 percent of the books and supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance is incurred at the time of purchase. All other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noninstitutional (living) expenses are prorated based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the semester completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Student Profile.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sarah the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled for the winter semester at USA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
began attending classes. She made a $400 cash payment toward her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition costs. Her noninstitutional costs are adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in the institution's average student budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Financial Aid Package and Disbursements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sarah's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid package for the program consisted of a $1800 Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant and a $2000 Federal Stafford Loan. Sarah's first Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pell Grant disbursement ($900) was applied first to her tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance ($400) and the remaining $500 was then disbursed to her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cash. The first disbursement of her Federal Stafford Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($930_loan and origination fees have been subtracted) was also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursed directly to her. Sarah officially withdrew after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending 4 weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step One: Figuring Expenses Actually Incurred.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noninstitutional costs are included in a repayment calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutional costs are treated in the refund calculation. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2.) According to USA's repayment policy, 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of Sarah's $250 books and supplies allowance was incurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of purchase [$250&times;.50=$125]. The rest of her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semester expenses, for living expenses and meals, transportation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and personal miscellaneous expenses, are prorated based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the term completed. Total noninstitutional costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal $3900 [$3000+$600+$300=$3900]. Because Sarah 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed 4 of 15 weeks, these costs should be prorated at 27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent [4
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
15=.266, rounded to the nearest tenth]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Sarah's noninstitutional costs incurred equal $1053 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[$3900&times;.27=$1053]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Two: Figuring the Total Federal Student Financial Aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SFA) Disbursed as Cash.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sarah received $500 of her Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant in cash, and all of her first Stafford Loan disbursements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$930, in cash. However, in accordance with &sect;668.22(e), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment calculation does not include any Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan amounts disbursed as cash, because those loan funds will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to be repaid by the student anyway. Therefore, a total of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$500 cash disbursed is considered for repayment purposes. (As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the refund calculation, the repayment calculation does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include any Federal Work-Study funds disbursed as cash, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment of work earnings cannot be required. Notice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students Sam and Susan, from Examples 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2 respectively, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have owed repayments because they received no cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursements other than FFELP loan funds or Federal Work-Study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Three: Calculating the Repayment Owed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To calculate Sarah's owed repayment, USA must subtract the total costs incurred ($1053, from Step One above) from
the total cash disbursed ($500, from Step Two above). In Sarah's case, this calculation results in a negative number
[$500^$1053=0], which means she owes no repayment. If her cash disbursement had exceeded her costs incurred, however,
she would have been required to repay the balance back to the Title IV, HEA program funds (the Federal Pell Grant program,
in this case), in accordance with the allocation priorities in &sect;668.22(g); if Sarah had owed unpaid charges
to USA, no portion of the repayment owed could be used to pay those charges.

Section 668.23&blank;Audits, Records, and Examinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has amended &sect;668.23 by requiring an institution or a third-party servicer with which the institution
contracts to cooperate with the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency in the conduct of audits,
investigations, or program reviews authorized by law, in addition to the other authorized entities that were stipulated
in the NPRMs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary has amended this section to require an institution to have performed, without exception,
on an annual basis, a compliance audit of an institution's administration of its Title IV, HEA programs or a third-party
servicer to have performed, without exception, on an annual basis, a compliance audit of a third-party's administration
of an aspect of an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is removing the audit exceptions proposed in the NPRMs that would have exempted certain institutions
and third-party servicers from some or all of the audit requirements of this section because upon further review,
the Secretary has determined that the proposed exemptions were inconsistent with the requirement in section 487(c)
of the HEA that annual compliance audits be provided for in these regulations. However, changes are planned for the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Student Financial Assistance Programs Audit Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to reduce administrative costs by allowing institutions meeting certain performance-based or funding criteria
to submit compliance audits under a reviewed or compiled basis rather than a full compliance audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3) is revised to specify that an institution's or third-party servicer's audit report must be submitted
to the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General within 120 days after the end of the institution's or
servicer's fiscal year. An institution or third-party servicer that submits an audit conducted in accordance with
the Single Audit Act (Chapter 75 of Title 31, United States Code) is required to submit that audit report in accordance
with the deadlines established in that act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (c)(4) is revised to include the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the list of entities that the
Secretary may require an institution or a third-party servicer to provide, upon request, the results of any audit
conducted under this section.

Section 668.82&blank;Standard of Conduct

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has revised paragraph (d)(1)(D) to clarify that a third-party servicer violates its fiduciary duty
and that of any institution with which the servicer contracts if the servicer uses or contracts in a capacity that involves
any aspect of the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs any person, agency, or organization that has been or
whose officers or employees are guilty of a crime or judicially or administratively determined to have committed
fraud or other material violation of law with respect to government funds.

Section 668.92&blank;Fines

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has revised this section to take into account additional criteria when determining the amount of a fine
against a third-party servicer. Paragraph (a)(5) is revised so that a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional
error is not counted as a single violation if the third-party servicer, against whom the fine is assessed, had already
been cited for a similar violation and had not taken the appropriate steps to correct the problem. The Secretary will
also take into consideration in determining the amount of the fine, the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds that were
wasted as a result of the repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error. The Secretary also makes a conforming
change in &sect;682.413 to parallel the changes described in this section.

Section 682.413&blank;Remedial Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has revised the provisions of this section governing the means of collecting a liability that results
from a third-party servicer's violation of applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements in administering a lender's
or guaranty agency's FFEL programs. A third-party servicer is required to repay any outstanding liabilities because
of its violation only if the lender or guaranty agency has not paid the full amount of the liability or has not made satisfactory
arrangements to pay the amount of the liability within 30 days from the date that the lender or guaranty agency receives
the notice from the Secretary of the liability. If the 30-day period elapses and the lender or guaranty agency has not
paid the full amount of the liability within that time frame or has not set up a payment plan acceptable to the Secretary
to repay that liability, the Secretary will attempt to collect any remaining amount owed by offsetting the lender's
or guaranty agency's first bill to the Secretary for interest benefits or special allowance. After that, if the liability
has not been completely paid, the Secretary will seek payment for the remainder of the liability from the third-party
servicer.

Analysis of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRMs, 84 parties submitted comments on the NPRM published on February
17, 1994 and 421 parties submitted comments on the NPRM published on February 28, 1994. An analysis of the comments
and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRMs follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor changes and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority are not addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General comments that refer to broad issues rather than a specific section or sections of the proposed regulations
are discussed first, followed by a discussion of other issues in the order in which they appeared in the NPRMs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that not all comments are addressed in these final regulations. There are several reasons for this.
First, many of the concerns expressed by commenters were directed to the statute, not the proposed regulations. In
some instances, those comments are mentioned in the discussion that follows because of the importance of the issues
that were raised. In most instances, however, they are not mentioned because the Secretary is not legally authorized
to make the changes suggested by commenters. Second, many commenters made excellent suggestions for editorial and
technical changes, as well as other minor changes, that, in the Secretary's opinion, strengthened the regulations;
the Secretary has merely incorporated these suggestions without comment. Third, some comments appeared to be based
on misunderstandings of what was actually in the NPRMs. For example, a few commenters expressed concern about the
absence of a particular provision that was, in fact, included in the NPRMs. In general, these types of comments are
not discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters
opposed to the proposed regulations believed that the February 28, 1994 NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance
of responsibilities among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative
data collection and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the higher education
community. Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported
to do. In general, these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations
to determine if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and
are included in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they
believed, would ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The more specific concerns of commenters opposed to the proposed regulations may be summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed regulations are overly prescriptive and excessive in detail and either exceed the statutory authority
of the Secretary or significantly expand the statute beyond Congressional intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed regulations will force institutions and third-party servicers to engage in excessive and duplicative
information gathering and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information
available to the public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' and third-party servicers' already scarce
resources away from their primary mission of providing a quality education.

(3) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly
on vocational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to receiving comments in opposition to the proposed regulations, the Secretary received comments supportive
of the NPRM. For example, these commenters favored the increased protections for students in the changes to the refund
provisions, and approved of the strengthening of the administrative capability and financial responsibility standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage
all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect
the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common
methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations
in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations
on institutions and third-party servicers, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping
and reporting requirements. Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations,
not just to institutions and third-party servicers but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern
of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the
manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility
to determine the appropriate means to carry out those responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Secretary has responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating much of what was perceived as
excessive detail in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, thus providing institutions more flexibility to meet a particular
requirement in the manner that best suits their needs. The final regulations make it quite clear that the Secretary
continues to bear the primary responsibility for enforcing standards and requirements to ensure that institutions
and third-party servicers administer Title IV, HEA program funds properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not believe that the Department's role overshadows those of the accrediting agencies or the States.
These regulations not only speak to the responsibilities of each member of the triad, but also establish the Federal
requirements for institutions and third-party servicers under the HEA. Therefore, the Federal role in these regulations
may appear larger than that envisioned for the States and accrediting bodies, but this appearance is due to the inclusion
of the implementing regulations for these responsibilities. Without question, the States and accrediting bodies
will exercise their responsibilities by promulgating and implementing standards for HEA program participants,
and the Secretary anticipates that any overview of all such requirements by the triad would show that the Federal role
has been appropriately established. The Secretary notes that some of the commenters specific concerns are addressed
in the

 section of these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with regard to the issue of whether the regulations properly focus on vocational institutions, the Secretary
wishes to note that Congress found abuses in all sectors of higher education, not just the vocational sector. For this
reason, the regulations apply to all institutions.

Academic Year. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters argued that the proposed definition of a week in determining the length of an academic year should
not be based on the number of days of instructional time for institutions that use clock hours to measure program length.
These commenters suggested that a week of instructional time should be based on the number of clock hours completed
by a student. Some of these commenters suggested that a week of instructional time should be defined as 24 clock hours;
another commenter suggested 30 clock hours. A number of these commenters suggested that this approach was more consistent
with the regulatory requirements for calculating pro-rata refunds, which relies on the number of clock hours completed
by students.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 481(d)(1) of the HEA requires that an academic year must be a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time in which
a full-time student is expected to complete at least 900 clock hours at an institution that measures program length
in clock hours. Thus, the statute requires a minimum of 30 weeks and a minimum of 900 clock hours; both standards must
be met.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that the Secretary implement the provision in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that
provides that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks of instructional
time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of these commenters suggested that ``good cause'' should be based on educational outcomes, such as placement
rates or completion rates. Some commenters suggested the same standard that was proposed for short-term programs
in &sect;668.8_a 70 percent completion rate and a 70 percent placement rate. Other commenters suggested that approval
by an institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency or State postsecondary review entity (SPRE) would
demonstrate good cause. Some commenters suggested that good cause should be based on whether an educational program
has historically provided instruction for less than 30 weeks in previous academic years. Other factors suggested
for defining good cause included fiscal stability of an institution, scheduling adjustments due to natural disasters,
ethnic composition of an institution's student population, an accelerated or concentrated educational program,
and educational programs that offer advanced placement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that no reductions in the 30-week minimum should be permitted or that reductions should
be approved on an extremely limited basis in order to avoid inequitable treatment of institutions and students.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary did not propose specific criteria to implement this technical amendment in the February 28, 1994 NPRM,
but instead requested comments on a definition of ``good cause'' and requested comments on ways of implementing this
provision that addressed the Secretary's concern that reductions in the award year would encourage many institutions
to seek that treatment routinely. After reviewing public comments on defining good cause, and developing safeguards
to discourage routine requests for reductions in the academic year, the Secretary has implemented this technical
amendment through regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to discourage routine requests, the Secretary will grant a reduction for institutions that can demonstrate
a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, but will not permit the period of reduction to exceed two years.
For institutions that do not demonstrate a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary may grant
a reduction for a limited period, on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that suggested approval by an institution's nationally recognized accrediting
agency or State body that authorizes the institution to provide postsecondary programs should be considered as factors
in determining good cause on a case-by-case basis, but such approval may not be a sufficient reason for granting an
institution's request. Other factors that should be taken into account include the number of hours of attendance
and other coursework that a full-time student is required to complete in the academic year, and any unique circumstances
that justify granting the institution's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not believe that placement rates, completion rates or other educational outcomes that may measure
the quality of an educational program are relevant in determining whether the instruction offered in less than thirty
weeks is sufficient to justify a reduction in the minimum standard. Other factors suggested by commenters may qualify
as unique circumstances that justify granting the institution's request, depending upon the context in which these
factors are presented in a particular case.

Every institution that requests a reduction must also demonstrate that it has provided Title IV, HEA program funds
to its students based on the academic-year requirements in section 481(d) of the HEA since July 23, 1992, as the requirements
became applicable to the various Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes institutions must have made a good
faith effort to comply with the requirements of the statute. Institutions that did not comply with the law should not
now expect to receive a temporary waiver.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new &sect;668.3 is established, under which, for the purpose of awarding Title IV, HEA funds, the Secretary may reduce
the length of an academic year for an institution that submits a written request to the Secretary. The request must
identify each educational program for which a reduced academic year is requested and specify the requested length,
which may not be less than 26 weeks of instructional time. The Secretary considers requests for reducing an academic
year only for educational programs at institutions that provide 2-year and 4-year programs leading to associate
degrees or baccalaureate degrees, respectively. In addition, an institution must demonstrate that it has provided
Title IV, HEA program funds to its students based on the academic-year requirements in section 481(d) of the HEA since
July 23, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for an institution that currently has an academic year of less than 30 weeks and demonstrates that it is
in the process of changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary will grant a reduction for a period not to exceed
two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For an institution that meets all of the above requirements other than demonstrating a commitment to changing to a
30-week academic year, the Secretary may grant a reduction for a limited period, on a case-by-case basis, The Secretary
considers such factors as approval of the academic year for each educational program by the institution's accrediting
agency or State body that legally authorizes the institution to provide postsecondary education, the number of hours
of attendance and other coursework that a full-time student is required to complete in the academic year, and any unique
circumstances that justify granting the institution's request.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters supported the proposed definition of a week as a seven-day period of instructional time in which one
day of regularly scheduled instruction, examination, or preparation for examination occurs. Some commenters argued
that the standard of one day a week was too lax and susceptible to abuse. One commenter suggested that the minimum standard
for one week of instructional time should be revised to require one instructional hour per week. Another commenter
suggested that the definition of an academic year should be based on the total number of days of scheduled instruction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with those commenters who were concerned that the proposed definition of a week of instructional
time was susceptible to abuse. Based on these comments and on information the Secretary has received regarding abuses
in this area, the Secretary believes that the standard of one regularly scheduled instructional day per week needs
to be increased to five days of regularly scheduled time per week for educational programs using credit hours and not
using a semester, trimester, or quarter system. Under the proposed definition published in the February 28, 1994
NPRM, institutions could structure programs that do not use clock hours or standard academic terms to provide one
class a week and permit those classes to be ``made up'' later in the program, in order to maximize the amount of Title
IV, HEA program funds received by the institution.

A change has been made. For an educational program using credit hours but not using a semester, trimester, or quarter

A number of commenters suggested that instructional time should include internships. Some commenters suggested
including other activities, such as periods of orientation, cooperative education, independent study, special
studies, and research.

The Secretary agrees that internships, cooperative education programs, independent study, and other forms of regularly
scheduled instruction can be considered as part of an institution's academic year. In most cases, research is not
considered to be regularly scheduled instruction. Orientation programs do not provide educational instruction
related to class preparation or examination and must not be included in determining the length of an academic year.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the proposed academic year definition would make it difficult for institutions to
develop creative programs that allow students to accelerate their educational programs. One commenter believed
that, if the Secretary does not account for these types of programs, a student will no longer have an incentive to accelerate
his or her educational program, and the Department will expend more Title IV, HEA program funds on longer periods of
study.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the cost of a student's education includes living expenses in addition to the cost of tuition and fees, the
Secretary believes that students who have an incentive to reduce their costs by accelerating their educational programs
will still have a strong incentive to pursue a more concentrated or intensive course load. In addition, the Secretary
will consider unique circumstance in determining whether to reduce the academic year for programs that are eligible
for such consideration.

A commenter suggested that the Secretary define two-thirds of an academic year as a minimum of 15 weeks of instructional
time and one-third of an academic year as 10 weeks of instructional time in order to clarify the procedure for prorating
the awards for students attending programs that are less than an academic year.

The Secretary agrees that the procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prorating the awards for students attending programs that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than an academic year needs to be clarified. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not believe that 15 weeks of instructional time is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequate minimum standard for two-thirds of an academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the minimum standard for a full academic year is 30 weeks, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard for two-thirds of an academic year should be

two-thirds of 30 weeks (20 weeks).

A change has been made. In &sect;668.2, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines two-thirds of an academic year as a period that is at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least two-thirds of an academic year as determined by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. At a minimum, two-thirds of an academic year must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a period that begins on the first day of classes and ends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the last day of classes or examinations and is a minimum of 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks of instructional time during which, for an undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of study, a full-time student is expected to complete at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 16 semester or trimester hours or 24 quarter hours in an

educational program whose length is measured in credit hours or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 clock hours in an educational program whose length is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in clock hours. For an institution whose academic year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been reduced under &sect;668.3, one-third of an academic year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pro-rated equivalent, as measured in weeks and credit or

clock hours, of at least two-thirds of the institution's academic

year.

In &sect;668.2, the Secretary also defines one-third of an

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for educational programs that are measured in credit hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the Secretary establish a weekly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum full-time workload for full-time students in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs by tying quarter hours to actual quarters to prevent an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution from claiming to offer a full academic year's worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of work over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also suggested that the Secretary eliminate the use of quarter or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semester hours for institutions that do not have quarters or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semesters and instead require those institutions to measure their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs in clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters urged the Secretary to reject any mechanism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the institution would be responsible for self-measuring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of work required because it would be too easy for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unscrupulous institutions to evade. Instead, the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that only bona fide courses, related work, research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or special studies would count toward whether a student would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time, and that each institution's quantification would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be approved during the certification process set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13. One commenter also suggested that the Secretary change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures and not permit institutions to measure workloads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for term or semester based schools in clock hours, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hour schedules permitted institutions to compress the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course offerings into too short a time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters advised that the clock hour/credit hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation would provide the protection necessary for the weekly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedules of students enrolled at institutions offering credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours without terms, and recommended that no further action be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken in changing the proposed definition of full-time student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters stated that they believed the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition was sufficient to prevent abuse without further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additions to establish a minimum full-time course workload. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that no stricter definition be adopted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time students enrolled at institutions offering credit hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without terms because this area is currently addressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies, which are in a better position to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the variety of delivery systems used by postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. One commenter also questioned whether it was fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adopt a more stringent criterion for credit hour programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without academic terms rather than adopting uniform criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for full-time students for all sectors of postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed definition was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfair because it requires the same number of credit hours for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student regardless of whether the courses are measured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semester hours or quarter hours, resulting in students having to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform a greater quantity of work during a quarter calendar if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they were taking semester hours. Several other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the proposed definition was unfair because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would prohibit students from taking cooperative employment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods that were less than eighteen weeks. These commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that shorter periods of cooperative education should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted in conjunction with a smaller number of credits so long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the workload was pro-rated to match the academic workload of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student. For example, a student taking cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education for one-fourth of the credits necessary to be a full-time student would have to complete the cooperative
training in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-fourth of the time allotted to a full-time student in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eighteen week program. Two other commenters stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition would establish workloads that could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily be satisfied by part-time students or students that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking evening or weekend classes. These commenters believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that students in these circumstances were often making many more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sacrifices to pursue their education than full-time day students, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that it was unfair to reduce or eliminate aid that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students currently receive because they do not carry enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits to qualify for comparable aid under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the in-class attendance should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the only component of the student workload considered for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, and that under that standard the definition for full-time student would require at least 12 hours of attendance
per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
week to correspond to the 12 credit hour workload. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few other commenters suggested that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition be clarified to show that only students taking classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``entirely'' by correspondence would not be required to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload requirements set out in the proposed definition. Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the language for credit hour workloads be amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to show that trimester hours would require the equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload for semester hours for academic terms and academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is based primarily on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longstanding definition found in the Federal Pell Grant and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus-based program regulations. The Secretary believes this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has proved to be appropriate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective and does not believe any substantive changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. The Secretary notes that this definition is now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable for purposes of all Title IV, HEA programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual Title IV, HEA program regulations will be amended at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later date to remove the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Secretary believes that additional changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate in the regulations to prevent institutions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing elongated instructional schedules that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an appropriate workload throughout that period for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student. Institutions offering credit hour programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without terms have more flexibility in shifting the workload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for their programs over an indefinite period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary believes that it is appropriate to establish some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum instructional periods that must be used for full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students attending these institutions. No corresponding changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be made where students are already required to receive a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum amount of clock hours of training per week to be full- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time students, or where the institution has fixed terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also believes it is important to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through regulations that full-time students are performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable workloads regardless of the type of institution they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are attending, and that such work should be ratably allocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the period of instruction. The Secretary notes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is an area of abuse that is not fully addressed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the ``clock hour/credit hour'' regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than changing the proposed definition of full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student to require measurement of student workloads, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification is being made to require a minimum number of days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction per week for institutions that offer credit hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs without terms. A discussion of the specific change is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the section of the Analysis of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a student who has not earned a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baccalaureate or first professional degree. The commenters noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this would prevent students who were pursuing further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate studies from receiving any Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance. The commenters noted that this was a departure from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current departmental practice that permits such a student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA loan programs.

The Secretary recognizes that there are legitimate

reasons supported by statute for separate definitions of an

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
based upon the different statutory

requirements for the various Title IV, HEA program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is not appropriate at this time to

include a general definition of an

Third-party servicer. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters asked the Secretary not to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer services or software in the examples of activities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute administration of a Title IV, HEA program, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds that this type of service encompasses activities in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad spectrum, from computer software distributors of popular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial spreadsheet programs to computer on-line Federal news 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. Several commenters stated that computer services are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simply technological means utilized in administering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs; computer servicers who actually perform administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions would be covered, therefore there is no need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately include such providers in the definition. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters argued for the inclusion of computer services or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software in the examples of a Title IV-related activity. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters argued that it was necessary to include providers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer services and software in the definition of third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer because many distributors of software certify that their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer programs_represented to satisfy Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements_comply with all applicable Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. As a result, institutions contracting with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider for the software take for granted that the software is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in compliance with all Title IV, HEA program requirements. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement occurs because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the software, the provider of that software should be held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible. Several commenters argued that those software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers could be subject to potential liabilities for Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program violations, even though the computer programs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider could be modified by the user.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with those commenters who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either objected to the inclusion of computer services or software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers in the examples of Title IV-related activities, or who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saw no need to separately include such providers. In adopting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of third-party servicer, the Secretary is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including providers of those services or software because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that this type of service is simply a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological means to assist in carrying out certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative functions that are already included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition of a third-party servicer.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters were concerned that a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer could avoid the requirements of these regulations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simply not entering into a written contract with an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to administer any aspect of that institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the regulations stipulate that the acceptance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees by the servicer from the institution for administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any aspect of the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program would constitute a contract with the institution for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the definition of third-party servicer under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer that contracts with an eligible institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be exempt from these regulations simply by not executing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written contract with that institution. A third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is defined as anyone who contracts with an institution, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not limited to only those entering a written contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. Oral contracts, payment of fees for services rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other arrangements also constitute enforceable contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes these types of contracts and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider an individual or organization employing such a method to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs to be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer and therefore subject to these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary cautions institutions and third-party servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that verbal contracts or other non-written contracts do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt institutions from documenting in writing the contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations of both parties, including the requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.25, and submitting a copy to the Secretary, if so instructed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt that the activities of Multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data Entry (MDE) Processors and the Central Processor should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the examples of what constitutes administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a Title IV, HEA program because the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by MDEs or the Central Processor is the foundation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining a student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance.

The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. The

Secretary has previously explained in the NPRM published on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17, 1994, that MDEs serve under contract with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department and are already bound by that contract and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education requirements. Therefore, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not believe it necessary to separately regulate MDE

activities as part of these regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter was of the opinion that the activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of administering or scoring ability-to-benefit tests should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the examples of what the Secretary considers to be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer activity because these activities constitute

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:

The Secretary agrees with the commenter that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities could be considered to be an aspect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of Title IV, HEA programs and therefore should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated. However, the Secretary believes that any abuses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these types of activities will be protected against in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations governing the administration of ability-to-benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. The Secretary plans to issue an NPRM on this subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shortly. Therefore, the Secretary does not believe it necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to regulate administering or scoring ability-to-benefit test

A few commenters requested that attorneys litigating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behalf of institutions to collect loan funds or interpreting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory or regulatory requirements be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of third-party servicer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary generally considers attorneys not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be covered by the definition of a third-party servicer under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations. The Secretary, in promulgating the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of third-party servicer, applied the definition to a set of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities relating to the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, and thus is not regulating distinct entities by their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity but rather the activities that individuals or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations perform in contracting with institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provision of legal advice is not one of these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is conceivable that an attorney would be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer under these regulations if the activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the attorney, performed on behalf of an institution, constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. It would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to state that attorneys are never considered third-party servicers as that would permit services to
escape oversight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simply by being provided under attorney signature or by non-attorneys working for attorneys or their law firms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters believed that the definition of ``equivalent of an associate degree'' would be difficult to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer because colleges do not have consistent standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepting two-year programs for full credit toward a bachelor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree and for qualifying a student for admission into the third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year of a bachelor's degree program. Some of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that any person who completes the equivalent number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit hours necessary to receive an associate degree should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this definition as long as the person earned those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits from an institution that was accredited by a nationally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized accrediting agency. Other commenters suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any program that leads to an occupational objective that requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing or certification and equals at least the length of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical associate degree program, should be added to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. Another commenter expressed support for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision as written in the February 28, 1994 NPRM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition is modeled after section 1201(a)(3) of the HEA, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to measure the educational backgrounds of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admitted to programs offered by a proprietary institution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that a student does not have the equivalent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an associate degree unless he or she has completed an educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program that includes two critical characteristics: the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successfully completed at least a two-year program that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student qualifies for admission into the third year of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bachelor's degree program. The alternatives suggested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters lack these characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments about the absence of consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, the Secretary notes that inconsistent standards apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to students with associate degrees as well. The two-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs completed by students with an associate degree may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully transferable to some institutions offering bachelor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree, but not to other institutions. Institutions that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs leading to a bachelor's degree also have different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for determining a transfer student's standing.

Qualitative Factors. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters argued that short-term programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(programs of less than 600 clock hours) should not be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in existence for a year before establishing eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the rate of technological change in the workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dictates rapid responses by institutions in offering educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs to meet those changes. Some of these commenters also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that factors related to quality should be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies. Another commenter suggested that initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for these programs should be based on an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
track record of success rather than the existence of the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for one year.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that a good track record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success is whether an institution can maintain a new program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one year. The Secretary agrees that the quality of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs should continue to be monitored by accrediting agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the history of abuse in these programs necessitates Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory standards as well. Institutions are not prevented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from responding rapidly to the demands of the economy by offering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new short-term programs, but institutions must be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that these new programs can meet the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement and completion rate standards before Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds are provided to students enrolled in these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obviously, this data cannot be provided unless the program has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been in existence for a period of time.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters objected to limiting the length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a program to no more than 150 percent of the minimum number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours required for training in the recognized occupation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the program prepares students, as established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State in which the program is offered, if the State has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established such a requirement. Some of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed that the requirement would create inconsistent standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because States have different requirements and that maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program lengths should be determined by accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter argued that differing State standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it difficult to train students from neighboring States if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those States have higher standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that ``course stretching'' was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent source of abuse. They cited examples of institutions' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combining short programs into one accredited course that does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically lead to licensure, purely for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the statutory 600 clock hour minimum. These commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the standard in the February 28, 1994 NPRM was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
too lenient and that the program length should not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum State standard. Some commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum licensing standards of the Federal government should also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken into account in limiting the length of a program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that exceptions should be made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standard if the education provided by a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program was better than average.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that 150 percent of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum allows enough latitude for institutions to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality programs and furnishes a sufficient safeguard against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuses of course stretching. Because States have different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing standards, the Secretary does not believe that a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for a maximum program length is appropriate. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argument made by one commenter about training students from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighboring States with higher standards only serves to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illustrate the importance of recognizing each State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Training students who will not be able to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing requirements of the States in which they intend to work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a terrible disservice to those students. The Secretary agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these regulations ought to recognize any minimum standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by various Federal agencies for applicable short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters argued that programs with a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of graduates would not provide a statistically valid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure for completion or placement rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes these rates are statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid unless fewer than thirty students complete a program in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The percentage of educational programs this size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs is so small, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of statistical validity does not need to be addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations.

Award Year. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters suggested that the period of time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the placement rate should be based on the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year or on the award year ending twelve months earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., for 1995&hyph;96, the placement rate would apply to students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who graduated in 1993&hyph;94) instead of the immediately preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year, to account fully for the 180-day period permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that a graduate has been placed and the 13-week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period required to count an employed student as placed. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to count individuals as placements under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances becomes increasingly difficult as graduation dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach the end of an award year. Some of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that this approach would be consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting procedures of many States and accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters suggested that the burden on institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be reduced significantly if the formula for calculating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement and completion rates were the same as the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Student-Right-to-Know provisions, and if the same formulas were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by accrediting agencies and State licensing agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted in the earlier discussion, one reason that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has adopted the requirement for a short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to be in existence for at least one year is to allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a track record of completion and placement rates. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of these rates were to be based on an earlier award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or calendar year than the one specified in these regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would need to require that newly established short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs remain ineligible for an even longer period so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
track record could be established. The Secretary does not wish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to discourage the creation of legitimate, high quality short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs by requiring too great a period of ineligibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those programs. The Secretary notes, of course, that once these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations have been in effect for at least a year, data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently eligible programs, based on earlier years, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that a standard rate is desirable, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent that a standard rate will provide the information the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department and other entities seek to obtain. Some rates may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to differ in order to achieve the purpose for which they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated. For example, a rate that is designed purely for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer information purposes may require different data or time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods, than a rate that must coincide with student aid program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendars or a rate that is used for long-term academic studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary cannot control the design of placement rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by State agencies or accrediting agencies, but a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard rate or rates that can be calculated from the same data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources would help to reduce the burden on institutions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary encourages States and accrediting agencies to foster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of uniform standards the Secretary could adopt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adopt the standards in these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Student-Right-to-Know regulations are currently being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drafted with the intention of developing a completion rate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be useful for all Title IV, HEA programs when the statute so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits; but the Student-Right-to-Know regulations will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a placement rate calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter noted that some institutions do not charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new students for any institutional costs during the first month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the students attended classes, because administrators at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these institutions believe that if these students withdrew before

tuition and fees were assessed, the students could be excluded

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the completion rate, an institution would subtract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the number of regular students who were enrolled in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program those students who withdrew, dropped out of, or were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expelled from the program and were entitled to and actually

received in a timely manner in accordance with the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of these regulations, a refund of 100 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee)

 Many commenters objected to the requirement that a

student must be employed for at least 13 weeks following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduation from an institution to be included in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's placement-rate calculation. These commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that this requirement is overly burdensome because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would have to track those students for long periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They believed that an institution should not be held accountable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for factors that are beyond the institution's control, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
layoffs, plant closings, illnesses, forced relocations, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motivation of students. Some commenters suggested that instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tracking students (who tend to be very mobile) for 13 weeks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of the initial hiring by an employer should suffice. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that the period of employment should be

reduced to 30 days.

 As discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that an employment requirement of 13 weeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will help stem abuses by institutions that may arrange to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students hired for short-term jobs in order to boost placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. In addition, a period of time beyond the initial hiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an employer should be used to determine that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received adequate training from the institution. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that extraneous factors affecting a student's employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are accounted for by using a placement rate that excludes up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 percent of the institution's graduates. The 13-week period is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the period of time a student must be employed to

 Students who are placed in jobs not related to their

demonstrate that the training was effective. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that graduates who are employed in occupations that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable and related to the occupation for which they have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained should be included in the numerator of the placement rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula. In these circumstances, the training provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school is likely to have been a contributing factor in obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment. However, the Department may revise this provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the future if there are numerous incidents of abuse in this area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters contended that it would be too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome for institutions to document the placement rates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students because students and employers would have little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive to provide written verification of employment. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believed the substantiation requirement would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discourage employers from hiring students from institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicited documentation. Some commenters recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution should be required to record information, such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name, address, and telephone number of the employer, the job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title, and the starting date of employment, instead of obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the documentation proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency, or the Department's reviewers, or an auditor could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then use this information to verify the placement. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggested that a written statement from the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that his or her employment was a result of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training would be sufficient verification; or that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should merely be required to document its attempt to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written verification from employers or graduates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters also were concerned about the cost of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's proposed requirement that an institution's auditor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should review the documentation of placement rates for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student in the placement-rate calculation. Some of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggested that the auditor be permitted to verify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates by selecting a random sample. Some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the Department should administer and pay for its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own placement substantiation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the preamble to the February 28, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM, the Secretary believes that requiring institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document this data and requiring an auditor to review this data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will help curb abuse by institutions that may overstate their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates to achieve and maintain eligibility for short-term programs. In order to address this concern, the
Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that documentation of employment must be made by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable source and that written statements by the student or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution are not sufficient. The failure of an employer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student to respond to requests for documentation is accounted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by using a placement rate that excludes up to 30 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's graduates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary disagrees with comments that the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of auditing each placement rate is unnecessary or prohibitively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive. The audit will be conducted as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's annual compliance review and specific guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in the Department of Education's audit guide should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drafted in a manner sufficient to detect abuse and avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary costs.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that based on auditing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature, certified public accountants cannot certify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of an institution's placement-rate calculations, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must instead follow the procedures of an attestation engagement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarification is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section has been amended to require that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution shall substantiate the calculation of its completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and placement rates by having the certified public accountant who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares its audit report required under &sect;668.23 report on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's calculations based on performing an attestation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engagement in accordance with the Standards for Attestation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engagements of the American Institute of Independent Certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Accountants (AICPA). Section 668.24 has also been amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reflect the same type of change discussed here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters argued that students who are hired by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution either before or after they receive a degree or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate from that institution, should not be excluded from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the placement rate calculation. The commenters suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions would be penalized for hiring the most qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate and that any abuse in this area could be easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected. Other commenters suggested that graduates who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed by separate businesses that are operated by, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially linked to, an institution's owner(s) should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from the placement-rate calculation. Some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that graduates who were student employees should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtracted from the number of students who have degrees or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates if they find a position with another employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon further consideration, the Secretary agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that including students who are hired by an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a negligible effect on the institution's placement rate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly if the hiring is based on a legitimate employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion to exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduates from an institution's placement-rate formula if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are hired by separate businesses that have some financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection to the institution. In many of these cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for abuse is not as great because the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests of the parties that control the separate businesses do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not necessarily coincide with the financial interests of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that student employees who are no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer employed by the institution upon graduation and who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hired by another employer after graduation, should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from the placement rate calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirement that an institution exclude from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of a placement rate students who are hired by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has been deleted from these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters believed that the placement rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation may be misinterpreted by some institutions because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed placement rate calculation requires the school to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include students in the numerator who, ``on the date of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
are employed,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or have been employed for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential by the institution.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters suggested that the phrase ``are employed'' will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be interpreted to mean that any student employed at the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation is made, regardless of whether they have met the 13-week standard, can be included in the numerator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Every student must be employed for at least 13 weeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related comparable occupation before that student can be counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as placed. The Secretary agrees to clarify this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters argued that the purpose of the testing requirement for students who completed a program in English
as a Second Language (ESL) was unclear, and that testing the proficiency of these students was an intrusion on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's internal academic affairs and a violation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education Organization Act. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended testing students before they enrolled in an ESL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to determine whether they needed to improve their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proficiency skills, as well as testing students who completed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. A commenter suggested that the ESL testing provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should also apply to vocational programs that include ESL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education within the curriculum. Another commenter expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support for the provision as written in the February 28, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of this requirement, which is based on a California law, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to curb abuses by institutions. Some institutions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received significant amounts of Federal Pell Grant funds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who have not attained an adequate proficiency in written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and spoken English to use already existing knowledge, training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and skills. Because this testing requirement is limited to ESL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs that are ancillary to an institution's academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, the Secretary does not believe it is an intrusion on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's internal academic affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestions to add a pre-test requirement or to extend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing requirement to vocational programs that include ESL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses were not adopted at this time. However, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to monitor reports of abuse in these areas to see if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation is necessary. Institutions are encouraged to test all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students before and after they enroll in ESL courses to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the students need to improve their proficiency skills and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether the students have attained the desired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proficiency skills after completing the courses.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 A few commenters opposed subjecting a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer to proceedings under subpart G of this part, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs emergency actions, fines, and limitation, suspension, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination of participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters felt that since the Secretary has noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are ultimately responsible for any liabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred that the institutions should be responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring the activities of the organization with which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that third-party servicers should not be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings under subpart G of this part. The statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requires the Secretary to apply subpart G 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings to third-party servicers. The Secretary agrees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters that institutions have a duty to monitor the actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of their third-party servicers, and that an institution is always 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately liable for any violations caused by those servicers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but, the Secretary believes that Congress clearly intended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to directly hold third-party servicers accountable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any program violations through the use of all sanctions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary is able to impose. The sanctions under subpart G 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this part are an appropriate recourse to use to correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program violations because a third-party servicer, as an agent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution, contracts with institutions to provide services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that parallel an institution's responsibilities under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's program participation agreement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section of the regulations generated many comments. Some commenters were concerned about the circumstances
under which their institutions might be required to file an application in order to continue to participate in a Title
IV, HEA program. The majority of the comments concerned the need for institutions to be notified enough in advance
of the expiration of their program participation agreements so they could file an application for reapproval and
the corresponding need for the Secretary to act on an institution's renewal application prior to the expiration of
the institution's program participation agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters were concerned that the provision requiring institutions to apply for recertification upon
the request of the Secretary allowed the Secretary too much discretionary authority and would mean that the Secretary
would act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Many of these commenters believed that the regulations should identify
the specific circumstances or significant events that would trigger a request from the Secretary and should require
the Secretary to explain the reasons for the request. Two commenters recommended further that the regulations make
clear that the Secretary will initiate action only if there is reliable evidence affecting an institution's financial
responsibility or administrative capability. This commenter also said that it should be made clear that such an application
would not be considered an initial application and that if the Secretary were to determine, on the basis of the application,
that the institution should no longer participate in a Title IV, HEA program, the institution would have recourse
to the appeal procedures specified in subpart G of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over seventy commenters were very concerned about the recertification process. Their understanding of the process
was that even were an institution to file an application for reapproval in a timely manner, if the Secretary did not
approve the institution prior to the expiration date of its program participation agreement, the institution either
would lose approval altogether or would be provisionally certified. Because provisional certification connotes
lesser status to these commenters and confers fewer appeal rights than full certification, the commenters viewed
provisional certification under these circumstances to be unfair and unacceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters provided concrete, constructive recommendations for addressing their concerns. The majority
of these commenters asked that the Secretary notify institutions in advance of the scheduled expiration dates of
the program participation agreements and supply the necessary application forms. One group of commenters suggested
that the Secretary establish time frames for the submission and the processing of applications. The time frames proposed
by the commenters varied greatly, with one commenter urging that the Secretary be required to send applications to
institutions 18 months in advance of the expiration dates of the program participation agreements and another stating
that six months would be sufficient. Other commenters would have the regulations require that the Secretary act on
an application within 45 or 60 days of receipt. The approach taken by another group of commenters was to recommend that
if an institution submitted an application for renewal within a specific time frame, such as a certain number of days
prior to the expiration date of the program participation agreement, the Secretary should extend the certification
of the institution, as necessary, until the Secretary's review is complete.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary finds it necessary to reserve the right to require a participating institution to submit an application
for certification if the Secretary has reason to believe the financial responsibility or administrative capability
of the institution is in question. The Secretary refers those concerned to a discussion of the Secretary's position
on page 9533 of the preamble to the NPRM published on February 28, 1994. The Secretary reiterates that the Secretary
expects to exercise this authority rarely and to advise the affected institution of the reason for the request. An
application submitted under these provisions is not considered an initial application, because the institution
is a participating institution. The institution continues to be governed by the program participation agreement
in effect at the time the institution submits its application until that program participation expires, the institution
signs a new program participation agreement, or the Secretary limits or terminates the institution's program participation
agreement under the procedures in subpart G of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands the concerns expressed regarding the processing of renewal applications and agrees that
an institution should not be penalized if it files an application in a timely manner but the Secretary is unable to complete
a review of the institution prior to the expiration date of the institution's program participation agreement. For

 There were a number of comments on this section, and they conveyed a wide range of concerns. Many of the commenters were
concerned that institutions would be required to notify the Secretary of each new location, regardless of the percentage
of the educational program offered at the location. Many of these commenters asserted that the provision would prohibit
community colleges from responding to community needs, because community colleges are constantly offering training
and education at new locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters could discern no reason why the addition of a branch campus or other location at which 100 percent
of an eligible program is offered should trigger a certification review of an entire institution. These commenters
suggested that because accrediting agencies and State licensing bodies review additional locations, there is no
need for the Secretary also to conduct a review. One commenter went so far as to recommend that &sect;668.12(b)(2)
be removed, to guarantee that if the Secretary were to decide to certify a branch campus or other location, the decision
could not trigger a recertification review of the entire institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were concerned about the effect of these regulations on the ability of institutions to continue to offer
internships on sites apart from their main campuses. Commenters complained about the effect of these provisions
on an institution that contracts with a company to provide training for the company's employees on the site of the company's
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters supported the Secretary's need to monitor the financial responsibility and administrative capability
of institutions that establish locations that offer at least 50 percent of an educational program. Two commenters
recommended that the regulations be expanded to require that a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational
program be reported to the Secretary if the volume of activity at the location exceeded a certain threshold.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comments reflect a good deal of confusion about the current requirements for reporting the addition of locations,
current application procedures, and the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current Institutional Eligibility regulations, published on April 5, 1988, specify in &sect;600.30(a)(3)
that institutions are to notify the Secretary of any changes in the name or number of locations since the institution's
last eligibility application. As a practical matter, the Secretary has required institutions to report only changes
to those locations at which the institution offered a complete educational program. This policy has been reflected
for several years in the application and instructions. Thus, the notification requirement in these regulations,
and the corresponding requirement in the new Institutional Eligibility regulations at &sect;600.30, are actually
less onerous than the requirements in earlier regulations. Under these final regulations, community colleges and
other institutions that frequently establish outreach locations at which they offer one or two courses need not report
these locations. And, unless the internship portion of a student's program constitutes at least 50 percent of that
program, there would be no need to report the location at which an internship is performed. Similarly, there is no need
to report locations that offer only continuing education classes and do not have students who are eligible to receive
Title IV, HEA program funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has determined through experience that the addition of a branch campus or other location that offers
a complete educational program can have a major impact on the financial status of the whole institution and the ability
of the whole institution to administer the Title IV, HEA programs. For many years, the Secretary has required institutions
that seek to add a location at which a complete educational program is offered to undergo a certification review so
that the Secretary could ascertain whether the institution has the financial resources and sufficient administrative
capability to support another location. In addition, section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to have a form
on which the institution describes the relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of its branch campuses.
It follows then that the Secretary cannot scrutinize a branch campus in a vacuum. Thus, this provision is a codification
of the Secretary's longstanding policy and application procedures and new statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters that discussed employer-sponsored training programs seemed not to understand that if institutions
contract with employers to provide training programs at the work-site or some other off-campus location that employer
is paying for the cost of training and no Title IV, HEA program funds are involved, there is no need for the institution
to notify the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has established a requirement that an institution must notify the Secretary of a location that offers
at least 50 percent of an educational program if the institution wishes to have the location included in the institution's
participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary puts institutions on notice that they may be required to file
a complete recertification application in such situations, but the Secretary expects to make requests for complete
recertification applications only rarely.

 A few commenters asserted that the proposed requirement of &sect;668.12(e)(2) for an institution to provide to the
Secretary upon request all information that the Secretary needs to certify an institution was too broad. Their perception
was that the requirement would give the Secretary unlimited access to institutional information under the guise
of a certification review. They recommended that the provision be revised to state that the Secretary would request
only the information and documentation specified on the application form.

 This provision refers only to information and documentation needed to certify that the institution meets the standards
in this subpart, particularly the factors of financial responsibility and standards of administrative capability.
The application form clearly specifies the information and documents that institutions must submit with their application.
However, the Secretary must retain the flexibility to request additional information or documentation to clarify
or support an institution's response on the application, should that be necessary. The Secretary notes that this
provision would not require an institution to provide information such as tenure information contained in faculty
records.

based upon a problem that was identified at its branch location.

 The commenters misunderstood the purpose of this provision. Section 498(j) of the HEA requires a branch campus, as
defined by the Secretary, to be certified under the requirements of this subpart to be included in an institution's
participation in a Title IV, HEA program. Thus, a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
must separately demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that it meets, for example, the factors of financial
responsibility and standards of administrative capability. The commenters should note that the Secretary has defined

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the discussion for the proposed regulations, the full four year certification period will generally be
used for institutions. There may be a limited number of times when an institution would receive a shorter period of
full certification, based upon the specific circumstances presented. One instance where a shorter period of full
certification would be used is where an institution has submitted a materially complete application for renewal
in a timely manner, but no decision is issued before the institution's certification expires. In that instance, as
explained in the discussion concerning provisional certification below, the institution's full certification
would be extended on a month to month basis until a decision on its application was issued. Other situations will arise
where a certification of less than four years will be appropriate, but it is not feasible to try and identify such infrequent
actions by referencing them specifically in the regulations.

Provisional certification. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters were concerned that the proposed implementation of provisional certification in the regulations
was very broad, and would impose hardships on a number of institutions. The commenters suggested that the Secretary
treat the administrative capability and financial responsibility requirements as indicators of instances where
provisional certification could be used, but would not necessarily be required if the institution could demonstrate
that it should be permitted to participate under full certification. Numerous commenters suggested that it was inappropriate
to use provisional certification for institutions whose cohort default rates exceeded the thresholds set out in
the proposed regulations at &sect;668.16. Other commenters recommended that the regulations be amended to clarify
that provisional certification could be renewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that the regulations be amended to provide for the provisional certification of all institutions
in a State where no SPRE has been established. These commenters believed that this use of provisional certification
was consistent with the intent of the HEA for the Secretary to monitor institutions more closely in this situation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes it is appropriate to use the administrative capability and financial responsibility thresholds
as events that will require provisional certification, rather than as indicators that might or might not result in
provisional certification being required. Provisional certification will be used to permit these institutions
to continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs while correcting over time the items that were identified
that caused the institution to be placed under provisional certification. The categories and thresholds set out
in the regulations provide sufficient notice to institutions of the standards to which they will be held accountable.
The proposed mechanism for provisional certification also provides administrative efficiency in reviewing applications
for certification, and encourages institutional improvements over time to meet and maintain these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has responded to concerns about the cohort default rate measures by adjusting the administrative capability
thresholds in &sect;668.16 that would trigger a requirement that an institution would receive provisional certification
based upon its reported cohort default rates. See the section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that addresses administrative capability (&sect;668.16). The Secretary intends that institutions that have participated
successfully under provisional certification, but who still do not satisfy certain requirements for full certification,
will be permitted to renew their provisional certification. No specific changes are needed to reflect this procedure
in the regulations, because such decisions will be made in response to the applications for certification that institutions
will submit in response to the expirations of their current certifications.

The Secretary agrees that technical changes are needed to make these regulations conform to the requirements of the
State Postsecondary Review Program in 34 CFR part 667, and has decided to provide some further explanation here of
the consequences to an institution if the State in which the institution is located does not participate in the State
Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494(a) of the HEA prohibits the Secretary from designating as eligible to participate in a Title IV, HEA program
any institution seeking initial participation in that Title IV, HEA program, or any participating institution that
has undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, as determined under 34 CFR 600.31, if the institution
is in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary also is prohibited
from designating for initial inclusion in any institution's eligibility for participation a Title IV, HEA programs
branch campus located in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program, even if the institution
itself is in a State that participates in the State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Secretary may grant no more than provisional certification for participation in a Title IV, HEA program
to any participating institution or branch campus in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary
Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, all States participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary does not anticipate
that any State will fail to comply with the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review Program to the extent that
the State will cease to participate in the program. Nevertheless, the regulations need to incorporate these statutory
provisions so that institutions may be aware of the potential consequences of a State's failure to participate in
the program.

IV, HEA program and to participants that have undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, if the
State in which those applicants or participants are located does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review
Program. Under paragraph (e), the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating institution or branch campus
in that State. Section 668.13(c)(2)(ii) has also been revised to provide that the provisional certification of an
institution under these circumstances expires at the end of the third complete award year following the date of the

: The Secretary believes that the other standards requiring the use of provisional certification are adequate to
identify institutions where greater monitoring and procedural restrictions are appropriate. The Secretary agrees
that longstanding institutions with no previous problems identified in their administrative capability or financial
condition will not require the use of provisional certification where the current audits and application submitted
by the institution satisfies the financial and administrative requirements under the regulations. Furthermore,
since provisional certification is required for initial applicants and for existing institutions whose financial
condition or administrative capability cannot be shown to meet the required standards, there does not appear to be
a corresponding need to require provisional certification if a participating institution satisfies the proposed
standards when the Department reviews its application for the first time.

: A number of commenters objected to the proposal that provisional certification be used for all occasions where the
institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change of control. Instead, the commenters suggested
that there were numerous instances where a transfer of an institution to a new owner should be viewed as a positive step
that should be encouraged by using full certification, especially where the transfer was to an owner that had already
established a good track record with the Department. Some comments also recommended that transfers to family members
or to employees that had experience operating the institution should not require provisional certification.

: The Secretary agrees that some transfers to family members or to personnel that own stock in an institution who have
also worked for the institution should be treated differently from other changes of ownership that result in a change
of control. These transfers to family members or to certain other owners have been exempted from treatment as a change
of ownership resulting in a change of control in the regulations codified at 34 CFR part 600. In all other situations
where there is a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to use
provisional certification in order to provide more protection to the Federal interests while the new owner demonstrates
the ability to operate that institution successfully. Such concern is especially warranted where a financially
troubled institution has been acquired for little or no capital investment by the new owner, because the risk of loss
is minimized if the institution fails as a business investment. Even though it may be a positive step for an institution
to be bought by a new owner who can provide greater resources and experience in its operations, it is also reasonable
to provide for the greater oversight and protection to Title IV, HEA program funds that are available under provisional
certification. Also, the period of provisional certification may be established for a shorter period where the particular
facts so warrant.

: A number of commenters were concerned that an institution that had applied for recertification in a timely manner
would be placed on provisional certification if the Department had not processed the application before the institution's
participation agreement expired. These commenters objected to changing an institution from full certification
to provisional certification where the delays were attributable to the Department's review process rather than
to a tardy application for renewal from the institution. Some remarks were also submitted by these commenters suggesting
that formal notice be required from the Secretary of the expiration date for an institution's period of participation
before any such ending date could become effective.

Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Secretary agrees that delays in processing applications by the Department should not be the cause for transferring
an institution from full certification to provisional certification. In such a circumstance where a complete application
for renewal was timely submitted, it is appropriate to provide for a mechanism that will continue the institution's
full certification on an interim basis. The Secretary has decided to establish a target date for institutions to submit
certification renewal applications at least 90 days before the ending date for the institution's current program
participation agreement. Provided that the application is materially complete when submitted, the institution's
full certification will continue beyond its expiration date on a month-to-month basis until the Department issues
its decision on the application. If the institution's application is not approved for full certification, the program
participation agreement will expire on the last business day of the month in which the decision is sent to the institution.
If the application for full certification is not made at least 90 days before the ending date for the institution's
program participation agreement, the institution will only be permitted to participate under provisional certification
while an application for recertification is pending. When an institution is notified that its application for recertification
was not materially complete when submitted, the Department will exercise reasonable discretion in determining
whether to deny the application as submitted or to request additional information, and to determine whether the institution
may continue to participate under provisional certification while the application is reviewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary continues to believe that it is appropriate for the institution to monitor the expiration date for its
participation rather than relying upon the Secretary to tell it when it must reapply. Although the Secretary may provide
routine notices to institutions concerning upcoming expiration dates, the institution will be held responsible
for submitting an application for recertification in a timely manner in accordance with the expiration date on its
program participation agreement, regardless of whether the institution receives a notice of expiration from the
Secretary.

: A number of commenters stated that an institution should not be placed under provisional certification if the institution
satisfied the criteria for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are
not financially responsible. These commenters believed sufficient protection of Title IV, HEA program funds was
obtained from the required posting of a reduced surety in conjunction with using a funding arrangement other than
the advance payment system without the additional requirement of only granting provisional certification to the
institution. Several of the commenters also argued that any institution meeting these criteria should be considered
to be financially responsible, and therefore not placed under the provisional certification that would trigger
heightened monitoring by the Department and by the other members of the triad. The commenters also observed that institutions
that were in financial difficulties would probably experience further hardship by being required to post a surety
and receive Title IV, HEA program funding through an alternate mechanism.

A few commenters noted that this provision appeared to require provisional certification if an institution did not
demonstrate financial responsibility under the general standards of financial responsibility set out in &sect;668.15(b),
and that such a construction of the regulation would mean that institutions demonstrating financial responsibility
under the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility set out in &sect;668.15(d) could still
be required to use provisional certification.

Some commenters also suggested that the reference to a letter of credit be modified to explain that it would be an irrevocable
letter of credit rather than some other type that the institution could revoke without notice to the Department. These
commenters also suggested that institutions could withhold information about the amount of Title IV, HEA program
funds disbursed through the institution that would otherwise increase the amount of the letter of credit that would
be set based upon the information available to the Department for the institution's prior award years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that the requirement that an institution show that it has met all of its financial obligations
during the preceding two award years be expanded to acknowledge that normal business practices would permit institutions
to refinance debts to change payment terms or obtain lower interest rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also stated that the proposed regulation was unfair because it would require provisional certification
for any institution that had not demonstrated financial responsibility during the preceding five years, regardless
of whether the institution currently demonstrated financial responsibility under its most recent audit. These
commenters believed that such a procedure would be unfair because it could penalize an institution that met current
financial responsibility standards based upon its prior financial condition. Other commenters suggested that
the Secretary should exercise discretion in determining when financial guarantees would be required rather than
making them mandatory whenever an institution triggered these provisions.

: The Secretary disagrees that the standards for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for
institutions that are not financially responsible should be deemed to constitute a sufficient demonstration of
financial responsibility that would warrant granting full certification to such institutions. Institutions that
are not able to meet the general standards of financial responsibility in &sect;668.15(b) or the exceptions to the
general standards of financial responsibility in &sect;668.15(d) are in a financial situation that is demonstrably
different from their counterparts that do satisfy the requirements under these sections. Institutions that only
meet the standards for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not
financially responsible warrant the additional monitoring and protection to Title IV, HEA program funds that provisional
certification provides. Even though such funding restrictions and surety postings may be difficult for some institutions
that are already experiencing financial restraints, such protections and the heightened ability to act quickly
to protect Title IV, HEA program funds are essential for improving the Department's oversight and gatekeeping responsibilities.
Provisional certification will permit some institutions to improve their financial operations over time without
compromising their administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary would like to clarify that any letter of credit that an institution is required to submit to the Secretary
must be in a form and amount acceptable to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters on the provision requiring an institution to have met all its financial obligations
during the preceding two award years. The Secretary has decided to clarify this provision in the manner in which a similar
provision has been clarified in &sect;668.15 (see the discussion in &sect;668.15 on this issue). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary would also like to clarify when third party financial guarantees or assumptions of liabilities by owners
are required. Institutions that demonstrate financial responsibility under the requirements of &sect;668.15(b)
and &sect;668.15(d) and are in compliance with all other requirements of this subpart generally are entitled to full
certification. An institution that, despite meeting the requirements of &sect;668.15(b) and (d), falls within
one of the categories in &sect;668.15(c)(2) is not considered financially responsible and therefore cannot be fully
certified. These categories include a limitation, suspension, or termination by the Secretary or a guaranty agency
of the institution's participation at any time within the previous five years or a settlement to resolve such an action.
Also included are audit or program review findings during the two most recent audits or program reviews amounting
to more than five percent of the institution's Title IV, HEA program funds for a given award year, a citation for failure
to submit acceptable audit reports in a timely fashion during any of the previous five years, and a failure to address
satisfactorily any compliance problems still identified in program reviews or audits after the institution has
exhausted its appeals of those findings. The Secretary considers any of these characteristics sufficiently detrimental
to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs to provide that an institution meeting them is not financially responsible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, to emphasize the seriousness with which the Secretary views these institutional failings, to protect Federal
funds, and to deter institutions from acting in a manner that could cause them to fall within one of these categories,
the Secretary will refuse even to provisionally certify such an institution, unless the appropriate additional
financial guarantees and assumptions of liability are furnished. In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary had
also proposed to apply this treatment regarding provisional certification to any institution failing the financial
responsibility standards of &sect;668.15 during the previous five years. The Secretary believes that a modification
of this last provision is in order. The Secretary therefore wishes to clarify that any institution that fails to demonstrate
financial responsibility under its current audit, and that has failed to do so at least once under the standards in
effect during the preceding five years (other than for a reason described in &sect;668.15(c)(2)) is also required
to post financial guarantees and furnish assumptions of liability in accordance with &sect;668.13(d)(2). This
additional safeguard is warranted where an institution does not meet the current standard for demonstrating financial
responsibility and has failed to do so at least once during the preceding five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to put in place a procedure where such financial guarantees and assumptions
of liability will be required from institutions that come within the provisions in &sect;668.13(d)(2). Rather than
exercising discretion in whether to require such guarantees at all, the Department will examine the specific circumstances
presented by each such institution and set the required amount and terms of the financial guarantees and assumptions
of liability in accordance with the regulation.

Revocation of provisional certification. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters complained that the lack of a formal appeal process for revocation of provisional certification
was unfair to the institution because it provided much less due process than is available to other institutions under
the appeal procedures in subpart G of the regulations. Some of these commenters also indicated that they believed
it would be more appropriate to offer provisionally certified institutions the full appeal rights under subpart
G of the regulations, and several commenters believed that more extensive appeal procedures were required to revoke
provisional certification than were described in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters also suggested that a revocation notice should not be made effective upon the date of the mailing,
but either upon receipt by the institution or until a specified number of days after the mailing. A few commenters also
recommended that first class mail be used because it is an accepted means of filing legal documents in the court system,
or that certified mail be used as an alternative to registered mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters also requested that the provision that provides that an institution may request reconsideration
of a revocation of provisional certification be modified to provide that any request for reconsideration of a revocation
of provisional certification be decided by someone other than the person issuing the revocation. These comments
stated that it was important that such requests for reconsideration be made to a different official because it would
be more meaningful than having the request be presented to the person that had already made a decision adverse to the
institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that revocations of provisional certification should receive the same
appeal procedures given to fully certified institutions under subpart G of the regulations. Institutions receiving
provisional certification are being given the opportunity to participate under limiting conditions because a heightened
risk to Title IV, HEA program funds has been identified, either by the institution's current financial condition
or through prior problems in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs by the institution or its owners. Furthermore,
section 498(h) of the HEA provides that provisionally certified institutions may be terminated if the Secretary
determines that an institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement.
This language is significantly different from the requirement in section 487(c)(1)(F) of the HEA that provides that
an adverse action against a fully participating institution be determined after reasonable notice and opportunity
for hearing. The regulations require that the notice revoking the provisional certification contain the basis for
the action, explain to the institution the consequences of such revocation, and detail the procedures required to
request reconsideration of the action. The notice and opportunity to request reconsideration of the decision to
revoke the institution's provisional certification provide adequate protection to the institution that it will
have the opportunity to respond directly to the stated basis for the action, and establish a reasonable mechanism
to resolve the dispute in a fair manner. The Secretary believes that such procedure provides an institution with a
fair opportunity to be heard, and the final agency decision will be subject to Federal court review to ensure that the
action was not arbitrary and capricious.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree that a notice of revocation of an institution's provisional certification should be
effective on a date other than the date that the letter is sent to the institution. An institution that participates
under provisional certification does so with the understanding that it is subject to greater scrutiny with fewer
procedural rights when problems are identified. A notice advising the institution that its provisional certification
is revoked will identify the reasons for such action and give the institution an opportunity to request reconsideration
of that decision. The effective date of the revocation is the date that the notice is mailed; this provides greater
protection of Title IV, HEA program funds while still giving the institution an opportunity to have that decision
subsequently set aside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that it would be more appropriate to provide that notices of revocation decisions will be sent
by certified mail, return receipt requested, rather than by registered mail. The Secretary notes that certified
mail is already used to initiate adverse actions against fully participating institutions under subpart G of the
regulations, and therefore believes that it is appropriate to standardize this notice requirement for revocations
of provisional certification. The regulation also provides that, where practical, more expeditious notice may
be provided through facsimile or overnight mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that the designated department official making the decision concerning an institution's request
for reconsideration of a revocation should be different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official who
initiated the revocation of the institution's provisional certification. This separation of function will ensure
that the official making the final decision for the Department is independent from the supervision of the official
issuing the initial decision, and this procedural protection strengthens the integrity of the review procedures
for revocation of provisional certification.

The Secretary would like to clarify that any ``special arrangements, agreements, or limitations'' included in an
institution's program participation agreement by the Secretary should apply only to those special arrangements,
agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. Considering
that the language for this section of the regulations is for the most part statutory, institutions have had access
to this information since July 1992 when the Amendments of 1992 were enacted. The Secretary believes that institutions
have had adequate time to set in place any policies or procedures to comply with this section. A ``phase-in'' period
is unnecessary.

 One commenter agreed that a mechanism was needed to ensure that an institution's fund requests meet only its immediate
Title IV, HEA program needs, but suggested that such a mechanism should accommodate institutions where funds must
first pass through a State agency, adding to the time frame for expenditure. Four commenters indicated that the proposed
regulations may necessitate changes in institutions' methods of accounting, programming, banking, fund monitoring,
etc. and recommended that institutions should be allowed a reasonable ``phase-in'' period for the requirements,
during which the Secretary should provide significant guidance regarding implementation.

 The Department's requirements regarding immediate cash needs have not changed with these proposed regulations.
They have simply been restated as a criterion of the program participation agreement. These long established rules
are explained in many Department publications, and are included in annual Department training sessions. A ``phase-in''
period for these requirements is unnecessary. As for institutions that must wait for funds to pass through a State
agency, these institutions should have already addressed this issue in an effort to comply with existing Title IV,
HEA program guidance.

 A large group of commenters was concerned that the information provided to the Secretary, SPRE, guaranty agency,
accrediting agency or State licensing agency relative to an institution's administrative capability and financial
responsibility may be disclosed to the public, and recommended that the Secretary provide a guarantee that such information
must be kept confidential by the above-listed parties. Three commenters suggested that the Secretary develop a specific
format for the reporting of data and that the data be sent directly to the Secretary for dissemination to any of the above
organizations that might need it.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary does not have the authority to create or supersede laws that may relate to disclosure of potentially
sensitive information. Such laws vary from State to State and from agency to agency; it would be inappropriate for
the Secretary to address such an issue. As for data provided directly to the Secretary, if that data were discloseable
under a freedom of information request, the Secretary would have no choice but to release the information if it were
requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the provision only requires institutions that have been selected for review under the
State Postsecondary Review Program process to provide the above-referenced information to SPREs. By the nature
of the selection procedures and because of the limited number of institutions which the Secretary anticipates will
meet review-triggering criteria, the Secretary believes most institutions will not be requested to provide this
information and therefore will not need to worry about potential public disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes a specific format for reporting and a centralized location for collection of data are unnecessary
at this time. As the information must only be provided upon request, each organization can specify exactly what information
is needed from an institution and in what time frame. A format specified by the Secretary might cause some institutions
to be burdened with providing information that is not needed.

 The commenters are correct. Institutions do have a responsibility to determine the amounts of Title IV, HEA program
funds students have received attending other institutions by obtaining financial aid transcripts from those schools.
Past abuses with this system, caused chiefly by institutions which did not recognize the importance of financial
aid transcripts, have created the need to tie this requirement to an institution's continuing participation in the
Title IV, HEA programs. While the Secretary does not anticipate that an institution would be penalized for information
of which it was not aware, it must be stressed that an institution must do everything in its power to ensure that no loan
is certified for an amount in excess of a student's allowable limits.

following year prior to the deadline. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution will then process the student's aid package with no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of State grant funds for that award year. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not understand how this requirement could have any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse affect on an institution. In fact, it is the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding that many institutions already publish State grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application information in their catalogs or disseminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information through their financial aid offices. Regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students from other States, institutions are indeed required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform them of State grant assistance available to them from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own State; however, the institutions are not expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experts on this information, but rather to be sources of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from which students may learn who to contact in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State to apply for assistance. The Secretary does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement is unduly burdensome on institutions.

A large group of commenters was concerned that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring newly participating institutions or institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have changed ownership to implement a default management plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to Appendix D, for two years, was overly restrictive. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that institutions be allowed to submit an alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan to the Secretary for approval. Many of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that in the case of ownership changes, institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with default rates under a certain percentage (10% or 20%) should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be exempt from the requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary's proposal that newly participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions and institutions that have changed ownership use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D as a default management plan was made only after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
careful review by the Department showed that Appendix D is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective in helping reduce student defaults. Moreover, Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D is simply a basic default management plan. There is nothing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute or regulations that would preclude an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from adding elements. In fact, the Secretary applauds such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creative efforts and believes they may help to further reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student defaults. The Secretary believes institutions with low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rates should not be exempted because there is no reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to believe under different ownership the rates would remain as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters argued that the provisions in this

section governing an institution's ability to employ or contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with individuals or organizations to administer any aspect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs or the receipt of funds under those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs go far beyond the scope of section 487(a)(16) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. These commenters pointed out that the statute referred only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to individuals or organizations that have been convicted, have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or guilty to a crime, or that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judicially determined to have committed fraud involving Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program funds and not to administrative determinations, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material violations of law, or misuse of State, local, or Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government funds (other than Title IV, HEA program funds) with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to an institution's ability to employ an individual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization. One commenter supported the Secretary's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions. Five commenters were concerned that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be penalized for hiring or contracting with a party convicted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fraud involving government funds or a party that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated from participation under the HEA for an infraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving government funds, even if they were unaware of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conviction or termination. One commenter was concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may be penalized if it hired or contracted with such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a party, even if that person's job was to cut grass or collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garbage.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that the provisions in this section restricting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's ability to employ or contract with certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals or organizations go beyond the authority of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(a)(4) expressly requires an institution to agree in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its program participation agreement to comply with financial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal responsibility requirements established by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements are part of the financial responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions found in &sect;668.15(c). In proposing the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions in the NPRM, the Secretary provided justification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these additional safeguards were necessary to protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs and institutions participating in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The Secretary still believes those justifications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be valid. The regulations state in regard to a participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's responsibility, it will not ``knowingly'' employ or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with an individual, agency, organization, etc. which has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violated any laws involving any government funds. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes the regulations are clear that an institution will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be penalized for information of which it is not aware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, in safeguarding Federal funds, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
parties that may have previously violated a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law involving government funds, even if these parties now perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
janitorial or maintenance duties. By the provision, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment or contract relationship with such a party is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, and by ``knowingly'' entering into such a relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution may well jeopardize its continued participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations make this clear as well.

Three commenters recommended that the regulations be

The purpose of this provision is to safeguard

Federal funds, not to punish institutions or servicers that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been terminated. For that reason, the Secretary believes

complete surveys conducted as part of the Integrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS) in a timely manner and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the satisfaction of the Secretary could be burdensome to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, especially if the school did not have a large staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or computer systems capable of collecting information. Three of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the five commenters recommended that the Secretary design forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or specify formats to make data collection easier. One of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five commenters suggested that the Secretary accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions not yet computerized with more time to complete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys.

The language for this provision is statutory and may

not be changed by the Secretary. In addition, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that any survey conducted as part of IPEDS is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will provide valuable information to the Department. Those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices that collect IPEDS information work diligently to create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent, easy-to-use forms and formats, not just because this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes data collection easier for the institutions, but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it makes tabulating and sorting of the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easier. The Secretary does not believe this requirement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unduly burdensome to institutions.

One commenter suggested that by not allowing

institutions to impose penalties on students unable to meet their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial obligations due to disbursement delays for loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeds, this provision would force institutions to ``carry'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpaid students indefinitely, creating a financial burden. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested it was not the intent of the statute for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to allow an unpaid student to remain enrolled if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay in disbursement of loan proceeds was caused by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's failure to comply with a program requirement. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter recommended that the regulations stipulate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions would not be prohibited from withholding academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transcripts and other graduate services from students as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of delayed disbursement of Title IV, HEA program funds.

Discussion:

The language of this requirement is for the most

part statutory, and very clear in its intent. The Secretary does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not believe this requirement will cause a financial burden to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions as this situation should not frequently occur if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is complying with all applicable regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not probable that a student would deliberately cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delay of his or her loan disbursement by not complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the instructions of the institution or lender; nevertheless, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a situation occurred, the institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited from imposing penalties on the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The withholding of a student's academic transcript or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduate services is considered a penalty by the Secretary.

A very large number of commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations went beyond the scope of the statute by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibiting any type of incentive payments, particularly those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on ``retention.'' Most of those same commenters, plus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another large group, felt that token gifts to students and alumni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be excluded from this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that even in incentive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment structures based on retention there is room for abuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, in fact, has seen evidence of such abuse. Since July of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 when the Amendments of 1992 were enacted, many institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have opted to change to retention-based pay for admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. In that time, the Secretary has seen evidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowered satisfactory progress standards and in extreme cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falsified attendance and leave of absence requests, all in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to keep students enrolled. In many cases, these practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were designed by admissions personnel who were duly paid after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student passed a retention mark. After that mark, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students were dropped. Furthermore, the Secretary has evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some of these students were admitted using falsified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability-to-benefit tests, which further ties the issue of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retention to enrollment. The Secretary believes that reputable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conscientious institutions can develop other creative ways to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reward their employees that will have no direct or indirect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship to success in securing enrollments. Regarding token 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gifts for students and alumni who refer other students, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, after reviewing the comments, has decided that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices are widespread and will cause no harm if the tokens are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not monetary, and limits are placed both on their value and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of distribution.

token gifts may be given to students or alumni for referring

other students for admission to the institution, as long as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the gift is not money, check or money order;

dollars.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven commenters asserted that most institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer athletically related student aid are currently audited by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and that the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be amended to state that compilations and audits which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together satisfy NCAA and OMB also satisfy the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (d) and (e) of the regulation. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the proposed regulations paralleled NCAA audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and compliance should not pose a problem for member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. One commenter pointed out that a ``compilation'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a term defined under Statements on Standards for Accounting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review Services No.1 and only provides a representation without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any assurances on the statements. The commenter suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary require preparation of a schedule, and have that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule audited.

The Secretary believes that the requirements of the

statute and regulations stand on their own. It is up to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to determine if a particular audit or compilation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for a different organization satisfies the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of the regulation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is unwise to give blanket approval to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits and compilations which, although at present may satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation, may not at a later date. Furthermore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language of this provision, as written, covers all institutions,

felt this may create financial problems for both institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, and some recommended that program participation be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive to the date of application. Some other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felt program participation should be made retroactive to the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the certification review.

The language for this provision is statutory. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has no reason to believe that Congress had any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent when the law was drafted. However, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understands the concern of commenters that an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement might expire after an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has submitted a renewal application but before the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs a new program participation agreement. The Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified &sect;668.13 to address that concern. See the section of the

: A few commenters supported all of the Secretary's proposed regulations in &sect;668.15. One of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended the inclusion of a debt to net worth ratio in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering an institution's financial responsibility. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter, who disagreed with the Secretary's rationale for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the current ratio requirement from 1:1 to 1.25:1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the Secretary consider other types of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis such as a ``Z Score'' in evaluating an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial resources. Another commenter, who also disagreed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary, believed that tangible net worth was not an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate indicator of financial responsibility and recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary consider cash flow statements in his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary considered a number of alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio tests that could be used to evaluate an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial condition. While the Secretary does consider minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capitalization an important factor in determining an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility, he has elected not to put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a standard into regulation at this time. Based upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited information presented by in the commenters, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not convinced that a ``Z Score'' would be an appropriate measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial responsibility for an institution. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will monitor the financial information gathered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with these regulations to determine whether it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriate to require either additional, or alternative cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow statement criteria as a factor in determining financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility.

Many commenters responded to the Secretary's request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for comments regarding the acceptability of a ``bond rating'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient indicia of a nonprofit institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. The majority of the commenters expressed support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the use of a bond rating as a means of evaluating financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. One commenter suggested that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider an institution to be financially responsible if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to demonstrate that it has a debt financing arrangement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is acceptable to the College Construction Loan Authority (Connie 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lee). Another commenter believed that the Secretary should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broaden the definition of acceptable bonds to include other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general obligation bonds because certain types of revenue bonds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by pubic nonprofit institutions also have ratings by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized rating agencies. One commenter believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary should expand the provision to exempt for-profit institutions with an acceptable bond rating.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that a superior bond rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may serve as an effective proxy for demonstrating an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility. An institution that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capacity to issue a top rated debt security is, in general, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to have the financial resources necessary to meet all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its financial obligations. The Secretary believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt paying ability of an institution, as determined by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive credit review conducted by a nationally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical rating organization, is representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial health. For an institution's bond rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to serve as an acceptable proxy, the institution must have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial resources required to obtain a rating at or above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second highest level used by the rating organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Secretary requires that an institution provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that the issue has been rated without consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement that may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been used to lower the institution's cost of capital. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requires that an institution provide an actual rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Connie Lee is not a rating organization, financing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements that are acceptable to Connie Lee are only eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for consideration to the extent that they are separately rated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a nationally recognized rating organization that is acceptable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary. The Secretary agrees with commenters that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution of a bond rating for an institution's having to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate financial responsibility should be expanded to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include other forms of rated debt such as revenue bonds. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary also agrees that this provision should be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both nonprofit and for-profit institutions.

Secretary's requirement that an institution submit an audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly burdensome because the commenters believed an

Many commenters believed that the requirement for an institution to be current on any debt service should be clarified
to take into consideration legitimate disputes that may arise in the normal course of business. Several commenters
believed that a single instance or even a few instances of late payments would not necessarily be indicative of financial
problems. Many commenters believed that an institution should be considered current, despite not having made scheduled
payments, if the institution is currently involved in negotiations with creditors to restructure or reschedule
outstanding debt. A number of commenters suggested that a pattern of late payments on the part of an institution would
be a more reliable indicator of financial difficulty than would a single instance of failure to pay. Many of the commenters
suggested that the Secretary rely on the judgement of the institution's independent auditor in determining whether
or not such a pattern of late payment exists.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Secretary believes that an institution's ability to meet its financial obligations when due is indicative
of financial health. However, the Secretary recognizes that over the normal course of a business cycle an institution
may occasionally delay payment to certain trade creditors as a result of contractual disputes. Alternatively, the
Secretary recognizes that an institution that is experiencing cash flow problems will typically delay payment to
creditors in an effort to conserve cash. Clearly, if the cause of an institution's delay in making payment is contractual
in nature, than the Secretary expects that this would occur infrequently. If the cause is related to insufficient
cash flow, then the Secretary would expect to observe a recurring pattern of late payments to creditors. The Secretary
believes that payments related to long term liabilities such as term loans from financial institutions, bonds, debentures,
or notes payable which become due beyond one year are of significant importance because the institution's assets
are typically pledged, encumbered, or assigned to collateralize such obligations. The Secretary agrees with the
commenters that an institution is current, despite having failed to make scheduled payments, if the institution
has reached an acceptable agreement with creditors to substantially reschedule or restructure the outstanding
debt. However, the Secretary believes that a failure, on the part of the institution, to reach an agreement with creditors
after a reasonable period of time exposes the institution to potential financial and legal problems that may adversely
affect the quality of the institution's educational program. Information about the institution's outstanding
debt is already provided by the institution in its audited financial statement. Furthermore, the institution's
independent auditor has a responsibility to disclose any failure, on the part of the institution, to be in compliance
with loan agreements in existence on the date the institution's balance sheet was prepared.

 Section 668.15(b)(4) is amended to provide that an institution is not considered to be financially responsible if
the institution is not in compliance with all loan agreements in existence on the date the institution's financial
statements are prepared. However, the Secretary considers an institution to be current in its debt service if the
institution can provide evidence that it has reached a mutually acceptable agreement to restructure or reschedule
its obligations. If an institution is unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with creditors after 120 days
and the institution's failure to pay its obligations has resulted in a creditor taking legal action to attach the institution's
assets or obtain a judgment, then the institution shall not be considered to be financially responsible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters felt the requirement that an institution maintain a cash reserve was excessive. A few commenters
supported the requirement of the cash reserve and provided suggestions for alternative methods of calculating the
amount of the reserve requirement. A majority of the commenters who expressed a concern believed that the establishment
of a separate reserve account would significantly reduce available working capital funds that might be better applied
to meet other operating expenditures. Many commenters believed that nonprofit institutions should be allowed to
include amounts held in the cash reserve in the calculation of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities.
Some commenters supported the Secretary's position that the cash reserve account should be excluded from the calculation
of the ratio for nonprofit institutions. A number of the commenters thought that a more appropriate requirement would
be a cash reserve that is based on the institution's actual refund experience. A few commenters suggested that the
cash reserve requirement be based on the residual of total unearned tuition liability less accounts receivable,
with an adjustment for refunds made under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund policy. Many commenters suggested that the calculation of the reserve requirement on the basis of deferred
tuition revenue seemed arbitrary and indicated that it would vary greatly among institutions depending on the timing
of enrollments and the preparation of year end financial statements. Other commenters recommended that the Secretary
consider an annual financial statement along with cash flow projections for the next three enrollment periods as
an alternative to the cash reserve. A few commenters believed that the definition of acceptable forms of the cash reserve
should be expanded to include money market instruments, that are highly liquid and trade in an active secondary market.
Overall, the majority of the commenters believed that the provision should be removed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish requirements for an institution to maintain sufficient
cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds. The Secretary proposed that a cash reserve based on the
institution's deferred tuition revenue would be appropriate because the balance of the deferred tuition account
generally reflects amounts collected by, or contractually obligated to be received by, the institution in advance
of providing educational services. The Secretary believed an institution could reasonably expect that some students
would withdraw prior to the completion of their educational program and be entitled to a refund of amounts paid for
services not yet rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the commenters are correct in observing that the balance of deferred tuition revenue
would vary among institutions depending on factors that have little to do with actual refund payments by the institution,
such as enrollment periods and fiscal year ends. The Secretary believes that it would be more consistent with the intent
of the HEA for this provision to match the reserve requirement more closely with an institution's historical refund
experience. The Secretary believes that a cash reserve balance equal to one quarter of the institution's previous
year's total refund expenditure would be sufficient to satisfy the institutions cash reserve requirement because
that amount represents approximately three months potential refund expenditure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to establish the appropriate amount for the cash reserve, the institution will have to disclose, in a note
to its audited financial statements, the dollar amount of total refunds paid in both the current fiscal year and prior
year. The Secretary does not consider internally generated cash flow projections as reliable indicators of an institution's
ability to meet the cash reserve requirement. The Secretary does not consider liquid investments, such as money market
funds, to be equivalent to cash because such investments do not generally have a maturity date and are therefore more
characteristic of equity investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Secretary acknowledges the criticism from the commenters that the establishment of a cash reserve reduces
available working capital, the Secretary points out that the establishment of a reserve account requires the accumulation
of cash on a one-time basis. Contributions to the reserve account would be required only to the extent that enrollment
levels and refund experiences vary. On a continuing basis, the resulting net outflow of working capital would be the
same despite the establishment of a cash reserve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that nonprofit institutions should be treated consistently with for-profit
institutions, and allowed to include the cash reserve in the calculation of the liquidity ratios. The reserve account
is intended to provide an immediately available source of cash that must be available to make refunds at any time. It
is reasonable to expect that if an institution were to close at other than the end of an academic period that the cash
reserve funds would be used to pay the institution's refund liability. Since unpaid refunds are generally recognized
as a current liability it is appropriate to recognize, in the institution's ratio calculation, those assets which
would actually be used to offset the liability in the event of liquidation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation will restrict the type of account in which the cash reserve must be kept because it must be maintained
at a certain minimum level at all times. Accordingly, an institution may not hold reserve funds in any type of investment
that is subject to significant price variation. The Secretary believes only cash held in the form of a demand deposit
in a federally insured bank account, or short term investments secured by the full faith and credit of the United States
meet this criteria.

The Secretary amends the cash reserve requirement in &sect;668.15(b)(5) to require an institution to maintain at
all times, a cash reserve equal to one-quarter of the total dollar amount of refunds paid by the institution in the previous
fiscal year. Such reserves shall be maintained in a cash deposit in a federally insured bank account or, in U.S. Treasury
securities, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States having an original maturity of three months or
less.

Many commenters believed that the requirement that for-profit institutions maintain a ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of 1.25:1 was burdensome and exceeded the scope of the statute. One commenter supported the ratio
requirement and suggested that a current ratio of 1.6:1 up to 2:1 might be a more appropriate standard of financial
responsibility. The majority of commenters who expressed concern regarding the ratio requirement indicated that
they believed the Secretary's justification for applying a higher standard to for-profit institutions was unsupported
and discriminatory. Many commenters believed that the Secretary should not attempt to distinguish between for-profit
and nonprofit institutions. Among the commenters who expressed a concern, most believed that the establishment
of separate ratio tests for each type of institution was not required by the HEA. Some of the commenters believed that
the exclusion of uncollateralized related party receivables from the calculation of current assets was inconsistent
with generally accepted accounting principles. A number of commenters suggested that a phase-in period ranging
from twelve months to more than five years should be granted to allow institutions time to build up working capital
reserves in order to comply with this standard.

Many commenters believed that in applying this standard the Secretary was effectively mandating that for-profit
institutions divert available funds away from capital assets such as facilities, supplies, and equipment and into
lower yielding short term investments. While the Secretary recognizes the possibility that a higher current ratio
requirement could theoretically lead to greater inefficiencies in the use of funds, the Secretary believes that
higher levels of working capital afford greater financial flexibility to institutions and thus provide greater
protection against the possibility of unexpected closure. The Secretary believes that Congress intended to ensure
through regulation that students are afforded every reasonable protection with regard to their attendance at an
institution through which they are receiving HEA funds. The Secretary also believes that the numerous fundamental
differences in accounting and funding methods for nonprofit and for-profit institutions provide sufficient justification
for the application of different standards to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Secretary believes that a change in the current ratio requirement is appropriate to take into consideration
differing financial and operating structures while employing similar standards for both for-profit and nonprofit
institutions. In order to implement a uniform standard that may be used for different types of institutions, the Secretary
believes that it is appropriate to exclude certain assets and liabilities from the calculation of the analytical
ratios. As discussed in more detail below, the Secretary believes institutions that are currently in compliance
with the existing standards of financial responsibility will not require a grace period to meet the new standards.

In &sect;&sect;668.15(b)(7)(i)(A) and (b)(8)(i)(B), the Secretary has replaced the current ratio requirement

accounts receivable divided by current liabilities. In applying this standard, the Secretary excludes from the
ratio calculation all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables as well as all other assets not specifically
identified in the above ratio calculation.

Several commenters were concerned that the Secretary is involved in attempting to set accounting standards by requiring
classified statements of financial position for nonprofit institutions reporting under Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement 117 (FASB 117), Financial Statements for Not-for-Profit Organizations.

The Secretary is aware that presenting the statement of financial position of a nonprofit institution as a classified
statement of financial position is a matter of management decision. However, during the negotiated rule making process,
the need for comparable financial responsibility and accounting standards became evident. This need must be reconciled
in some manner, despite the varying accounting standards between for-profit and nonprofit entities. The Secretary
does not permit this information to be presented in a supplementary schedule because supplementary schedules are
not subject to audit tests, as are notes to the financial statements. The information concerning current assets and
current liabilities does not have to be included as part of the audit but may be included in the notes to the financial
statements. Preparation of a classified statement of financial position is included as an option under FASB 117.
The Secretary is therefore not setting standards but merely requiring that presentation be made in accordance with
one of those options in particular.

Many commenters believed that implementation of the proposed regulations should be delayed for at least a year, with
most commenters expressed stating that the increased current ratio requirement and cash reserve requirement would
require institutions to accumulate additional cash or other liquid assets.

The Secretary believes institutions that are in compliance with the current standards for financial responsibility
will not require a significant period of time to implement the proposed changes. For many institutions, the acid test
ratio proposed by the Secretary will measure exactly the same elements as the former current ratio did. The establishment
of a separate cash reserve should not impact the calculation to a great extent because the cash reserve balance will
be included in the ratio calculation. Because the acid test ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity, the Secretary
only requires that an institution demonstrate parity between its most liquid assets and its current obligations.
The accumulation of significant liquid assets would generally not be required by an institution. The Secretary believes
that it is reasonable to expect that an institution has at least as much cash on hand and current receivables as it does
current obligations.

Past performance of an institution or persons affiliated with an

institution. Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters were concerned about the proposal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the requirements whereby an institution is not considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be financially responsible if an individual, who exercises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial control over any other existing institutions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defunct institution or third-party servicer, owes a liability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a violation of a Title IV requirement, and is not making payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to an agreement established with the Secretary to repay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the liability. Several commenters wanted all references to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member or members of a person's family deleted from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations citing that people should not be held financially or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally responsible for the actions of members of their family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have reached their majority. Another commenter was concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the inclusion of a member of the person's family without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to whether there is any partnership between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and felt that this requirement unnecessarily broadens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scope of the requirement. Several commenters suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percentage of ownership interest used to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial control over an institution or third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be set at 50 percent rather than 25 percent stating that a 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent ownership interest does not mean that the person has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 498(e)(4)(B) refers to audit findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 5 percent of an institution's Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds for any award year. The Secretary considers this statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to be designed to require the consideration of the loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that amount of Title IV, HEA program funds, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether that loss was identified from an audit or as the result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a program review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers the criteria in the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15(c)(2) to be indicative of serious problems with financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. An institution in one of these categories has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already failed to comply properly with the Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and has had the opportunity, during its appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or other negotiations with the Department's officials, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate any mitigating circumstances that might have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified reducing or eliminating the sanction or finding. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary agrees with the commenters who suggested that one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the categories of past performance problems should be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect a failure of an institution to resolve satisfactorily any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant compliance problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is satisfied that citing an institution for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to submit acceptable required audit reports in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion is a better standard of past performance problems than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final determination. A final determination is issued only after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an acceptable audit report has been submitted and the findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been formally issued to the institution. An institution can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be cited for failure to submit an audit report in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion, and an institution can have its audit report returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the report is unacceptable. These actions do not imply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution has committed any other violations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program requirements, but it is essential for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to have acceptable audit reports on time so that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary can evaluate whether the institution is appropriately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.

has been revised to provide that the failure to resolve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters suggested that performance bonds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be accepted to meet the standard for surety amounting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 50 percent of total Title IV HEA program funding under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute. The commenters contended that performance bonds may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide equal, if not better, protection to the Secretary than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letters of credit because it is often possible to collect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance bonds even after the expiration date.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary has determined that the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection afforded by performance bonds is not sufficient due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relative difficulty in collecting against such instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to recoveries under a letter of credit. In some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances involving school closures where a performance bond was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place, the Secretary might be required to submit and document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims on a student-by-student basis before a third party before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collecting the full amount of institutional liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collection under an irrevocable letter of credit has proven to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable and effective in protecting the federal interests.

 A number of commenters responded to the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request in the February 28, 1994 NPRM for specific standards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be employed to measure the acceptability of a State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition recovery fund. Several commenters recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department only require states to certify that the fund can pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all required refunds on behalf of schools that close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitously. Some of the commenters recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary take into consideration the success of various teach-out measures which exist in the various states. One
commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended removal of the exemption because many charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with attending an institution that are properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in refunds are not considered part of tuition, and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be recoverable by the student in the event an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closes. The commenter went on to recommend that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an actuarial analysis and certification of full funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before considering a fund acceptable. Some of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that a State's tuition recovery fund should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable if the State has taxing authority to require schools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to contribute to the fund. One commenter provided the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a number of suggestions including: assessing the extent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund obligation that the fund would cover, the current funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level, maximum fund balance, amounts of annual assessments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of annual claims, the authority of the fund's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrator and the historical experience of the fund. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter believed that the Department would not effectively be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to evaluate the State's tuition recovery fund. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that the acceptability of the state's tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery fund should be determined by comparing a State fund's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established maximum payout to an individual institution's annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan volume.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, the Secretary believes that a State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition recovery fund will be found to be acceptable where it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the backing of the full faith and credit of the State and agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to administer such refund payments in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the HEA programs. Based upon historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience, State tuition recovery funds have been poorly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capitalized and fund administrators have little authority to levy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments. Many of the funds will pay refunds only for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students currently enrolled, and not to students that were owed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds when the institution closed. Other State tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery funds have only provided protection to in-state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents and, in general, have capped payments at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predetermined maximum level without regard to the refund owed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the HEA programs. Some problems have also arisen where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds were being made directly to students on a first-come, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-served basis that exhausted the available funds without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apportioning them ratably to the funding sources that should have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received the refunds for the benefit of those students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these concerns regarding the acceptability of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition recovery funds, the Secretary does not believe it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to address these criteria through regulation at this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. The Secretary will continue to review this issue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine what standards, if any, may be set out through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation.

 One commenter supported the requirement that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution maintain a minimum cash reserve equal to 10 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of deferred tuition revenue but believed that an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributions to a State's tuition recovery fund should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in calculating the reserve requirement. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted that the North Carolina General Statute 115D&hyph;90 requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to maintain a guaranty bond in an amount equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an institution's deferred tuition revenue at peak enrollment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed that students were already afforded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable protection under the bond requirement and suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the cash reserve be required when no other form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection exists. Another commenter believed that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should fully exempt institutions which retain deferred tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts through independently administered escrow arrangements.

 Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA requires that all

institutions maintain a minimum cash reserve. The requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an institution to maintain a cash reserve does not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions which reside in a State that has a tuition recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund if that state's tuition recovery fund is acceptable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. As discussed above, under certain situations an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may be able to demonstrate that the State tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery fund to which it contributes will supplant the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's requirement to maintain a separate cash reserve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such an instance, the institution will not be able to treat

 One commenter believed that the requirement for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to demonstrate a positive tangible net worth would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discourage employee ownership of institutions because amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invested in employee stock ownership plans (ESOP's) are treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as intangibles and would be excluded from the calculation of net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth. Furthermore, the commenter believed that this particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was retroactive because intangibles that may have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquired several years ago would still appear on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's balance sheet. The same commenter believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the expense item representing amortization of intangibles should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded from the calculation of operating loss in view of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's exclusion of intangible assets from the calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tangible net worth. Another commenter requested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary consider the market value of assets purchased years ago 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and carried at depreciated book value on the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statement. One commenter believed that intangibles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be excluded only if the Secretary has reason to believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the value of these assets does not reflect an arm's length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, an intangible asset has no physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence and depends on some expected future benefit to derive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its value. While the Secretary believes that the presence of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intangible on an institution's balance sheet can, and often does, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imply some future economic benefit to the institution, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not believe that such an asset should be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the institution's net worth calculation to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution demonstrates financial responsibility for HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program purposes. The Secretary does not believe that it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be necessary to exclude the expense item in the calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating losses. Generally accepted accounting principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that an institution show asset values at historical cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less accumulated depreciation. In the ordinary course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, it would not be possible for the Secretary to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination regarding the current market value of any asset 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless that asset was actually sold in an arm's length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction or an actuarial valuation was obtained in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the Secretary. Administrative efficiency and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preference for certainty as documented through the audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements warrant the exclusion of such items.

 Two commenters felt that audited financial statements should be submitted only once every four years, when most institutions
are recertified. The commenters believed that the statute allows for this limited reporting. A few commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the submission of an audited financial statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be accepted by the Secretary as sufficient evidence to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide the educational services for which its students are

acid test ratio is based on information contained in an

 The Secretary requires the submission of two years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial data on an annual basis. To be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible, an institution must demonstrate that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not experienced operating losses in either or both of its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recently completed fiscal years that in sum total more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ten percent of the institution's total net worth at the beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the first year in the two year period. The Secretary shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make this determination on the basis of financial information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the institution in the form of an audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparative financial statement representing each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's two most recently completed fiscal years or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparing information provided by the institution in the form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two individual audited financial statements, each representing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the institution's two most recently completed fiscal

years.

 Many commenters believed that the requirement for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to submit an audited financial statement within four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months of the institution's fiscal year end was burdensome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because institutions were also required to perform compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits during the year at points that did not necessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coincide with the institution's fiscal year end. As a result the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be required to incur additional audit costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would be unnecessary if both audits could be performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously. To accomplish this, the commenters requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary extend the period in which audits are due from four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months to within six months of the institution's fiscal year end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters believed that the requirement for an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit an audited financial statement within four months of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fiscal year end contradicted the objectives of the Single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Audit Act, and OMB circular A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133, because timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences related to the availability of information would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in an institution being required perform both a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit and a compliance audit. Another commenter noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits prepared in accordance with the Single Audit Act were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable under 34 CFR 668.23(f), and suggested that an audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared in accordance with the Single Audit Act ought to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the Secretary in other sections of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that a four month period provides ample opportunity for an institution to accomplish the preparation
and audit of fiscal year end financial statements. The reliability of any financial statement, as a fair representation
of the institution's true financial condition, is largely dependent on the timeliness of the financial report. The
Secretary believes that four months is reasonable and notes that many thousands of publicly traded corporations
make timely submissions under the 3 month time frame set by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the submission
of annual audited financial statements. The Secretary may, however, grant an extension on an individual basis where
the institution demonstrates a sufficient basis for the extension. An institution that is required to report in accordance
with OMB circular A&hyph;128 or A&hyph;133 under the Single Audit Act will continue to be governed by the reporting
requirements specified under that act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed changes to this section generated many comments. Some commenters asserted that many of the proposed standards
go far beyond the issue of administrative capability. Some argued that the Secretary would exceed the authority of
the HEA if the proposed revisions were retained in final regulations. Some commenters argued that some of the issues
addressed in this section were subject to review by accrediting agencies or SPREs and inclusion in these standards
would result in duplication of effort on the part of the Triad agencies and institutions. Some commenters believed
the proposed standards to be needlessly detailed and complex. Some commenters stated that the proposed standards
were too broad. Some commenters strongly opposed the clarification that institutions would be expected to comply
with all the standards in order to be fully certified. Some commenters noted that there was no effort to weigh the relative
importance of the various proposed elements of administrative capability and recommended that the section be revised
to prioritize the various standards. Some commenters recommend that the elements of administrative capability
in &sect;668.16 be considered indicators, not absolutes. Some commenters requested that the Secretary provide
more specificity in the regulations so that institutions would know precisely what was requested of them and when.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary appreciates the many thoughtful comments on the various aspects of regulating in the area of administrative
capability. The Secretary found many of the constructive recommendations made by commenters to be useful in modifying
some standards, crafting more precise language for other standards, and understanding why some proposed standards
are unnecessary or should not be imposed at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments, the Secretary has modified the proposed administrative standards significantly. While specific
changes are discussed in detail in connection with the applicable section, the Secretary believes it may be useful
to note some of the principles and rationale which guided the refinement of the administrative standards. The Secretary
made many changes in sections where commenters pointed out that the same goal could be reached by requiring less detail
or action by those institutions that demonstrated a history of compliance with regulations governing the Title IV,
HEA programs and imposing more on requirements or restrictions on institutions that have either no track record or
have a record of problems administering the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary also made adjustments in those proposed
standards where there was overlap with the responsibilities of accrediting agencies or SPREs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary did not find persuasive the comments of those who urged that the elements be considered as indicators
of administrative capability instead of absolutes, or that the standards be prioritized to indicate relative importance.
Requiring that institutions meet each and every standard is critical to successful enforcement by the Secretary.
If institutions were not required to do so, institutions could argue that they had substantially complied with the
administrative capability standards and it would be difficult for the Department to enforce compliance. The Secretary
has determined that only way to become a more effective gatekeeper is to select critical standards, put institutions
on notice that they are responsible for adhering to them_by requiring that each standard of administrative capability
be met_and taking action when they are not.

The Secretary appreciates the support of those commenters who understand the importance of making it clear that an

Many commenters supported the idea that the Department recognize quality training provided by State, regional,
or national financial aid administrators or guaranty agencies as a factor in the determination of a designated individual's
ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs at an institution. One commenter noted that while attendance at training
workshops may be beneficial, the workshops have no means of assessing whether attendees have achieved a given level
of knowledge. While a few commenters acknowledged that the caliber of training varies and suggested a system that
recognizes a variety of training options, no one responded to the Secretary's request for criteria to consider in
approving non-Federal training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters recommended that to be deemed a ``capable individual'' an aid administrator should be
required to satisfy a training or certification requirement. Many commenters noted that a continuing education
requirement might be appropriate, also. Some of the commenters who advocated a continuing education requirement
recommended that such training be required to be reported to the Secretary or be attested to by the institution's auditor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of those commenters who advocated a certification requirement, most opposed national certification because they
felt it would be costly and might duplicate State certification efforts. However, two commenters did advocate national
certification or credentials. A few commenters opposed certification and noted that one State had discarded certification
several years ago; one commenter noted that the Secretary has not shown any evidence that State-certified training
leads to or correlates with improved administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. One commenter who recommended
that experience, training, or certification be required specified that the requirement should apply to ``at least''
the individual operationally in charge of the financial aid office.

Several commenters provided additional suggestions for factors to use in determining whether an individual is capable:
An individual's record of timeliness and accuracy in administration of Title IV, HEA programs; an individual's years
of experience administering Title IV, HEA programs; an individual's on-going attendance at workshops and seminars
during each award year; and an individual's record of compliance with Title IV, HEA program regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary appreciates the comments from those individuals and organizations that supported making some kind
of training, certification, or continuing education a requirement. The Secretary continues to believe that State
certification, as well as participation in and completion of quality workshops and training programs, are good indicators
of a ``capable individual'' and intends to consider these factors in evaluating capability. However, the Secretary
does not see the need at this time to make training or certification a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the lack of response to the solicitation of suggestions on training elements the Secretary might use to evaluate
and approve nondepartmental training, the Secretary believes that quality training programs exist outside the
Department that would be beneficial in determining an individual's capability and will continue to solicit advice
as to how such programs might be identified and approved. To encourage suggestions on appropriate approval of training
programs and to facilitate the use of any training programs approved in the future to evaluate capability, the Secretary
retains, without change, the provision in the final regulations that would accommodate training approved by the
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that previous experience and documented success in properly administering Title IV, HEA programs
are germane to the evaluation of an individual's capability.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vast majority of commenters opposed strongly the use of any prescriptive staffing standards to evaluate the adequacy
of staffing levels at institutions. Many commenters were concerned that there are too many variables_number and
type of professional programs offered by an institution, level of staff experience, degree of centralized processing,
use of third-party servicers, and diversity of the student body, in addition to the factors listed in &sect;668.16(b)(2)_to
permit an accurate assessment of the adequacy of staff levels. A number of commenters expressed the concern that small
institutions would be penalized if staff levels were stipulated in regulations. Many commenters stated that adequate
staffing should not be an issue unless an institution demonstrates problems administering the Title IV, HEA programs,
as reflected in audits, program reviews, or student complaints. One commenter noted that during the negotiated rulemaking
sessions, non-Federal negotiators explained and stressed the potential negative impact on current aid office staffing
levels that could result from creating an artificial ratio of aid applicants or recipients to financial aid administrators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters provided suggestions on how to evaluate the adequacy of staffing levels at institutions or recommended
that the Secretary analyze workload issues and develop appropriate formulae. Other commenters recommended to the
Secretary a recent staffing survey conducted for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators
(NASFAA) as an appropriate model to use in developing more precise measures of staff adequacy. A few commenters believed
that currently participating institutions should be judged on the basis of their track record, but thought that use
of ratios of aid applicants or recipients to financial aid administrators might be helpful in the assessment of the
administrative capability of institutions applying for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first
time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that, in general, a currently participating institution's compliance with the other standards
of administrative capability can serve as a reliable indicator that a financial aid office is staffed adequately.
However, if an institution adds a branch campus or other location, starts using or stops using a third-party servicer,
or makes other changes that would have an impact on the administrative capability of the institution, the Secretary
believes it may be necessary to look more closely at the institution's staffing pattern. Further, an institution
that undergoes a change of ownership that results in a change of control may experience a change in its enrollment level
and financial aid office personnel and should be subject to review of its staffing level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Secretary intends to use the list of factors in this section especially to assess the adequacy of staffing
at institutions that make these changes, at institutions that are applying for initial participation, and at institutions
with documented compliance violations. However, the Secretary expects all institutions to be able to demonstrate
that they have an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA programs properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to those factors identified in the proposed regulations, the Secretary agrees with those commenters
that the use of third-party servicers could have a significant impact on the institution's ability to administer
the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the lack of information available currently about establishing meaningful ratios of staff to student applicants
or recipients, the Secretary is not adding a ratio to the factors used to evaluate even new institutions at this time.

A few commenters argued that requiring communication of information from any institutional office that receives
information that has a bearing on student eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance to the person designated
to be responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs was very labor intensive and should be removed. One commenter
stated that the specifications for interoffice communications bear no relationship to an expected outcome.

that students are eligible for the amounts of Title IV, HEA program assistance they receive and that the status of borrowers
is updated, when appropriate.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A dozen commenters objected to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that institutions have written procedures or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regarding several key aspects of the administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Title IV, HEA programs. Most of these commenters stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed requirement was burdensome and would create a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot of paperwork with no discernible benefit. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted that communications processes and structures are dynamic by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature and thus subject to frequent changes. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concern that the Secretary was trying to dictate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern and frequency of communications among college offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter added that while development of written procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as those proposed would be good management practice, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should not regulate such practices. Some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters recommended that this proposed requirement be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entirely. Other commenters recommended that the requirement be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed only on institutions that did not have a record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering the Title IV, HEA programs successfully or only on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that institutions be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show compliance through their computer systems. One commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that the time required to provide detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation would take valuable time away from the smoothly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
running delivery of aid, recommended that general delineation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities be considered sufficient. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that institutions be permitted to work out the method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and frequency of communication. One commenter asked that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary clarify how this provision relates to multi-campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions if the proposal were retained in final regulations.

 The Secretary is not persuaded that mandating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written procedures or information covering certain aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA administration is an inappropriate or unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standard. However, the Secretary appreciates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern of commenters who perceived certain areas of the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be unduly burdensome. The Secretary agrees that the burden to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution of having to prepare written procedures for or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written information indicating the nature and frequency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication of pertinent information among all the offices that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs outweighs the benefit that this provision would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary. The Secretary also agrees that, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance problems relevant to the listed responsibilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified, institutions may satisfy the requirement that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution have written procedures for or written information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of

 A number of commenters discussed the issue of

appropriate separation of awarding and disbursing functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of these commenters said the prohibition on having family

members perform the two functions would be onerous, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a small, family-run institution. In a similar vein, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters noted that in a small institution the owner works and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has responsibility over all facets of the institution. At small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, it is very difficult to provide for organizational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independence. Many commenters suggested deleting the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language that references family members and individuals that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control over both functions and relying on the annual audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process to test for adequate internal controls.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard was strengthened to provide additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterrence to collusion, which is a big problem at institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that engage in fraud and at many institutions that fail to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds. The strengthened language also gives the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added, needed authority to terminate institutions that engage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Secretary understands the concern of small family-run institutions that arranging for someone outside
the family to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform one or both tasks will be burdensome, the suggestion that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary delete the new language and rely on the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial and compliance audit is not realistic. At very small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, the auditor would probably conclude that there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no internal controls because there are only two or three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees_often the owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received in excess of sixty comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions that address satisfactory academic progress. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vast majority of commenters were opposed to the proposed addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;668.16(e)(3)(ii)(B), which stipulates that undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students would be expected to complete their educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 150% of the published length of the programs as a standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for measuring a student's satisfactory academic progress. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the proposed new provision be removed. A few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters argued that implementation of the provision would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an infringement of the academic freedom of institutions. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others asserted that requiring this level of detail in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's satisfactory academic progress standards is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unwarranted, because it interferes with institutions' academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, and argued that the proposed new requirement bears no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discernible relationship to administrative capability standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters opposed the inclusion of any satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic progress requirements in the standards for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters were opposed to the proposed new criterion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing the maximum time frame because they believed that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not take into consideration the academic career patterns of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nontraditional students who work and have varying hours, attend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part-time, or need remedial academic help, often interspersing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental courses with courses taken for credit. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter contended that this provision would discriminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against students who change majors or eligible programs. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters argued that implementation of the proposed provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in the cut-off of Title IV, HEA program funds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students in these categories even though the students may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious and highly motivated. Thus, students who would otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to complete an eligible program would be denied that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity because they could continue with their education only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they received Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended that students be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal this provision on a case-by-case basis. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurred with the provision as written and stated the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is part of the current policy of the commenter's institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the required increments of time for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of a maximum time frame in which the student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete his or her educational program do not work for a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as court reporting, where the time it takes students to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a given amount of work may vary from 3 to 12 months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because students are required by Title IV of the HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to maintain satisfactory progress to receive Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance, it is only logical that an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to administer Title IV, HEA programs must be judged, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, on the existence and implementation of an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory progress policy. The proposed addition is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codification of longstanding policy and is consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Student-Right-to-Know Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a maximum time frame would take into account a student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment status. Institutions are currently required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor enrollment status of students receiving Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds and 150% of published program length can and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be viewed only in the context of an individual student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment status. Thus, if a nontraditional student who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in a baccalaureate program that a full-time student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to complete in four years and a half-time student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to complete in eight years, vacillates between full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and half-time enrollment, that student would have a computed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum enrollment period somewhere between six and 12 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because the requirement is designed to set an upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit on the period of time for which a student may receive Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program assistance, periods of nonenrollment, during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student is not receiving Title IV, HEA program funds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be counted against the length of time the student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuing a degree or certificate. Thus, a student who enrolls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and receives Title IV, HEA program funds sporadically would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated differently from a full-time student who pursues a degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or certificate without interruption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to have procedures under which a student may appeal a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that the student is not making satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress. With regard to eligible programs of an academic year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or less, these regulations make even clearer the longstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that the maximum time frame must be divided into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increments. Satisfactory academic progress policies are expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to measure whether students are progressing satisfactorily toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their educational goals and should serve also as a device for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counseling students about their need to improve their progress, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if applicable. If maximum time frames are not divided into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increments, these policies are not serving their purpose. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle applies to programs shorter than an academic year no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than to longer programs.

 Two commenters recommended expanding the requirement

that an institution must develop and apply an adequate system to

identify and resolve discrepancies in the information that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution receives to include documentation of a student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
social security number. They reasoned that resolution of social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security number discrepancies is an important part of controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraud and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs and the ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution to obtain appropriate documentation to resolve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such discrepancies should be considered in determining

documentation of a student's social security number in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information normally available to an institution and for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must have a system to identify and resolve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrepancies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 About half the commenters expressed concern, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varying degrees, that the proposed reporting requirement is too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vague and broad and would result in overreporting that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overwhelm the Office of Inspector General. Some of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters recommended that the word ``evidence'' replace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``information.'' Other commenters suggested that there be some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of internal review or discussion. Several commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that institutions continue to make referrals to local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law enforcement officials or at least consult with them. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters wanted assurance that the institution would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected in the event that it made a referral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary cannot accept the substitution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``evidence'' for ``information'' because that the word ``evidence'' has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal ramifications. Evidence is normally determined in a court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of law when the judge determines what permissible evidence is. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions may contact the Office of Investigations within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Inspector General for advice before making a formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral. The Secretary also cannot accept the suggestion that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions establish an internal review mechanism prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral as such a mechanism may work to block appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referrals. However, the Secretary believes that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should only be required to refer to the Office of the Inspector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General of the Department of Education 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
credible
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating fraud and abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary sees no problem with institutions making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent referrals to local law enforcement authorities, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot support the referral to local authorities as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to making referrals to the Office of Inspector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General. Concurrent referrals can be made with the regulation as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written; no change is necessary. The Secretary cannot guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to institutions or individuals that make referrals.

 Almost two-thirds of the commenters supported the

concept of requiring institutions that serve significant numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of students with special needs to have and implement plans for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing students with information about how to meet their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs, but half of these commenters recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement be imposed only on institutions with high withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. Two commenters recommended that institutions be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually to provide the necessary support services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that students with language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barriers be considered to have special needs. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that students from low socio-economic background, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by using the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures under the Federal Need Analysis formula, be determined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have special needs. Those commenters who responded to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's request for how to define significant number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested either that 66 percent of total enrollment be used, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would be consistent with the mitigating circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold for appealing determinations of excessive cohort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rates, or that percentages of enrollment, for example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five percent, 10 percent, or 20 percent, be used as thresholds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the number of students.

Of the commenters who opposed the proposed requirement, almost half argued that there is no connection between the
proposed regulation and administrative capability and the Secretary therefore should not regulate in this area.
A half dozen commenters believed that students were aware of their own special needs and it was their responsibility
to ensure that these needs were met. Several other commenters believed the proposed requirement was unnecessary
because either institutions that had students with special needs were already attending to those needs, or such students
would already be getting help from appropriate social service agencies. One commenter who objected strongly to the
proposal noted, among other concerns, that students need to learn to become self reliant and that employers with whom
the commenter's institution deal say the institution is already coddling its students too much.

Two commenters supported the provision that would require institutions to have procedures for receiving, investigating,
and resolving student complaints but requested that the Secretary clarify the proposed language. One of these commenters
asked that the Secretary make it clear that institutions would be expected to handle only those complaints related
to the educational programs and support services offered by the institution. The other commenter thought that institutions
should be required to publicize their system for handling complaints and maintain a log of student complaints.

The Secretary appreciates the commenters' support; it is good administrative practice to have a mechanism to resolve
student complaints. However, the Secretary has decided the proposed requirement is not an essential administrative
standard as there will be other means of addressing student complaints about an institution. Each SPRE will be setting
up a student complaint system to process student complaints about the postsecondary institutions in its State. Further,
SPREs will be reviewing the handling of student complaints at institutions they review. Accrediting agencies will
also be required to assess student complaints about institutions they consider.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary received many comments on the proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aimed at institutions with educational programs with the stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of preparing a student for gainful employment in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation. Many of the commenters opposed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirements that the institution: (1) demonstrate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable relationship between the length of the program and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational entry level requirements and (2) establish the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the training. The commenters believe the responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of program length and the need for training rests with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other members of the Triad, principally the accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Some of these commenters argued that if the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to regulate in this area, the Secretary would exceed his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory authority and be intervening inappropriately in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic affairs. Other commenters asserted that need for or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of training programs has nothing to do with ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to administer Title IV, HEA programs. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters recommended the elimination of this proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some commenters were concerned that the standard, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed, is unreasonably vague, other commenters charged that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary would be micromanaging if it were implemented. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of these commenters noted that, for several reasons, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be difficult to determine whether program length really is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Many commenters noted that their students are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared and hired for positions that are above entry level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters saw the proposed standard as harmful or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unworkable because of the use of minimum State standards as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of appropriate length. One commenter noted that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no provision for evaluation of the method by which a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines the minimum hours. Another commenter said State-mandated hours are too low. Other commenters questioned
what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would happen if the State sets an inappropriate length. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter represented an institution that trains students from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many States, each with different minimum requirements, and argued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would be entirely inappropriate to limit the length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that institution's programs based on the minimum standard of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State in which the institution is located. Many commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the proposed regulation is unnecessary. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that disclosures to prospective students are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated under the Student Right-to-Know Act and that SPRE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards will be addressing the abuses of the type described in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposed this provision to curb 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing abuses in these areas. The Secretary questions the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motives of any institution that claims it is necessary to greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the minimum number of clock hours required by the State in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the institution is located for adequate training for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular occupation. The Secretary is also concerned with any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that provides training for occupations for which no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training is necessary, or for which on-the-job training is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate. Although an institution's SPRE and accrediting agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may regulate in these general areas, the Secretary believes it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
specifically
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 target areas of past abuse. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary believes it is consistent to require an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program and occupational entry level requirements established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by any Federal agency. See the discussion in the

However, the Secretary was persuaded by the commenters who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that need for or length of training programs is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly linked to the ability of institutions to administer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is more appropriate as a requirement for participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

ideas to clarify and expand the proposed requirements. Most of

the other commenters asserted that the proposed requirements did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary continues to believe that providing

students, so they can make informed decisions, is a function of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement is covered in the section on the Program

While the Secretary continues to believe that

advertising, promotion and recruitment practices that reflect the

One commenter suggested that there might be a timing

problem for an institution that is in the process of responding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an audit report in which liabilities have been identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter recommended that the Secretary expand the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language that would require that an institution have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding liabilities, unless it has made satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements to repay them, to allow for liabilities the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is currently in the process of making provisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay. Another commenter stated that this provision duplicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the financial responsibility requirements proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15(b) (3) and (4) and recommended that it be removed from the

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The one commenter apparently believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities are established at the time an audit report is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued. Contrary to the commenter's perception, institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided with the opportunity to respond to an issued audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report before liabilities are established. However, once the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit report and institutional response have been reviewed and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final program determination letter establishing liabilities has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been issued, an institution must either repay the liabilities or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make satisfactory arrangements to repay. Responding to audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, making any necessary corrections to institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, and making satisfactory arrangements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment of any liabilities established are all fundamental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities of participating institutions. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary agrees that these responsibilities are adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerated in the general standards of financial responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;668.15(b).

The majority of commenters asserted that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that an institution show no evidence of significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems identified in reviews of the institution was overly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad and imprecise, giving the Secretary unlimited authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny certification because of evidence of problems in a wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of areas. They recommended that the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be rewritten to limit the scope. Many of these commenters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that institutions would be penalized even if there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a problem unrelated to Title IV, HEA programs matters. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example given was that of a university hospital that was found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of Medicare reimbursement rules. Some commenters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that the Secretary would deny certification based on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit finding or other citation that had not yet been reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and upheld in a final audit determination or similar action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They urged that only serious findings upheld in final audit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program review determinations or legal proceedings be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed concern that the Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny certification to an institution on the basis of a SPRE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review, even if the SPRE itself thought the institution should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still receive student aid. Two commenters argued that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, as proposed, would affect the institutions involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Department of Justice investigation of the Overlap Group, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though they have signed a consent decree. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the provision be removed.

The proposed regulation was intended to allow the Secretary to consider evidence of problems in administering Title
IV, HEA programs, as documented not only in reports and determinations issued by the Secretary but by other agencies,
identified in proposed &sect;668.16(p)(1), in determining of administrative capability. The Secretary understands
the commenters' concern that this was not clearly stated in the proposed regulation and agrees to clarify that the
Secretary intends to take into account evidence of significant problems that have a bearing on the administration
of the Title IV, HEA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary plans to use problems identified in final reports and determinations
in evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However, the Secretary cannot accede to commenters'
urging that only findings for which institutions have exhausted all appeal procedures be considered. If, for example,
the Office of Inspector General, a guarantee agency, and an institution's accrediting agency all issued final reports
identifying major Title IV, HEA compliance problems, including failure to make appropriate refunds, and a $1 million
liability, it would be unconscionable for the Secretary to fully certify the institution because the institution
had not had time to exhaust the appeal opportunities of the various oversight agencies.

Some commenters supported the proposed requirement that an institution comply with any standards established by
the State in which the institution is located or, if no such standards exist, standards developed by the Secretary
regarding completion rates, placements rates and pass rates on required State examinations. Many other commenters
requested that the Secretary either clarify in final regulations that institutions would be expected to comply with
SPRE standards or explain what other State standards should be adhered to. Most of these commenters also asked the
Secretary to clarify what Federal standards institutions would be expected to comply with if there were no State standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters were opposed to the proposed regulation and recommended that it be removed from the final
regulations. Most of these commenters argued that assessment of completion, placement, and licensure pass rates
is within the purview of accrediting agencies and States. Some of these commenters stated that review of such rates,
as proposed, has no bearing on the capability of an institution to administer Title IV, HEA programs. Many commenters
asserted that if the Secretary were to promulgate this regulation, the Secretary would violate the Department of
Education Organization Act as implementation of the regulation would involve the Secretary in assessing the effectiveness
of an institution's academic programs.

The Secretary notes that in commenting on other sections, such as proposed &sect;668.16(s), which deals with default
rates, commenters urged the Secretary to pay more attention to results indicators, such as completion rates, placement
rates, and the pass rate on State licensure examinations, and give relatively less credence to input indicators.
Further, both the HEA and the Student Right-to-Know Act prescribe the development and use of completion and placement
rates under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, the Secretary believes that at this juncture, it is important
for the SPREs to develop standards in these areas without reference to the establishment of standards by the Secretary.

Many commenters argued that the proposal to use a one-year Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs default
rate of 20 percent as a criterion of administrative capability went beyond the statute and Congressional intent.
Other commenters asserted that use of a single year's default rate would be unfair to institutions with small numbers
of students, and institutions with graduates who default in unusually high numbers in any given year, and recommended
use of two or three consecutive year figures to obtain a more accurate picture of an institution's loan program experience.
Another group of commenters was concerned that use of 20 percent, rather than 25 percent, as a criterion was inconsistent
not only with the statute, but at variance with other provisions for addressing defaults under the Federal Stafford
Loan and Federal SLS programs. Of those individuals and organizations that expressed concern with the use of a one-year,
20 percent figure, many recommended using 25 percent and three years of default rate data instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of commenters stated that an institution's default rates are not indicative of an institution's administrative
capability. A majority of these commenters expressed their belief that default rates are more reflective of the characteristics
of the student body served by the institution than of the institution's administrative capability and recommended
that, at the least, the final regulations provide an exemption for institutions that serve a large number of low-income
students. Other commenters argued that default rates are influenced by many factors beyond the control of institutions,
including: erroneous data, errors in calculating rates, collection practices of lenders, inadequate servicing,
regional differences, and borrowers' failure to accept responsibility. Some commenters recommended that the ratio
of borrowers to total student enrollment be taken into consideration. A few others expressed concern that there are
delays in resolution of challenges to default rates and wanted to have it clear that only final default rates would
be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters acknowledged that default rates may be one indication of lack of administrative capability, but
argued that many other factors can and do affect administrative capability.

Some suggested that it would be more appropriate for the Secretary to rely on information such as an institution's
withdrawal, completion or placement rates and pass rates on external testing and certification, in combination
with the default rate, rather than to rely on the default rate alone. Another commenter recommended assessing an institution's
default management activities in conjunction with its default rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters expressed concern that many poor students would be discriminated against if default rates
were used as an administrative capability criterion. Some commenters noted the default rate exceptions for tribally
controlled community colleges, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Navajo community colleges
and questioned why institutions other than these that serve just as many poor students should be considered poorly
operated institutions as a result of a high default rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary would like to point out that the use of default rates as a determining factor in the evaluation of an institution's
administrative capability is not new. Although some commenters perceived the proposed use of a 20 percent default
rate to be at variance with current default practices, it should be noted that the Secretary proposed use of a 20 percent
rate because that rate is currently considered as an indicator of impaired administrative capability. Furthermore,
institutions with default rates of 20 percent or more are currently required to submit default management plans.
However the Secretary also sees merit in using 25 percent as the criterion for addressing defaults under the FFEL programs,
as an institution that has a 25 percent rate for three consecutive years is subject to termination from the FFEL programs
and it is therefore consistent for the Secretary to thus provisionally certify or otherwise limit such an institution's
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Acceptance of a three year time period would also address the concern
of commenters that a one-year rate may not be an accurate indicator of an institution's administrative capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Secretary does not agree with those commenters who assert that default rates are not indicative of administrative
capability, as stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary does agree that approval of an institution to participate,
or to continue participation in, Title IV, HEA programs should not rest solely on the institution's having a default
rate below 25 percent. Therefore, if the Secretary identifies no other serious administrative capability problems
that would warrant denying participation approval to an institution with a default rate of 25 percent or more, the
Secretary intends to provisionally certify the institution. As discussed above, the limitations on full certification
will include, at minimum, the prohibition on participation in the FFEL programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that tribally controlled colleges, HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges have been treated
differently, but notes that exceptions to default provisions for these institutions were mandated by Congress.
The Secretary notes that the exception for these institutions will be extended to apply to this provision.

to specify that this standard will not apply to tribally controlled colleges HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges.

Several commenters contended that the cohort default rate used to determine an institution's administrative capability
should be the same for the Federal Perkins Loan Program as it is for the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs.
Two commenters contended that the cohort default rate should be set at 30 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan Program
to be consistent with implementation of the new cohort default rate calculation for the Federal Perkins Loan Program.
One commenter suggested that there be a ``phase-in'' of this requirement to allow institutions the opportunity to
meet the lower default rate. Two commenters recommended that the Secretary provide for an appeal procedure for Federal
Perkins Loan default rates.

In response to the Secretary's request for comment on the development of an appropriate default rate for the FDSL Program,
one commenter contended that the rate should be no lower than the cohort default rate for the Federal Stafford Loan
and Federal SLS programs. The commenter believed that if a student does not meet his or her repayment arrangements,
the student should be placed in default. A few commenters believed that a student who is using income contingent repayment
should not be considered in default and should not be removed from the cohort used to determine an institution's default
rate.

The Secretary received over eighty comments on the use and computation of withdrawal rates in the determination of
administrative capability. The majority of commenters had concerns about the calculation of withdrawal rates and
the effect of this standard on institutions serving high-risk populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal concern with the calculation was that a student who merely completed registration procedures but never
showed up for classes would be treated as a withdrawal. The commenters believed that this would result in artificially
high withdrawal rates. One commenter stated that it is not unusual to have 20 percent of the enrolled students never
start classes. These commenters recommended that only students who actually begin classes be counted. Several other
commenters urged that the calculation of withdrawal rate take into consideration the institution's refund policy.
One of these commenters said that the State of California requires a complete refund of the registration fee up to one
week after classes begin, allowing for a ``no obligation'' look. Another commenter stated that, at another institution,
students are allowed a three week ``look-see'' period during which to make sure the students are satisfied with the
training they are receiving and to allow institution personnel to make sure the student is motivated and capable of
benefiting from the training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed concern that withdrawal rates may be more indicative of the type of students being served
rather than of an institution's administrative capability. Some of these commenters asserted that use of a 33 percent
withdrawal rate as an absolute standard would result in discrimination against high-risk minority students, reducing
opportunities available to them. Commenters also asserted that this standard would adversely affect community
colleges that enroll a significantly large number of adult, nontraditional students, many of whom exit and return
to the institution several times during their academic careers, or transfer to other institutions. Another commenter
noted that institutions located near military bases, where transfers of personnel are routine, could experience
high withdrawals of students. One commenter noted that some institutions serve vocational rehabilitation and JTPA
students who are impaired to some degree, and as a result, often drop out of the programs in which they were enrolled.
Most of these commenters recommended that there be some appeal provision or mitigating circumstances exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that in addition to the student population served, withdrawal rates were a function of overall
institutional performance and the support services that are provided to students. Two commenters asked how institutions
should determine which students will succeed and which will fail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that a rate other than 33 percent be used as an administrative standard. Many commenters
noted that the proposed 33 percent rate was a stricter standard than that used by JTPA or any State, but made no mention
of what rates States are using. One commenter suggested that if there were any withdrawal rate standard, it should
be set at 40 percent, not 33 percent, as that rate would be consistent with JTPA standards. Other commenters said withdrawal
rates would be fair only if they were based on national averages, comparing similar programs in like-type institutions
or a study of some sort. Yet another commenter said there should be State-established withdrawal rates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters argued that withdrawal rates are an academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter and should not be subject to Federal regulation. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters questioned the basis for the standard. Some stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their belief that an institution's withdrawal rate has nothing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do with the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. A few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said review of withdrawal rates fell within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purview of accrediting agencies; others asserted it was no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the Secretary to review withdrawal rates as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPREs and accrediting agencies will have specific criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to completion and placement rates. Others simply said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they could see no basis for using 33 percent as a standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quite a few commenters supported the use of withdrawal rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in assessing administrative capability, albeit as an indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than an absolute. One of the commenters believed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language in current regulations was sufficient to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to make administrative capability determinations. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter supported the proposed regulation, as written. Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had no problem with the use of a 33 percent rate as an absolute, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that students who register, but never show up, are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the calculation. One other commenter said the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rate was too high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For many years, the administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations have provided for the use of withdrawal rates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of 33 percent as an indicator of impaired administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability. The Secretary notes, therefore, that the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal rates as a determining factor in the evaluation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's administrative capability is not new. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not accept the argument of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters that withdrawal rates are not an appropriate measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of administrative capability. On the contrary, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds that withdrawal rates are a clear measure of administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability as they are a function of overall institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and the information and support services that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provides to its students and prospective students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary expects that an institution that has good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions procedures and administers the ability-to-benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions properly will have a lower withdrawal rate than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which admits students who cannot benefit from the program either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they lack the academic ability or do not receive adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support services. An institution that provides proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosures, such as the institutional and financial assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information required to be provided to students and prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students under subpart D of these regulations, and in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution that advertises job placement rates as a means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attracting students, data concerning graduation and employment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and applicable State licensing requirements, as required in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement in &sect;668.14(b)(10), will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing information necessary for prospective students to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed decisions. The Secretary believes that if prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students receive adequate and accurate information, they will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop out of an institution in great numbers. Further, if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provides the financial aid counseling required in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.16(h), the Secretary expects that students are not likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraw because of a lack of understanding about the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources available to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, an institution that provides students with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive, accurate information on the institution and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, thereby enabling prospective students to make informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions about applying to the institution, screens students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately from the outset to determine that the student can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit from the program selected, and provides adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counseling to students who apply for Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance is expected to have a withdrawal rate below 33 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes further that students who withdraw may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be eligible for a refund, especially now that more stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policies have been set forth in these regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.22. Were an institution to have a high withdrawal rate, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows that an institution might experience difficulty complying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the refund requirement. By questioning the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of an institution with a high withdrawal rate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary can monitor compliance with the refund requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also believes withdrawal rates are related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rates in the FFEL and Federal Perkins loan programs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that students who withdraw are more likely to default. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealing with institutions that have high withdrawal rates, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary hopes to reduce dollars lost due to default in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that the withdrawal rate calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not include students that complete registration procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but never begin classes. Similarly, the Secretary agrees that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who receives a 100 percent refund (less any allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative fee) should not be counted for the purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter who wrote that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal rates are a function of overall institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and the support services that are provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students. The Secretary believes that transfer students, high- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk students, and students who withdraw for other reasons are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for by allowing up to 33 percent of the students to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraw from the institution.

Default rates. Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters suggested that any institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a cohort default rate above 20 percent should be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal its cohort default rate because that is the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for punitive action against an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are varying types of appeals offered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions depending on their cohort default rates. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution which has default rates above the thresholds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the FFEL programs may appeal on the grounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that: (1) The calculation of the rate was erroneous; (2) it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the criteria for exceptional mitigating circumstances; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or (3) the calculation included loans which due to improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing or collection resulted in an inaccurate or incomplete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of the cohort default rate. Institutions with cohort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defaults above 20 percent for the most recent year may challenge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculation of the rate based on allegations of improper loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing. In addition, an institution which receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification based on a default rate above 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent over a three year period also can show that it meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for exceptional mitigating circumstances and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive full certification under the appropriate regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. For further information on this provision, see the

Default management plan. Comments:

Some commenters asked the Secretary to reconsider the requirement that all institutions with cohort default rates
greater than 20 percent implement a default management plan that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the default reduction measures listed in appendix D to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters misread the regulations. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.17(b)(1) requires institutions with cohort default rates over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 percent but less than or equal to 40 percent to submit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement a default management plan that implements the measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in appendix D, but allows the institution to submit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative plan for the Secretary's consideration. Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with cohort default rates above 40 percent must implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures listed in appendix D. The Secretary believes that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter institutions obviously have failed to otherwise reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their default rates and that their future efforts need to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

excessive cohort default rates to continue to participate until

eight calendar days after the institution receives the

Secretary's notification. The Secretary has determined that it

is inappropriate to allow an institution that has high default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates above the statutory limits eight additional days to entice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students to enroll and receive loans under the FFEL programs. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution which files a timely appeal remains eligible to

Many commenters argued that the standards for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal of the loss of participation in the FFEL programs based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptional mitigating circumstances in &sect;668.17(d) are too tough. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters suggested that the completion and placement rate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary notes that section 435(a)(2)(ii) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA allows an institution to avoid the loss of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs if it shows that exceptional mitigating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances exist. The current regulations are tough but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also consistent with this statutory requirement. The HEA clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes a presumption that an institution with excessive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rates above the statutory levels is not serving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its students and that its continued participation in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs is not in the public interest. It is appropriate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution must meet tough standards to overcome this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumption. The Secretary notes that most of the commenters did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not provide any basis for changing the standard or adopting other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Therefore, the Secretary will not make any changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those requirements. The Secretary will, however, continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the exceptional mitigating circumstances standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations and determine whether future changes are

 The Secretary believes that the guaranty agency will be able to identify the loans in question with the name and social
security of the borrowers involved and that it is unnecessary to provide the guaranty date and loan type. The Secretary
notes that only Federal Stafford and Federal SLS loans are currently included in the calculation of the cohort default
rate. The Secretary also believes that it is appropriate for requests for confirmation of errors to be sent to the guaranty
agency rather than the Secretary. The guaranty agencies have the data which the institution is challenging.

 The Secretary is committed to issuing decisions on appeals from institutions within a reasonable time. Many of the
changes made to these regulations will contribute to this effort. However, the Secretary does not believe that it
is appropriate to allow an institution to avoid responsibility for its default rate because a decision is not issued
within a specified time. The Secretary also does not believe that an institution should automatically be able to escape
responsibility for its high default rate one year by delaying the completion of its appeal until the next year's lower
rate is released.

 Some commenters noted that the Secretary proposed to eliminate the provision of the regulations that required that,
in calculating the cohort default rates, the Secretary would exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or
collection would result in an inaccurate calculation of the cohort default rate. The commenters objected to this
change on the grounds that they believe that this change is contrary to Congressional intent in enacting the new law.

 The Secretary believes that it is clear that Congress intended to limit the issue of allegations of improper loan servicing
in regard to cohort default rates to appeals from the calculation of such rates. The Secretary notes that the Technical
Amendments of 1993 changed the language of sections 435(a) and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to limit consideration of improper
loan servicing allegations to appeals. Prior to the amendments, the HEA stated that improper servicing would be considered
in calculating the cohort default rate. The Technical Amendments of 1993 eliminated this language and added a new
subsection 435(a)(3) to specifically allow certain schools with high default rates to appeal those rates based on
allegations of improper loan servicing. There is no support for the commenters claim that Congress intended the Secretary
to consider allegations of improper loan servicing before rates are calculated and during the appeal process.

 The Secretary has taken and will continue to take appropriate actions to ensure that guaranty agencies provide correct
information for use in calculating cohort default rates. The Secretary has found that, during the appeal process,
institutions have not generally proven significant errors in the calculation of their cohort default rates. Thus,
the Secretary rejects the commenters' claim that the cohort default rate information is inaccurate. Moreover, the
Secretary does not agree that the courts have reached this conclusion. The commenters are referring to certain preliminary
decisions reached by courts relying on the allegations raised by individual schools. The Secretary strongly objects
to the suggestion that the cohort default rate information is inaccurate. The Secretary also does not believe that
the commenters have shown any facts that support creation of a new appeal structure. However, the Secretary believes
that the changes made by the Technical Amendments of 1993 may resolve some of the commenters' concerns.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters contended that cost substantiation is unduly burdensome. The commenters maintained that costs
differ greatly between programs, that indirect expenses such as storage, maintenance, packaging, and shipping
would be difficult to justify, and that cost per student would be difficult to calculate if supplies were bought in
bulk. The commenters argued that for large schools with many programs, the costs would change too frequently to accurately
report and many costs are determined by student choice. The commenters stated that only estimates of costs are possible.
These commenters believed that this provision should apply only to institutions with compliance problems. Two commenters
contended that the free market will determine what costs are reasonable and this provision is beyond the Secretary's
authority. Two commenters believed that this provision should be moved to &sect;668.44 (student consumer information).
Two commenters fully supported the Secretary's proposal, citing firsthand experience with institutions that attempt
to circumvent refund policies by inflating supply costs. One commenter recommended that the Secretary limit this
provision to the substantiation of only books and supplies that are required and that are institutional charges.
One commenter recommended that the provision be limited to requiring institutions to substantiate only the cost
of items that the institution supplies, not of those provided by a third-party organization. One commenter asserted
that accrediting agencies should monitor these costs.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes that cost substantiation is appropriate if the institution wishes to exclude such costs from
the refund calculation. As noted by some commenters, the free market has not worked to contain costs charged to students
for supplies because the students have little, if any, discretion on the supplies that they are required to purchase
for most programs. Furthermore, based upon the Department's experience, some institutions have historically inflated
charges for supplies that students were required to purchase. This predatory pricing for supplies has, in turn, inflated
costs borne by the Title IV, HEA programs and reduced or eliminated refunds that would otherwise have been owed to the
Title IV, HEA programs for students who withdrew. The treatment of supply charges under these regulations will help
curb this abuse without significantly changing the supply charges that can be excluded from the refund calculation
by institutions that fairly price supplies to their students.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of limiting the required cost substantiation to student charges for supplies sold by the institution or
by an affiliated or related entity, the institution is responsible for documenting the costs where a business relationship
exists between the seller and the institution. Furthermore, even if an institution purchases supplies in bulk and
takes advantage of purchasing discounts that cause the costs for such supplies to fluctuate over time, the Secretary
does not believe that it is unduly burdensome to require the institution to document its per-unit cost for the supplies
before it may exclude that amount from the refund calculation. Furthermore, the Secretary does not believe it is appropriate
for the institution to increase the documented supply costs by allocating any portion of the institution's fixed
charges to such calculation. Any such cost recovery for institutional overhead would make the calculation overly
complex, difficult to monitor, and more subject to abuse by some institutions. The procedures under the regulations
permit the institution to recover the actual cost of such supplies, but are not intended to recapture any additional
charges allocable to such items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also believes that the Department is the primary member of the triad that is responsible for monitoring
an institution's ability to comply with the requirements for prompt and accurate refund payments. Although an institution's
accrediting body or cognizant SPRE will have concerns about certain aspects of an institution's adoption and implementation
of its refund policy, HEA has given the Department the primary responsibility for establishing the requirements
for the timing, calculation and procedures for paying refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs.

 Six commenters supported the requirement for fair and equitable refunds, but suggested that to be truly equitable,
the requirement should be in force for all students, not just those who receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. Two
commenters supported the Secretary's proposal to limit these refund requirements to affect only recipients of Title
IV, HEA program assistance. Two commenters suggested refund requirements should differ among students based on
the reason for the student's withdrawal. The commenters believed students who officially withdraw for ``legitimate''
reasons, such as medical leave or a family emergency, deserve the benefit of a liberal refund policy. The commenters
believed, however, that students who withdraw without notification or whose reasons for withdrawal are ``irresponsible
or immature'' should be subject to a more stringent, less beneficial refund policy.

 As discussed in the preamble of the February 28, 1994 NPRM, several negotiators asserted that applying the refund
requirements to all students would be too costly for institutions. The Secretary acknowledges that having different
refund policies for students who received Title IV, HEA program assistance could be perceived as inequitable. However,
no institution is prohibited from adopting these refund requirements for all its students. The Secretary believes
Congress clearly intended to treat groups of students in a like manner with regard to refunds, regardless of an individual
student's reason for withdrawal. The Secretary believes a refund policy requiring the assessment of a student's
valid cause for withdrawal would be difficult to regulate and implement, and would require extensive professional
judgment on the part of the institution, thereby excessively increasing the institution's burden.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters stated that the requirement that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provide examples of an institution's refund policy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective students is burdensome and unnecessary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters asserted that most students would not understand such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples and that the examples would inevitably be misleading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the many variables that might apply to a real student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal situation would not be represented. Three commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shared the Secretary's view that prospective and current students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should receive a written statement containing an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policy, but one commenter believed providing such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement would be burdensome and costly for institutions.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that current and prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students have the right to be informed in writing of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's refund policies and practices, and that the costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of providing such information are part of the normal costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doing business. A particular student's ability to completely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehend such information does not impact that student's right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive the information. Further, the Secretary would expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in accordance with 34 CFR 668.45(a), an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have designated an employee or group of employees who must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available on a full-time basis to assist students or prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students with any questions they might have in this area. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary wishes to clarify that, as discussed in the February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28, 1994 NPRM, the requirement to provide examples would be met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the institution informs students in the written refund policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that examples are available and the institution makes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples readily available to current and prospective students on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request. The Secretary does not believe refund examples must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include all possible variables to be useful to students. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is expected to provide reasonable examples of common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund situations applicable to its average student population.

Section 668.22(a)(2) has been amended to clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must make available to students, upon request, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples of the application of the refund policy and inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students of the availability of these examples in the written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement.

Fair and equitable refund policy. Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters believed the requirement for a fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and equitable refund, as interpreted in the February 28, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM, is needlessly complex, is intrusive upon the rights of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to determine policy, and extends beyond the intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the law. The commenters believed institutions should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forced to calculate up to three separate refund amounts for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawing student, as this would be burdensome and confusing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both to institution employees and to students, resulting in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawing students inevitably receiving incorrect information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters asserted that an institution should be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine which calculation generally provides the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial refund to its average student body population and use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that calculation consistently for Title IV, HEA program refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters believed the Secretary should provide certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund calculation software for institutional use, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfairly expecting institutions to create or purchase from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private source software that is potentially erroneous. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters requested the Secretary commit to providing clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of revisions and changes to the refund requirements, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid the inevitable widespread confusion and noncompliance that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will otherwise result if the February 28, 1994 NPRM is published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a final rule. One commenter believed it is inappropriate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inefficient to require institutions to implement a policy which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affects such a small number of individuals, and that institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are capable of developing workable refund policies that are fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reasonable. One commenter supported the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation of the statute and believed withdrawing students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deserve the benefit of the largest refund possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 define a fair and equitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policy as one that provides for at least the largest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amounts provided under applicable State law, nationally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized accrediting agency requirements approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, or the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation for qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, as described in the statute. The Secretary asserts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the individual calculation of all possible refunds for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawing student is the only possible means by which an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution can determine which refund calculation provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest amount, as required by the statute. The Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploring the development by the Department of software for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional use. The Secretary believes the equity to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student provided by the law and the proposed rule override the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters' concerns of burden and potential confusion, and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to provide ample direction and guidance on refunds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions in the form of examples, Dear Colleague Letters, and

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters believed the requirements of Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A are too cumbersome and should be replaced with a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable policy. Three commenters believed the Appendix A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are intrusive and extend beyond the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute, resulting in excessive burden and cost for institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters suggested Appendix A should be a guideline for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem-free institutions, required only of institutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated compliance problems. Two commenters suggested all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions should be required to follow the guidelines of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, thereby eliminating all the other detailed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent refund requirements proposed in the February 28, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM. Four commenters asserted that institutions have already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted procedures in line with the Appendix A guidance and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further intrusion on the part of the Secretary is unnecessary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unjustifiable. The commenters believed institutions have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethical means to decide these issues among themselves and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be allowed to do so.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes the Amendments of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly give every student who receives Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance_not just those students who attend institutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance problems_the right to a fair and equitable refund as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the statute. The Secretary is concerned, as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, with instances wherein an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's State and accrediting agency do not have specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policies and a particular student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund. In such a case, a loophole exists and the law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers no alternative standard by which to ensure the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a fair and equitable refund. Consistent with existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs regulations, the Secretary intends to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A as an acceptable refund standard in the absence of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters believed the 60 percent point in time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for the purposes of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund requirement), when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in clock hours, should be calculated using the hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled instead of the proposed use of hours completed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. Two commenters specifically referred to the statute's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept of elapsed time, stating that the treatment proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the February 28, 1994 NPRM is in conflict with the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier guidance and the intent of the law. All of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believed the costs of providing education are fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each day a class is offered, regardless of an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's attendance. The commenters further suggested the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is openly discriminating against clock-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions by allowing credit-hour institutions to figure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 percent point in time using weeks, while insisting that clock-hour institutions consider individual students'
rates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress. Two commenters suggested the Secretary allow clock-hour institutions to include excused absences and
repeated hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the total hours completed by a student. One commenter noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the determination of the 60 percent point in time conflicts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the determination of the portion of the enrollment period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that remains for the purposes of calculating a refund after an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has determined that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated. This commenter believed these two determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be simple and consistent with one another.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the case of a program measured in clock hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary believes it is most reasonable to use the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours completed by the student in determining what percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enrollment period has elapsed. To determine the 60 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point by using scheduled hours could unjustifiably punish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student whose progress is slower than the average student, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could cause a first-time student whose progress is above average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund past the point of 60 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion. The Secretary acknowledges that this and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Title IV, HEA program rules differentiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between institutions based on whether programs are measured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock or credit hours, and based on whether the institutions use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard terms. The Secretary believes this differentiation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justifiable and necessary, and is due to the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive efforts to take into account the many variables and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances found in the postsecondary educational community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with past guidance issued by the Department, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excused absences may be counted when determining hours completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the student if the institution has a written excused absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy allowing for a reasonable number of absences which do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be made up to complete the program, and if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented that the hours were actually scheduled and missed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student prior to the student's withdrawal. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges that, as discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination of the 60 percent point in time is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intentionally different from the determination of the portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enrollment period that remains. The Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe consistency between these two determinations is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or beneficial.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 purposes to be in conflict with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory definition. Two commenters believed the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately defines unpaid charges and it is unnecessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to propose a different or expanded definition. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter supported the Secretary's proposal to define unpaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 purposes as it was defined for general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund purposes in the June 8, 1993 final regulations. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that the treatment of unpaid charges should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the same in all refund situations, instead of the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal which differentiates between statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations and all other calculations. This commenter believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this discriminates against certain groups of students and thus

fails to treat all students equitably.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary does not believe the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of unpaid charges is in conflict with the more general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory definition. The Secretary believes it is appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make the definition consistent with the regulatory definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already in place. The treatment of unpaid charges for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculation is prescribed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Amendments of 1992. The Secretary has in the past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently justified the treatment of unpaid charges for refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations other than statutory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters support the Secretary's proposal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid double-counting certain charges (i.e., administrative fees) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by excluding them from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtracting them. Three commenters disagreed with the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proration of all educational costs, given that some costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred by the institution are fixed (i.e., teacher salaries, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dormitory charges, and physical plant costs) and do not decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when a student withdraws. The commenters asserted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions required to issue 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds will lose money, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the students who remain will experience cost increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result. Four commenters believed an application fee should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be subtracted from a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund, because it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
really an education cost and because a portion of administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs are already recouped through the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. Two commenters asserted there is no statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support for the Secretary's proposal that an administrative fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be a real and documented charge. One commenter suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary allow all administrative fees to be subtracted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation. Three commenters believed it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrusive and inappropriate for the Secretary to regulate details 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as irregularly expended meal credits, passed-through room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, and group health insurance fees. The commenters stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such details should be handled in guidelines, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, and should ultimately be left to the discretion of

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees that it is more reasonable to completely exclude certain costs from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation, in effect allowing the institution to fully retain the money paid for those charges, rather than
include the costs and assess them at a prorated percentage, only to then completely subtract them from the refund,
thereby double-counting them. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proration of educational costs under the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is required by the Amendments of 1992 and it is not the purpose or authority of these regulations
to rescind that requirement. The Secretary agrees that an application fee is not an educational cost for Title IV,
HEA program purposes and that it is therefore not relevant in the calculation of a refund. The Secretary does not believe
that Congress intended to allow institutions to retain from a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund amount administrative charges that do not actually exist. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation determines what portion of institutional charges paid can be retained by the institution; the
Secretary believes it is unreasonable to allow the retention of a fee that was not in fact charged or paid. The statutory

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculation provides for the maximum amount of administrative costs that may be retained by the institution. The
Secretary believes certain costs (i.e., passed-through room charges, and group health insurance fees) warrant
treatment other than standard proration and has therefore specifically named such costs and proposed they be excluded
from the calculation. The Secretary believes the specific regulation of the treatment of these costs will avoid institutional
abuse of these allowances and ensure greater equity in the payment of refunds. After further consideration, the Secretary
has found the provision treating irregularly expended meal credits to be unnecessarily complex and not entirely
effective in its intended purpose. No commenters offered support for this provision or any alternative suggestions.
This issue will be reexamined in the future and further input from the financial aid community will be sought. The Secretary
recognizes that some institutions may elect to provide certain services, such as voluntary group health insurance,
as a courtesy to students. The Secretary believes it is necessary to exclude from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation mandatory charges for group health insurance to prevent students from an unavoidable loss of
insurance upon withdrawal. This situation could be avoided if the student had the option of purchasing health insurance
from a source other than the institution. The Secretary does not believe the cost of specialized insurance coverage
such as medical malpractice coverage warrants the same treatment as group health insurance costs, primarily because
such specialized insurance is no longer needed by the student after withdrawal. The statute provides that all refunds
other than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds are to be made in accordance with State or accrediting agency standards. To extend the allowable exclusion
for group health insurance fees to all refund calculations would necessitate an amendment to the law.

Changes:

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters believed the cost of equipment, books and supplies should not be prorated, because possession
of an item cannot be ``split'' between the institution and the student. The commenters believed the proposed treatment
of books and supply costs will unjustifiably enable students to keep supplies they had not fully paid for, and will
force institutions to either function as ``pawn shops'' for the return of such items or bear the costs of supplies they
do not own. The commenters believed such a policy will force institutions to raise book and supply costs for students
who remain or to stop providing supplies altogether, to the obvious detriment of continuing students. Two commenters
believed institutions will be forced to instruct students to obtain supplies from independent vendors, resulting
in great consumer risks for the student. One commenter suggested that the refund amount for equipment, book, and supply
costs should be determined by the manufacturer of the individual products and passed on from the institution to the
student accordingly. Several commenters asserted that equipment, books, and supplies become the sole property
of the student when issued, and suggested the institution be allowed to withhold delivery and billing of such items
until they are needed. The commenters also suggested the Secretary allow institutions to retain the full cost of unreturnable
items issued and of returnable items issued that are not returned, and require institutions to refund in full the cost
of any issued items that are returned and of any items that were not issued but for which the student was charged. Several
commenters stated that the return of certain supplies, books, or equipment is unrealistic and burdensome, regardless
of the condition in which it is returned, and that the regulations should therefore not require institutions to accept
returned items. One commenter supported the Secretary's proposed treatment of charges for returned equipment.

 The Amendments of 1992 require all institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs to refund unearned tuition,
fees, room and board, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and other charges 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to a student who received Title IV, HEA program assistance and failed to complete the period of enrollment for which
the student was charged. The Secretary does not believe Congress intended to exclude the unearned cost of books, supplies,
and equipment from the refund amount. However, the Secretary agrees that institutions should not be expected to refund
to the student a portion of the cost of unreturnable items that were actually issued to the student and kept by the student.
The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proposed requirements governing books, supplies, and equipment will not
force an institution to accept returned merchandise; rather, the proposed provision allows an institution to state
that an item is returnable and to then retain in full the cost of that item if it is not returned, provided the institution
clearly disclosed in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment
that is unreturnable and deadlines for returns.

 Several commenters asserted that the definition of a first-time student should be limited to a student attending
any postsecondary institution for the first time. Three commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal to include
in the first-time student definition any student who previously enrolled at the institution but received a 100 percent
refund of tuition and fees. One commenter asked the Secretary to amend the first-time student definition to include
students who previously enrolled only in continuing education courses that do not lead to a degree. One commenter
requested the Secretary to issue one consistent definition of a first-time student, instead of expecting institutions
to use different definitions for different Department requirements, such as IPEDS, refund calculations, FFEL programs
counseling, and student consumerism.

who are attending any postsecondary institution for the first time. The Secretary also believes that a student who
enrolled at an institution but received a full 100 percent refund has not had sufficient educational experience at
the institution to be considered anything other than a first-time student. The Secretary does not believe the issue
of continuing education coursework poses a serious problem with the definition of a first-time student for the purposes
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Three commenters believed the proposed definition of ``the portion of the enrollment period for which the student
was charged that remains'' is not consistent with the statutory definition of an academic year. The commenters asked
the Secretary to include in the proposed definition an explanation of the term ``week'' and describe the appropriate
handling of a student who attends only a portion of a week.

Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged. Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested alternatives to the Secretary's definition of ``period of enrollment for which the
student was charged.'' Three commenters suggested using only the length of the program, for institutions charging
by the program, or the length of the term, for institutions charging by the term. One commenter suggested the Secretary
require all institutions to use the academic year as the enrollment period. Another commenter suggested the Secretary
require all institutions to use the lesser of a payment period, the program length, or the academic year. Three commenters
believed the proposed definition does not address programs longer than an academic year. Several commenters believed
the Secretary's proposed definition is unfair to institutions charging by the program, forcing them to use the cost
of the entire program in the refund calculation, while only a portion of the financial aid awarded for the entire program
can be counted when calculating the unpaid charges. Such a formula results in excessively high unpaid charges, which
must be subtracted from the amount the institution could otherwise retain. The commenters believed this treatment
is discriminatory against institutions that charge by the program and suggested the Secretary retain the concept
of payment periods, both for assessing charges and considering aid disbursed, and limit those payment periods to
one-third an academic year (as in a quarterly term system), or one-half an academic year (as in a semester term system).
Two commenters believed the determination of the enrollment period for refund purposes should be left to the discretion
of the institution. Two commenters asked that clock-hour institutions using standard terms be treated the same as
credit-hour institutions using standard terms.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes the proposed definition of ``period of enrollment for which the student was charged'' is adequate
and applicable to the needs and circumstances of the various types of institutions participating in the Title IV,
HEA programs. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proposed definition establishes a minimum period of enrollment
(to prohibit institutions from creating artificially short periods of enrollment simply for the purposes of reducing
a student's unpaid charges or eligibility for a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation) and does not impose a maximum limit to the period of enrollment. The Secretary recognizes that
institutions charging by the program may have to pay 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refunds to a greater number of students than institutions that charge by the term and may consistently find their students
have high amounts of unpaid charges under the proposed refund calculation, resulting in a reduction in the amount
the institution can retain for non 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculations. The Secretary would like to point out, however, that such a situation exists precisely because
the institution charges the student for the entire cost of the program up-front. It is true the same student could attend
an institution which charges by the term and would, under the proposed refund calculation, owe a smaller amount of
unpaid charges. The term institution, however, does not contract with the student for any amount in excess of the costs
of the term. The adverse affects of the Secretary's proposal, therefore, as claimed by some of the commenters, are
the result of an institution's own decision to contract with the student for the costs of the entire program up-front,
instead of contracting for the costs of a smaller period of study, such as an academic term; this is an institutional
decision over which the Secretary has no control. The Secretary believes the discontinuation of the use of payment
periods and the practice of attribution will greatly simplify the refund requirements, and that this benefit overrides
the commenters' concerns. The Secretary believes it is necessary to define and limit the definition of enrollment
period to ensure equitable refunds to Title IV, HEA program recipients. The Secretary wishes to clarify that, under
the proposed definition, all clock hour institutions are treated the same, regardless of whether they use standard
terms or not, because it has been the experience of the Secretary that these institutions all charge by the program.

 refund purposes. Two commenters believed the requirement penalizes institutions by reducing the amount of institutional
charges they can retain. Three commenters asserted that the requirement unfairly leaves students owing large balances
to the institution which would otherwise have been paid by Title IV, HEA program assistance, and this result obviously
is not fair and equitable under the statute. Three commenters requested the Secretary include late disbursements
of State, private, and institutional aid as amounts that can be used to reduce a student's unpaid charges, if these
aid sources have published late disbursement policies under which a withdrawing student can be paid. Two commenters
suggested the Secretary include late disbursements of unsubsidized Stafford Loan program funds and all Direct Loan
program funds as amounts that can be used to reduce a student's unpaid charges. Two commenters believed the consideration
of late disbursements when determining unpaid charges is inappropriate and should not be allowed under the refund
requirements. One commenter suggested that, because the requirement to subtract unpaid charges from the amount
the institution can retain does not apply to statutory

 The public was previously invited to comment on requirement to subtract unpaid charges from the amount the institution
can retain in response to the December 23, 1991 NPRM. The comments and responses on this issue, including the decisions
and rationale of the Secretary, are included in the June 8, 1993 final regulations which included the requirement.
The required treatment of unpaid charges for the purposes of this section, except for the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund under the statute, reaffirms the basic principle of student financial aid: the family (or student) makes its
contribution first before financial aid is expended. Although some students may have to pay more toward institutional
charges than they originally expected, due to the fact that they withdrew and became ineligible for a portion of the
aid they expected to receive, this is more equitable to those students who have responsibly fulfilled their financial
obligations to the institution. The Secretary does not believe this issue warrants reconsideration in the context
of the February 28, 1994 NPRM. The administration of private and institutional student aid funds is not within the
control of the Secretary. Therefore, the Secretary cannot guarantee the availability or delivery of these funds
and cannot allow institutions to use late disbursements of these funds to reduce a student's unpaid charges. The Secretary
agrees, however, that institutions should be allowed to use late disbursements of State student aid to reduce a student's
unpaid charges, provided the State in question has a standard written late disbursement policy which the institution
follows in calculating unpaid charges and provided the student is eligible to receive the late disbursement in spite
of having withdrawn. The Secretary wishes to clarify that an institution which chooses to count a late disbursement
of State student aid in this manner will be liable for that amount if it is not disbursed to the student within 60 days
after the student's date of withdrawal, as defined in &sect;668.22(i)(1), and will be required to recalculate the
Title IV, HEA program refund and return any additional amounts required to the appropriate Title IV, HEA program accounts
or to the lender within the deadlines specified in &sect;688.22(g). The Secretary agrees that institutions should
be allowed to use allowable late disbursement amounts from unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and Direct Student
loans to reduce a student's unpaid charges. The Secretary does not believe the treatment of unpaid charges for the
purpose of statutory

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine
what portion of the refund must be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs. These commenters believed this change is
grossly unfair and negates the concept of equal partnership between the Federal government, the States, and the institution
in providing student financial assistance. Six commenters believed the proposed treatment will cause all parties
who contribute to a Title IV, HEA program recipient's educational costs_States, institutions, private sources
of aid_to lose their contributed funds to the Title IV, HEA programs in the event of a withdrawal. These commenters
believed these other parties will therefore be reluctant to pay any of their funds to recipients of Title IV, HEA program
assistance. These commenters asserted that such a policy would unfairly penalize State, institutional, and private
sources of aid, and Title IV, HEA program recipients. One commenter reported that State programs are already deciding
to avoid the Title IV, HEA program refund calculation by withholding their monies until after the refund period has
passed; such a practice will be detrimental to Title IV, HEA program recipients who withdraw and owe large balances
that would have been paid by State assistance, had it been disbursed on time. This commenter urged the Secretary to
prevent the negative effects of this policy by amending the definition of ``financial aid'' (for the purposes of calculating
the student's unpaid charges) to include State and private assistance that can reasonably be expected to be awarded,
even if it has not actually been received at the time of withdrawal. One commenter supported the Secretary's rationale
for removing the fraction in relation to refunds, but did not support extending that interpretation to repayments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary wishes to further clarify that the Amendments of 1992 specify in section 485 that refunds must be returned
to the Title IV, HEA programs first. Further, the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 485 of the HEA to specify
that refunds may be returned to other sources of student assistance only after the refund is returned to the Title IV,
HEA program funds in the specified order of allocation. The Secretary has no authority to alter this requirement.
The Secretary recognizes that some States, institutions, or private sources of aid may deliberately withhold funds
from otherwise eligible students who have received Title IV, HEA program assistance. This is a decision over which
the Secretary has no control. The Secretary does not believe the definition of ``financial aid'' can be amended in
the manner suggested by one commenter, as such a change would be difficult to regulate. The Secretary feels it is appropriate,
for consistency with the spirit of the law and to reduce administrative burden, to extend the interpretation of the
law to repayments as well as refunds.

 Two commenters support the Secretary's proposal to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum dollar amount below which a refund or repayment does not have to be made. One commenter suggested the Secretary
set the same minimum amount for both refunds and repayments.

 After further consideration, the Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this proposed provision is inconsistent with the amendment made to section 490 of the HEA that established criminal
penalties for failure to pay refunds, specifically including refunds of less than two hundred dollars. Further,
the Secretary believes that by the time the institution has determined the amount of the refund, most of the administrative
effort and cost has been expended. The Secretary believes that neither the institution nor the student would benefit
from the proposal to allow institutions to forgo making refunds of $25 or less. Also, the Secretary believes that part
of the institution's administrative costs are recouped through the administrative fee that is allowed to be excluded
from the

Allocation of Refunds and Overpayments. Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters support the Secretary's proposal to mandate the order of return of FFEL programs refund amounts.
One commenter supported the proposed allocation of FFEL programs refunds and believed it will reduce student indebtedness.
Three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believed including PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford loans in the refund allocation negates the basic principle
of financial aid, that the family (or student) makes its contribution first before financial aid is expended. One
commenter believed PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford loans should be excluded from the refund allocation, because
grant money should not be used to pay back student loans, especially loans that are not need-based.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary wishes to clarify that section 485 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Amendments of 1992 specifies the order of return of refunds to the various sources of aid and to the student. The
statute does not exclude the PLUS or unsubsidized Stafford loan programs from this order of return. For consistency
and reduced administrative burden, the Secretary has proposed the same order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of return for repayments as is mandated in the law for refunds. The Secretary believes the return order to be logical
and appropriate.

 Three commenters disagreed with the Secretary's assertion in the preamble of the February 28, 1994 NPRM that refunds
should not be used to eliminate outstanding balances on loans made for prior years. These commenters believed it is
in the best interest of the student to allow a refund to be applied to outstanding loans.

 The Title IV, HEA programs award financial assistance based on the costs of attendance and the student's need assessment
for a specific period of enrollment in a specific award year. The Secretary believes it is inappropriate to use funds
awarded for the current enrollment period to cover costs from a prior enrollment period.

Refund Dates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments: Four commenters believed the Secretary should be more flexible in terms of how an institution determines
and documents a student's last day of attendance in the case of unofficial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal. These commenters asserted that it is unreasonable to expect all institutions to maintain attendance
records. Two commenters suggested institutions be required to determine that a student has unofficially withdrawn
within a certain time frame, to avoid a student's unofficial withdrawal going unnoticed for an unreasonably long
period of time. One commenter believed the proposed provisions should address cases of institution-initiated retroactive
withdrawals.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary wishes to clarify that the concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the student's last recorded date of attendance for refund purposes is not ``new,'' but has been included in &sect;668.22
of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations since 1988. All institutions participating in the Title
IV, HEA programs have long been expected to have in place a system by which student attendance can be documented for
the purposes of determining the withdrawal date in cases of unofficial withdrawal. The Secretary agrees that unofficial
withdrawals should be determined within a reasonable time frame, in connection with the proposed definition of ``withdrawal
date.'' The Secretary believes cases of institution-initiated retroactive withdrawals are uncommon and as such
do not warrant regulatory inclusion.

 Section 668.22(i)(1)(ii) has been amended to limit an

institution's determination of a student's unofficial withdrawal to no later than 30 days after the expiration of
the enrollment period, the academic year, or the program, whichever is earlier.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed the Secretary should not impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a deadline for refunds and repayments. Several commenters simply stated the proposed 30-day deadline would be too
difficult to meet, especially for refunds made to lenders, and requested it be extended to 45 or 60 days. Many commenters
stated that the proposal to require refunds be made within 30 days was unreasonable, in light of the proposed 20-day
return period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, books, or supplies. These commenters believed it is unfair to allow a student a leisurely 20-day period
in which to return equipment, only to force the institution to rush the calculation and processing of a refund. Seven
commenters stated that the proposed 30-day refund deadline does not take into account the unavoidable delay in determining
unofficial withdrawals. These commenters believed most unofficial withdrawals are not discovered until the end
of the subsequent enrollment periods add-drop period, and that several institutions will therefore consistently
be unable to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day requirement. Three commenters requested that all refund deadlines_for refunds to the program accounts,
to lenders, and to students_be modified to be consistent, suggesting 60 days as a reasonable length of time for a refund
to be made.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary wishes to reiterate that, as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the preamble of the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the refund deadline given in &sect;668.22(i)(3) applies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to refunds made directly to the student. The Secretary believes refund deadlines are appropriate and necessary.
The Secretary would like to clarify that the deadlines for the return of refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs are not
``new.'' These deadlines are not included in the current Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but in the FFEL programs regulations. The Secretary wishes to clarify that &sect;668.22(g)(2)(iv) clearly states
the 30-day refund requirement given in that paragraph applies to all Title IV, HEA programs other than the Federal
Work-Study and FFEL programs. The deadline for refunds to lenders under the FFEL programs is set forth not in this section
of the student aid regulations, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 34 CFR 682.607. The Secretary believes that a 30-day refund deadline, in spite of the 20-day return period for equipment,
is reasonable and sound. The Secretary would like to clarify that &sect;668.22(g)(2)(iv) clearly states the refund
deadline is determined according to either the date the student officially withdraws 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the date the institution determines the student has unofficially withdrawn. The Secretary believes this treatment
sufficiently allows for the time needed to determine unofficial withdrawals. The Secretary believes the refund
deadline for the purposes of the FFEL programs is appropriately longer than the refund deadlines discussed in this
section of the student aid regulations and that this is necessary to account for the added procedures of returning
funds to the lender.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes the terms used in Appendix A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are standard terms of the educational community, having been in common use for several years, and as such, necessitate
no further definition.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters believed that appendix A was originally intended to address proprietary institutions and fails
to recognize or treat the specific circumstances of nonproprietary, term-based institutions. Specifically, these
commenters stated that mandatory proration of all institutional costs disregards the fact that some institutional
costs (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructor salary and physical plant costs) are fixed and unaffected by the withdrawal of a small number of students.
These commenters requested the Secretary drop appendix A and replace it with requirements that more adequately apply
to both proprietary and nonproprietary institutions.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proration of educational costs is required for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculations under the Amendments of 1992. The Secretary feels it is reasonable to extend this concept to the
Appendix A requirements, in keeping with Congress' intent to provide a fair and equitable refund to Title IV, HEA program
recipients. The Secretary notes that, in the past, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines of appendix A were applicable to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 institution, not just proprietary institutions, if neither an institution's accrediting agency nor its State had
refund standards and the institution did not choose to follow refund policies set by another association of institutions
and approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. Appendix A is intended to provide a general and stringent refund standard; the Secretary encourages institutions
and accrediting agencies to work together in developing accrediting agency refund standards which can be used instead
of appendix A standards and which can be better suited to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular needs and circumstances of individual institutions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes housing charges are separate and distinct costs from board charges, even though some institutions
voluntarily choose to link these two costs together. A housing contract prescribes charges for a dormitory or housing
space that presumably cannot be refilled past a certain point; therefore, such charges are expended at the point the
space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be refilled. Part VI provides for the refund and retention of such charges accordingly. Board charges, however,
are incrementally expended over the length of the period for which the student has been charged; the cost of food the
student has not yet consumed cannot fairly be retained by the institution. The contract concept applied to housing
charges, therefore, is inappropriate when determining the fair refund of board costs. Part VII, therefore, provides
separate and distinct guidance for the refund of board charges. For the purposes of calculating a refund under appendix
A, institutions must treat these two charges separately, in accordance with the appropriate guidelines.

 One commenter suggested adding specific language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VIII A to clarify that an administrative fee (of the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of tuition) cannot be retained
in the case of a student whose aid package consisted only of FFEL programs funds, because FFEL programs funds must be
returned in full to the lender if the student withdraws before attending one class.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commenter is correct regarding the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that FFEL programs funds be returned in full in the circumstance noted. However, the Secretary does not believe this
or other such requirements should be reiterated in appendix A. The first paragraph of appendix A clearly states that
these requirements do not affect an institution's obligation to comply with other Department of Education regulations.

 Five commenters requested the Secretary clarify the

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. Accrediting agencies assist the Secretary in determining institutional
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and should therefore be included in the list of entities that an institution
must cooperate with. A third-party servicer, acting as an agent of the institution, should be required to cooperate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any accrediting agency that accredits an institution with which the servicer contracts to administer any aspect
of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.

 One commenter was concerned that the requirement for a

noted that guaranty agencies directly compete for the services provided by other third-party servicers. The commenter
suggested limiting

cooperation to only include information that a holder of loans would be required to make available.

extent that that cooperation includes the copying of computer programs that are the sole property of the servicer.
The commenter felt that any copying would violate copyright laws included in the licensing agreement to the software;
the

 These regulations require access to a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's records to the extent necessary to monitor compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, special
arrangements, agreements, and limitations. These regulations do not require, nor does the Secretary expect, a third-party
servicer to violate any copyright laws governing computer programs. Nevertheless, a third-party servicer, like
an institution, is expected to make available for examination and copying all relevant information, including the
computer program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested amending the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;668.23(b)(3) governing reasonable access to an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel to allow an institution the basic right to protect its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest during a compliance review by having an attorney, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management representative, or a tape recorder present when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education conducts an interview with a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed by the institution. A few commenters suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions violate an employee's constitutional rights to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counsel. One commenter stated that as a minimum, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have the opportunity to build its own record and rebut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccurate charges by having tape recordings of interviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between its employees and the Department of Education's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives. Several commenters were against the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this section that require a third-party servicer, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct of audits, investigations, or program reviews, to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its individual employees_those employees connected with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs_to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned in private, without management being present or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the questioning being tape recorded. Many of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters contended that this requirement violated an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's right to due process. One commenter felt that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary was overstepping his statutory authority in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter.

The Secretary has already responded to similar

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 36682). The Secretary continues to disagree with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
views and in the three years since these regulations have been in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect has received no evidence that the claims of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are justified. With respect to third-party servicers, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions simply add requirements for third-party servicers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parallel current requirements for institutions participating in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that an institution should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to use a third-party servicer's annual compliance audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to satisfy the portion of an institution's audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for those areas that the servicer has contracted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer on behalf of the institution. These commenters noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this idea would eliminate duplication of effort by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent auditors auditing a third-party servicer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary generally agrees with commenters that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution may use a third-party servicer's audit report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover those areas of an institution's participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs that the institution has contracted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer to administer. However, if an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to have audited additional areas of its administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is required to use different procedures in having the audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed than the servicer then the institution may not be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use fully the results of the servicer's audit. An institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is always responsible for ensuring that a compliance audit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes all aspects of the institution's participation.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-three commenters suggested that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ought to be permitted to remain under the biennial audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement if that institution did not have deficiencies in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior audit report of more than five percent of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total Title IV, HEA program funds. Many of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out that this modification would parallel a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in the proposed &sect;668.15 governing financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. At a minimum, the commenters recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions be modified to reflect that an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had no deficiencies that required a monetary adjustment be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to remain under the biennial audit requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked the Secretary to clarify what are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be no deficiencies and material exceptions. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested specifying certain amounts in the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those terms. Three commenters supported the Secretary's proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide exceptions to the annual audit requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers that administer small amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program funds. One commenter argued that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers administering less than $250,000 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program funds should not be excluded from having an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual audit performed. One commenter recommended that instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of requiring third-party servicers to have performed a compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit at least every two years if the servicer administers less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than $1,000,000 in Title IV, HEA program funds, that that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold should be increased to $5,000,000. Three commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged the Secretary to require all third-party servicers to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an annual audit performed. One commenter suggested defining what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is meant by a material exception.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has reevaluated his proposal in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17 and 28, 1994, NPRMs and upon a further examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 487(c) of the HEA and information surrounding the intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the statute, has determined that the proposals were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with the requirement for an institution to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed, without exception, on an annual basis, a compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit of the institution's administration of its Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs or a third-party servicer to have performed, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions, on an annual basis, a compliance audit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's administration of any aspect of its administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary appreciates the comments and suggestions provided with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the basis for exempting institutions and third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers from the annual audit requirement. While the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot adopt these in the regulations, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering them in the development of changes to the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Education's audit guides. These changes are being designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce administrative costs by allowing institutions that meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain performance-based or funding criteria to have performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance audits under a reviewed or compiled basis rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully audited.

The provisions that provided for exceptions to the

servicers have been deleted in these final regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section has been revised to require that all institutions

have performed an annual compliance audit of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of its Title IV, HEA programs; and to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all third-party servicers have an annual compliance audit

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested amending &sect;668.23(c)(8) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish deadlines for the submission of audit reports, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than allowing the Inspector General to specify these deadlines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the audit guides. Several commenters questioned whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspector General has the authority to establish this requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without regulations. Another commenter suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations contain a provision that would require institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the deadlines specified in the audit guide, but stipulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that under no circumstances would the institution be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit its audit report earlier than four months following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the audit period.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon review of the commenters' concerns, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary agrees that because these regulations require that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit report must be submitted in a timely manner, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations should provide institutions and third-party servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the specific dates for submission of audit reports. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that a period of 120 days from the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's or servicer's fiscal year provides an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or servicer with a sufficient period of time to have an audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed and to submit the audit report to the Department.

institution or third-party servicer must submit its audit within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
120 days of the end of its fiscal year. An institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer that has an audit performed under the Single

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Many commenters were opposed to the provision that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary could require a third-party servicer to release the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of an audit to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, nationally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized accrediting agencies, and State Postsecondary Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entities on the grounds that these entities are not affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer's actions and release of information in the audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report could unnecessarily damage a third-party servicer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reputation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced entities are not affected by a third-party servicer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. The Secretary believes that by providing information- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing among the appropriate authorized entities that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary relies on to help provide oversight of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participants, that the Secretary is responding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressional intent. A third-party servicer acts as an agent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution and is responsible for administering a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's participation. As such, the various entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in program oversight will have a genuine need for access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to records of, or information about, the servicer. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore considers that the audit results of third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers must be included in the information available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate oversight bodies monitoring institutional compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Title IV, HEA requirements.

Regarding the requirement for an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain records on a student's placement if the institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a placement service used by the student, four commenters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that application of this requirement to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions for all types of student employment placement might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be overreaching and could result in institutions electing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate their student employment service rather than comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with burdensome recordkeeping requirements. Commenters pointed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out that at some large institutions, student employment centers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often act as clearinghouses for posting jobs and professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
career opportunities, but frequently lacked the resources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
track actual placement. Most often, employment information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made available to students and that information is simply removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from posting once the employer indicates the position has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filled. Commenters maintained that a formal follow-up process on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student employment is not generally systematic and obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate documentation would discourage institutions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing to provide this service to students. Two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended removing this requirement from the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other commenters suggested that the Department of Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revise this provision of the regulations so that it would apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to institutions that are otherwise required to track student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment as a condition of Title IV, HEA program eligibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertains only to those students for which the institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise maintain employment records.

The Secretary does not intend for this requirement

an institution with a placement service to document that the

educational qualifications of each regular student admitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution whether or not that student receives Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program assistance, that are relevant to the institution's

aggregate information on the educational qualifications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students admitted to the institution. This aggregate data would

demonstrate a compelling need to review the information.

The Secretary believes this provision is necessary

to establish whether an institution is in compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory admission requirements of sections 1201(a) and 481(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (c) of the HEA for purposes of institutional eligibility and

Two commenters urged the Secretary to include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that institutions retain records documenting whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and when a student completes his or her educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is needed to verify completion rates.

The Secretary has taken these comments under

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters supported the Secretary's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for a third-party servicer to notify all institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the servicer provides the same service, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those institutions under whose contract the servicer incurred a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability for a Title IV, HEA program violation. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters felt that this requirement was excessively broad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of these commenters argued that this requirement would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily damage a third-party servicer's reputation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that the Secretary's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirements were not all that different from full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification of all institutions with which the servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. One commenter suggested that third-party servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be required to notify institutions receiving the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service for which the servicer owes a liability only if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability is material. One commenter recommended that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer that is assessed a liability should have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable amount of time to provide the notification to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's clients. Another commenter was of the opinion that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary notify all of the institutions with which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer contracts of the Secretary's determination at the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time that the servicer is notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objected to the notification requirements. If a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer is assessed liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirement, any institution for which the servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the same service in which the violation was found is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially at risk as a result of the servicer's actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obviously, each institution under whose contract the servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed a violation should be notified because the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holds that institution responsible for the full amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability. In addition, each institution that contracts with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer for the same service in which the violation was found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should also be informed of the servicer's violation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that an institution that receives the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service should be informed of the servicer's violation of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program requirement because the servicer may commit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a similar violation at that institution and the institution could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be held liable for that violation. This notice will also allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution to take corrective action without waiting for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal action by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the commenter who was concerned that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers should have a reasonable amount of time in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to notify affected institutions of the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination to assess a liability against the servicer, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not believe that that time frame needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantified. Servicers are expected promptly to notify affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions of the Secretary's determination because those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are also responsible for violations committed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their servicers. Servicers that fail to notify institutions may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize an institution's ability to provide information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show that questioned expenditures were proper or take corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to mitigate violations caused by a third-party servicer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing a third-party servicer's appeal of the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, the Secretary will take into consideration whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or not the servicer notified affected institutions promptly of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree that it is necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education to provide notice to all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with which a third-party servicer contracts if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer is assessed a liability. A third-party servicer, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible agent of an institution, has an obligation to keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that institution informed of any developments that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility jeopardize the institution's participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. If the Secretary seeks to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability against an institution for a third-party servicer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct, he will provide the appropriate notice to the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.

 Four commenters opposed the provision in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that required an institution to be responsible for payment of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of the institution's participation until the amount is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid in full. One of these commenters argued that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer should be held entirely accountable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of any liabilities incurred for the servicer's violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Title IV, HEA program requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the NPRM published on February 17, 1994, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary repeatedly stated that an institution is always 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for the actions of any of its third-party servicers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This responsibility includes assuming payment of any liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred by the servicer as a result of a violation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program requirement by the servicer while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering aspects of the institution's participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. See &sect;668.25(c)(3). No institution will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be required to answer for servicer violations without the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to have such determinations reviewed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures established in these regulations.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters were concerned with the provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section governing the ability of the Secretary to perform an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative offset to collect funds owed under the procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. One of these commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary only use administrative offset to collect funds if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer has not entered into an agreement with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to repay those funds. The other commenter thought that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision amounted to the equivalent of an emergency action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without having to afford an institution or third-party servicer a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show-cause hearing. Several commenters were opposed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in this section governing the ability of the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to collect on a surety or third-party guarantee before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion of appeal proceedings. These commenters contended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this provision assumes that the party is guilty before it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proven. Two of the commenters were also opposed to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision on the grounds that audit findings of the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education are sometimes insupportable or in error and that to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect on a surety or guarantee before those findings can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proven wrong is simply improper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions in this section governing additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps that the Secretary may take to collect funds owed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures of this section are necessary to allow the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to act quickly to protect Federal funds and insure that funds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for collection. Institutions have a distinct financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive to cause delay and prolong any appeal of audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations. Some institutions use delays to either hide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets or drain assets so that none remain for collection; others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may attempt to draw increased amounts of Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds prior to any final determination. The commenters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect in stating that administrative offset denies procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Under the Department's offset regulations in 34 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 30, the Department provides written notice and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to inspect records and receive an oral hearing. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department may offset prior to completing the procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements where failure to offset may substantially prejudice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its ability to collect. In such cases, the Secretary completes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedural requirements promptly thereafter and returns any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds later found not to be owing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to comments about the Secretary's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect a surety or guarantee before final determinations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded or all appeal procedures are exhausted, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not agree with the commenters. Financial surety is provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Department as a condition of participation to insure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds are available to satisfy liabilities. The Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only attempt recourse in cases where there is a need to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief to students or borrowers affected by the actions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or third-party servicer, or where the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surety do not guarantee that funds will be available after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals are completed. For example, in the case of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that has failed to pay refunds owed to students that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attended that institution, the Secretary believes that the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to collect in advance to pay those refunds outweighs deferring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection to final determinations or until the exhaustion of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal procedures are completed.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters supported fully the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal in this section that requires a third-party servicer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume joint and several liability with an institution for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation by the servicer of any statutory or regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision relating to Title IV of the HEA. One of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters noted that only the assumption of full liability by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer could ensure the protection of public funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, many commenters supported the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some type of liability on a third-party servicer for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although most of these commenters recommended that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cap liability at the fees and compensation received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer from the institution. A few commenters supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's compromise to limit the liability of a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer to the fees and compensation received from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution if the servicer was not an affiliate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and to assess full joint and several liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the servicer if the servicer was an affiliate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. Other commenters believed in the concept of joint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and several liability for third-party servicers only to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent that it could be unequivocally proven that the servicer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the one at fault, or that the violation of a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirement was more serious than simple human error.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters opposed requiring a third-party servicer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume joint and several liability with an institution for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation by the servicer of a Title IV, HEA program requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters argued that to impose joint and several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability on a third-party servicer would (1) lead to increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing fees to compensate for increased risk assumed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer; (2) force out servicers not willing to assume a level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of risk in excess of the servicer's fees and compensation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) interfere in contractual matters that should be left to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties involved. These commenters recommended that instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing liability on a third-party servicer, to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability of the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, the Secretary should instead focus on an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability and financial responsibility to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater accountability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned what happens to existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts with institutions that were negotiated under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different assumption of liability. A few of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asked the Secretary not to impose retroactive liability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts that did not incorporate or price for such an event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary appreciates the support from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters who agreed that third-party servicers should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jointly and severally liable with an institution with which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer contracts for any violation by the servicer of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary agrees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these commenters that third-party servicer liability is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to insure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Servicers who must stand behind their work financially are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to use the high standard of care expected of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has reexamined his position with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the compromise in the NPRM to limit joint and several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability to the fees and compensation that a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer has received from the institution if the servicer was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not an affiliate of the institution. The Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that anything less than the full assumption of liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can fully protect the interest of Federal tax dollars in the form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Title IV, HEA program assistance. Otherwise, servicers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no financial incentive to insure complete program compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the comment that a third-party servicer should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be assessed liability unless it can be proven that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer is at fault, the Secretary does not consider a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer to be jointly and severally liable with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution unless the servicer is the one that has violated a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a third-party servicer violates a Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that the servicer should be held liable, along with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution with which the servicer contracts, because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, even an error, impacts on the integrity of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student financial assistance programs, and should be redressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary disagrees with the comments that requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer liability will necessarily increase fees so as to deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to servicing. Some of these commenters noted that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers may price their service at a low-level to reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that they assume no liability. The Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that institutions or federal taxpayers are well served by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers who are unwilling to stand behind the quality of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work. As agents of institutions participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs, servicers are also subject to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiduciary responsibility to use the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of care and diligence. By rejecting any responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the quality of its work, the Secretary believes any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer cannot be expected to perform with the required concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the proper expenditure of federal funds. The Secretary notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that he received favorable comments from organizations that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers, or institutions who utilize third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers, who did not raise any issue of adverse impact on fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has no doubt that these and similar servicers will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to compete effectively for institutional clients at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitive prices. The Secretary notes that the higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education servicing industry is highly competitive which should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrain any excessive fee increases; in fact, by requiring all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers to assume liability, the Secretary believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement should level the playing field by eliminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underbidding by those servicers who assume no responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quality of their work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that servicers are not being asked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve as guarantors for their client-institutions, but merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being required to answer for the consequences of their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct. In this regard, if the services they provide have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse financial impact, there is no financial exposure for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a third-party servicer, or reason to increase fees charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to those commenters who contended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability provision interfered in contractual matters that should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be left up to the parties involved, the Secretary disagrees. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary strongly believes that it is necessary to include this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in the regulations because a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administers aspects of the Title IV, HEA programs that are funded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Federal tax dollars. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish requirements to safeguard such funds. Simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaving this area to the parties, leaves open that possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no minimal care will be exercised by the servicer. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is free, however, under these regulations to agree to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indemnify a third-party servicer in the event a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer must make any payment to the Secretary. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that these regulations will have the salutary effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring institutions and servicers to exercise greater care in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the selection of their contractual partners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary would like to make clear that a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer and an institution are only jointly and severally liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any violations of any statutory or regulatory provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to Title IV of the HEA and not for other types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations. The Secretary is imposing requirements in contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between third-party servicers and institutions only to the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a third-party servicer or institution administers any aspect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the commenters who asked about the impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing contracts, the Secretary states that third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers will have no joint and several liability for periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the effective date of these regulations. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that once these regulations become effective, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts between third-party servicers and institutions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to include the requirements provided in &sect;668.25(c), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the requirement that a third-party servicer is jointly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and severally liable with the institution for any violation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer of any statutory provision of or applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory prescribed under that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory authority, and any applicable special arrangements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutes pertaining to Title IV of the HEA. This may require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of existing contracts.

 Some of the commenters questioned the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section governing a third-party servicer's responsibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report all suspected instances of fraud to the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education's Office of Inspector General. Two of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that in order to meet this requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers be given an unqualified privilege exempting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer from any liability in connection with the referral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution to the Department of Education's Office of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspector General. In addition, one of the commenter questioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's requirement to refer suspected instances of fraud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other criminal misconduct in connection with the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The commenter was concerned that if the servicer was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wrong that the servicer's reputation would be irrevocably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damaged. One commenter suggested that a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should only be required to report information indicating fraud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only where there is proof to substantiate the belief that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may have engaged in fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary recognizes that third-party servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not always be privy to sufficient information to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible fraud or criminal misconduct on the part of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. However, if there are identifiable circumstances in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a reasonable person would believe that an institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberately misreported information, recklessly reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information without regard for its accuracy, or altered official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents, then a third-party servicer should report such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the Office of Inspector General. The servicer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required to reach a firm conclusion as to the impropriety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's actions or provide evidence to substantiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible criminal charges, but is required to simply refer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter to the Department of Education's Office of Inspector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General for appropriate action. Since this referral requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a required part of any contract between a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an institution, an institution has no basis to object to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral made pursuant to this requirement. The Secretary thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that it is unnecessary to provide an unqualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
privilege as suggested by some commenters; moreover, such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
privilege would allow referrals even where there is no reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis to believe misconduct has occurred. The Secretary assures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers that a third-party servicer will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held responsible for any violations that the servicer has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself perpetrated or aided and abetted. However, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will regard failure to take appropriate action when there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable cause to believe that fraud or criminal misconduct has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred to be a serious violation of these regulations and of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant's fiduciary obligations.

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter supported the concept of the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this section governing the requirement that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must notify the Secretary within 10 days of the date that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract between an institution or third-party servicer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified or terminated or within 10 days of the date that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer, under contract with that institution, goes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of business, stops providing services, or files a petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for bankruptcy. However, the commenter believed that the burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of notifying the Secretary of any changes to the contract should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rest with the servicer. Many commenters opposed this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and argued that this requirement constituted needless paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the part of the institution. These commenters contended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any changes to a contract between a third-party servicer would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined in the course of having performed an annual audit.

One commenter recommended that the notification time frame be changed

from 10 days to 30 days. Another commenter recommended that the

time frame either be revised to state that the institution must

notify the Secretary promptly of any changes or, barring that,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 498(b)(3) of the HEA requires an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit to the Secretary with its application for participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a copy of any contract between the institution and a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer and a description of that servicer; section 487(a)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires an institution to submit information related to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability and financial responsibility. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary interprets these statutory provisions to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to keep the Secretary apprised of any contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between themselves and third-party servicers, including, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant modifications to those contracts, or any terminations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those contracts. The Secretary need contract information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by institutions to monitor the responsibilities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicers. For example, if a program review uncovers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Title IV, HEA program violation at an institution in an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a third-party servicer has recently contracted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer, the Secretary must have current information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify other institutions where the same servicer may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed the same violation. The Secretary believes that 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days constitutes a reasonable time period in which an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must inform the Secretary of any changes or terminations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract while at the same time providing the Secretary with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current information on those contracts. This time frame is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the other reporting requirements concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility under 34 CFR 600.30, thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitating reporting as an institution will not have to track 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different reporting deadlines.

 One commenter objected to the requirement that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer return all applicable records to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution if the contract between the servicer and institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is terminated, or if the servicer stops providing services, or if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer files a petition for bankruptcy. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that these records were the servicer's sole guarantee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution would pay the servicer any fees or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation still owed to the servicer by the institution. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer also argued that the absence of these records would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affect the ability of an independent auditor in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event the servicer had a compliance audit performed of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the institution's participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs.

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a third-party servicer must return records to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, these regulations do not prohibit a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer from retaining copies of the original records in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to facilitate a compliance audit. The Secretary notes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense of copying should be unnecessary as an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a third-party servicer's independent auditor with access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to records pursuant to 34 CFR 668.23(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the comment specifying that record retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was a third-party servicer's sole guarantee that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owing that servicer unpaid fees or compensation would pay, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary strongly objects to any use of Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records as bargaining chips in a pay dispute. Access to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records is required for uninterrupted administration of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. No servicer should hold these records hostage.

in this section that limited a third-party servicer's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter into a written contract with an eligible institution if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer had been limited, suspended, or terminated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but does not believe that those concerns are justified. As the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary explained in the NPRM, if a third-party servicer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to exhibit indicators of a questionable past performance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer would be prohibited from entering into a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, notwithstanding this prohibition, the Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the servicer still eligible to contract with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution if persons or entities with substantial control over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer agree to be responsible for any potential liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arising from the servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs.

 Several commenters believed that if an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation ends, it would be less disruptive to currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled students who are receiving Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance to allow the students to continue to be enrolled and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive Title IV, HEA program assistance until they complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their educational program. The commenters suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate termination of all funds under the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs would likely cause closure of the institution and costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the government resulting from forgiveness of the students' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans. A few commenters argued that if an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation has ended, it would be unrealistic to require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to inform immediately the State in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is located of its loss of participation in the NEISP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or SSIG Program, because there would be no one to make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification. The commenters suggested that it would be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for the Secretary to make the notification in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case.

Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters misunderstood that immediate termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Title IV, HEA program funds occurs for students at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution whose participation ends but that does not close. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The availability of those funds continues through the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment period or period of enrollment in which the participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends for enrolled students who have received a commitment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those funds. To provide funds beyond that point, however, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oblige the Secretary in effect to continue an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation after the institution no longer qualifies for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. With regard to the commenters' objections to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying a State upon the loss of an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the NEISP or SSIG Program, it is no more unreasonable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expect an institution to notify the State than to expect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to notify the Secretary of the loss of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any other program. Institutions have been complying with this

 Many commenters contended that if the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a notice from a SPRE that the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation should be withdrawn, the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation should not end until the institution has had the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to appeal to the Secretary or appropriate authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters believed that an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not end if the institution's program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement expires due to the Secretary's failure to approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for a renewal of participation in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that, if an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is terminated as a result of misuse of funds under the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs, the Secretary prohibit the institution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crediting to a student's account or delivering to the student the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeds of a second or subsequent disbursement of a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford or Federal SLS loan after the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs ends. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes it would be inappropriate to allow an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had previously misused funds under the Title IV, HEA program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disburse additional funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter disagreed with the requirement that, if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program ends, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must submit a letter of engagement for an audit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all funds received under that program within 45 days. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that engagement letters are not required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted auditing standards or Government auditing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards.

 Under the State Postsecondary Review Program, a SPRE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not inform the Secretary that an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be terminated until the SPRE has afforded the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its full appeal rights. A further discussion of this process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the preamble to the regulations for the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary agrees with those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters who were concerned about the expiration of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation if the review of a properly completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, submitted in a timely manner, has not been completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the expiration of participation. An explanation of the

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary appreciates the concern of the commenter that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution terminated for misuse of Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds ought not be permitted to continue to handle those funds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even for a limited period. The Secretary, however, considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the honoring of commitments made to students is equally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important and, provided that the institution continues to offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education, insists that those commitments be honored. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary can also take additional steps to safeguard these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining funds when appropriate. The institution remains liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the proper handling of Title IV, HEA program funds even after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its participation is terminated. Naturally, should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution reapply for participation in a Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or should a person with substantial control over the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also have substantial control over another institution, the way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the terminated institution complied with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section will be a factor in determining the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readmission into the programs or the person's continued role in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administration of the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary needs assurance that if an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a Title IV, HEA program ends, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will make arrangements for a final audit of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the program. A letter of engagement provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary authoritative notification that the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carrying out its responsibility to end its participation in a way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will allow the Secretary to determine whether any further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities or corrective action is required. Generally accepted

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters recommended that the Secretary expand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exception for institutions that close as a result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural disaster. They suggested that the exemption apply to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that closes as a result of fire, a weather emergency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other causes beyond the control of the institution. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that an institution that is closed or stops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing educational programs for fewer than seven instructional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days should remain a participating institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary adopts the exception for closures as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of a natural disaster because this event is readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verifiable. The Secretary acknowledges that other circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may require an institution to close on a temporary basis, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not consider these other circumstances sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish additional exceptions to the requirements of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, because the period of closure will be too short. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most such instances, the institution has recourse to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, such as the arrangement for the use of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. Indeed, the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes actually recognizes that a week of instructional time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can include a number of days in which instruction does not occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters believed that the appeal procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section should apply to institutions that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally certified if the Secretary revokes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's provisional certification. Many commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the appeal procedures of this section should apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to institutions if the institution's period of participation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expired. Several commenters suggested that the Secretary limit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspend, or terminate the eligibility of a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to contract with an institution only to those services and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs for which the servicer has been found to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in violation and only to those institutions on whose behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer committed the violation. The commenters claimed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the servicer's activities and the Secretary's sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might sometimes concern violations would have no material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship to the servicer's ability to provide other servicing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions to institutions which it serves and to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions unaffected by the original violations.

suggestion that the Secretary should limit, suspend, or terminate

the eligibility of a third-party servicer to contract with an

which the servicer has been found to be in violation and only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those institutions on whose behalf the servicer committed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation. The Secretary imposes a sanction against a

third-party servicer for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for a specific reason, to protect the integrity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary, if necessary, must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserve the right to limit, suspend, or terminate a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's eligibility to administer any aspect of the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs for any institution to ensure that further harm does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not occur to one or all of those programs. However, where

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that individual employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be responsible for actions beyond their control; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead, they should be held responsible for actions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable. For example, to be held responsible for accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors of other departments may be going beyond what is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable. Two commenters argued that the servicer is merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under contract to provide particular services, and is in no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position to monitor the institution's compliance with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary matters. They also claimed that establishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary standard also would establish enormous liability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas beyond the servicer's control. These commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that clarification is needed in the regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that a third-party servicer could only be held to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary standard for funds under that servicer's direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary holds a third-party servicer to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary standard of care and diligence only in the exercise of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer's Title IV, HEA program responsibilities that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer has contracted with the institution to perform. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not expect a third-party servicer to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for aspects of administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs or funds attributed to those programs that the servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not contracted with an institution to administer. With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the comment on the responsibility of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, the Secretary notes that these regulations apply a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of conduct only to the third-party servicer itself; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual employees are not held accountable under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision. However, the Secretary expects a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to train its employees to perform their duties consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the servicer's fiduciary obligations.

 A third-party servicer entrusted with Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds may not use those funds to compensate itself for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees owed to the servicer by an institution. As provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.18, federal funds may only be used for Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, and may not be hypothecated or used for collateral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only exception would be where an institution has agreed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay to the servicer all or part of the administrative cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance payable to an institution under the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program regulations. Otherwise, the Secretary will regard any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to take servicing fees directly from federal funds as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grave violation of a third-party servicer's fiduciary obligation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which its eligibility to contract with any institution should

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters believed that it is unreasonable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expect a third-party servicer to be held to the same fiduciary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards as the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters stated that the proposed language could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read to mean that if any employee of a third-party servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., janitor or painter) has been convicted of or has pled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
nolo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to any crime involving government funds (not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically Federal student aid), the servicer is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination. Four of these commenters voiced concern about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of due process, because the ability to screen all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants is very limited due to laws regarding privacy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiscrimination in hiring. One of the commenters stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such removal may be prevented by State or Federal laws and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps expose the servicer to liability. One commenter believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the provisions should be effective only for new contracts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because many servicers currently have contracts with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontractors that do not contain the restriction regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of an affiliation, and the servicer could be liable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breach of contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary does not agree with the comment that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer should not be held to the same fiduciary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard as an institution. As an agent of an institution, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer administers aspects of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to hold a third-party servicer to the same level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary responsibility as the institution in handling or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing the use of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with those commenters who argued that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer should not be considered to have violated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its fiduciary duty with regard to the conduct of any person, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity, or officer or employee of an entity with which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer contracts, if that person or entity does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV-related responsibilities. For example, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not hold the conduct of a custodian employed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer as an element in determining that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer has violated its fiduciary duty, if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
custodian had no responsibility for administering a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to those commenters who were concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of an agent of a third-party may violate due process or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be prohibited by Federal or State law or may be a breach of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract, the Secretary does not believe that those prohibitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist. However, the Secretary recommends that third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers modify their contract terms to specify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer is prohibited from engaging any entity to administer any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect of the Title IV, HEA programs that meets the criteria in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary expects a third-party servicer to apply these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions to existing contracts as well as to any new contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the servicer may enter. These provisions supersede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of existing contracts that the servicer may have with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside entities.

this section should be amended to exclude those instances in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the funds that were fraudulently or criminally obtained or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent were repaid. The same commenter believed that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is too broad in scope, and should be restricted only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crime and fraud involving funds covered by the contract between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution and the servicer.

 Several commenters thought that the requirements in

paragraph (d)(2) of this section were unreasonable by specifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution or third-party servicer would violate its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary responsibility if the servicer or a principal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affiliate of the servicer violated any Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. The commenters thought that the cure_to sever all

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, or to remove all responsibilities of administration of

The Secretary agrees with those commenters. An institution or third-party servicer should not be considered to have
automatically violated its fiduciary responsibility if the servicer or a principal or affiliate of that servicer
violates a Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary has recourse to apply the appropriate sanctions in this
subpart against an institution or third-party servicer if the servicer or a principal or affiliate of the servicer
commits a violation of any Title IV, HEA program requirement.

Three commenters stated that no emergency action should be taken until the servicer has been given the opportunity
to defend its actions. One of these commenters remarked that the Secretary could be subject to lawsuit if the servicer
were proved innocent. Two commenters voiced concern that emergency actions could have a severe impact on an institution
or servicer without a promulgation of evidence. One of these commenters suggested that the language be revised to
read, ``Receives verifiable information, determined by the official to be reliable *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Four
commenters felt that emergency action should only be taken when the errors are intentional or the servicer or institution
refuses to take corrective action. One commenter felt that due process mandates that the burden of proof be on the Secretary
to show cause why an emergency action is necessary, and that the burden should shift only after the Secretary has made
a prima facie case. Several commenters stated that an emergency action against a third-party servicer should not,
as a matter of law, prohibit the servicer from engaging in the administration of any aspect of an institution's participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs, but should only be limited to that aspect where emergency action is absolutely necessitated.
The commenters felt this was necessary to provide a smooth turnover of servicing responsibilities rather than a sudden
halt which could cause chaos, confusion and loss throughout the industry, including the Department of Education,
the institution, and the borrower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HEA specifies that the Secretary shall take an emergency action against a third-party servicer if the Secretary
receives information, determined by the Secretary to be reliable, that a third-party servicer under contract with
an eligible institution is violating any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to Title IV of the HEA, or any
applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation and the Secretary determines that immediate action is
necessary to prevent the misuse of Federal funds and the likelihood of loss outweighs the importance of waiting for
the final outcome of a limitation, suspension, or termination action against the servicer. An emergency action is
effective on the date that a notice and statement of the basis of the emergency action is mailed to the third-party servicer.
If a third-party servicer does not think that such action is warranted, the servicer may request a prompt show-cause
hearing. As to the concerns expressed over possible disruption, the Secretary will tailor emergency actions as he
determines necessary to protect federal interests. The Secretary also refers the reader to the discussions of emergency
actions with respect to institutions in the regulations published on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13336).

A few commenters felt that proposed &sect;&sect;668.84 (governing fine proceedings), 668.85 (governing suspension
proceedings), and 668.86 (governing limitation and termination proceedings) violate due process and privacy rights
by requiring that a third-party servicer apprise all clients of proposed actions. The commenters thought that notification
at that time is at a minimum premature if not inappropriate and would serve to create adversarial relations between
parties that should have a cooperative working relationship. Several commenters felt that fines should be imposed
only if the violation was ``willful'' or ``knowing.'' Another commenter felt that notification of a fine proceeding
against a third-party servicer should not be sent until the appeal process is completed because it could damage a third-party
servicer's reputation among unaffected parties and could unnecessarily alarm the servicer's client base. One commenter
recommended that the notice be limited to affected clients and suggested that if the Secretary does not want to eliminate
the notice at the beginning of a fine proceeding, the Secretary should be required to send a notice when the decision
to fine has been reversed.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Quite the contrary to the commenters' views that notification to a third-party servicer's clients at the initiation
of a fine or other proceeding against the servicer violates due process, this provision protects those rights. The
potential consequences to an institution if the institution's agent violates a Title IV, HEA requirement can be severe,
covering the full range of sanctions under this subpart. Thus, notice to an institution allows the institution the
opportunity to participate in the process on behalf of its agent and in its own defense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a sanction imposed against the servicer could have an adverse effect on the participation of an institution
that contracts with the servicer, including the severing or limiting of the contractual relationship. Early notice
to affected institutions permits them to judge the potential effect of the action on their participation and to prepare
accordingly. As the Secretary noted in the NPRM, early notice also allows an institution to take corrective action
before the conclusion of a proceeding under this subpart. The Secretary also corrects here two misunderstandings
of these commenters: it is the designated department official, not the third-party servicer, who provides notice
under this subpart; and the designated department official notifies only those institutions affected by the servicer's
violations, not all institutions that contract with the servicer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is sensitive to those who were concerned about how notification in the initiation of a fine proceeding
could affect a third-party servicer's reputation, but notes that information about actions the Secretary takes
with regard to violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements is publicly available and is required by section 494C
of the HEA to be shared at least with SPREs and by 34 CFR part 603 with accrediting agencies. The Secretary has provided,
in &sect;668.90, for notification to all affected institutions that contract with a third-party servicer of the
Secretary's final decision with regard to appeals under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether to impose a fine, the amount of a fine, or whether to impose any other sanction for a violation
of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, the Secretary always considers the extent to which the violation was deliberate.
The Secretary does not consider it necessary to specify that consideration in these regulations.

Several commenters suggested that in the case of a proceeding against an institution, the Secretary should notify
the third-party servicers that contract with that institution, because the functions performed by certain third-party
servicers could continue to be performed inadvertently when, in fact, the Secretary has limited, suspended, or terminated
those activities. The commenters further recommended that in the case of a suspension, limitation, or termination
against an institution the Secretary inform each third-party servicer that contracts with the institution of the
consequences of the action to the servicer. The commenters also request parallel notification provisions concerning
hearings and the submission of written material in the absence of a hearing.

The Secretary expects an institution to provide immediate notice as necessary to its employees, agents and third-party
servicers to comply with the terms of any action taken by the Department. The Secretary notes that he does not hold a
third-party servicer responsible for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements committed solely by an institution.
Therefore, the Secretary does not consider it necessary to establish provisions for the notification separately
to third-party servicers in every case.

Two commenters strongly objected to the proposal to include, as a specific basis for any of these proceedings against
an institution or a third-party servicer, a substantial misrepresentation of the institution's educational program,
financial charges, or employability of the institution's graduates by an institution or servicer under contract
with an institution, as applicable. The commenters felt that this proposal would require a third-party servicer
to monitor a client institution's marketing of its educational program, its admissions process and the appropriateness
of the financial charges as well as the statements made, verbal or written, regarding the employability of the institution's
graduates. One commenter suggested that the application of this provision be limited to third-party servicers that
provide services such as marketing for institutions. One commenter suggested that misrepresentation of eligibility
of a location be added to the violations subject to the imposition of a fine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These provisions, with respect to third-party servicers, are aimed at just such servicers as those mentioned by one
of the commenters_those that provide marketing or other services designed to represent an institution to prospective
students and the public. However, the provisions can apply equally to any other third-party servicer that, in the
conduct of its activities under a contract with an institution, deliberately misrepresents the nature of the institution's
educational program or other relevant information. These provisions do not require a third-party servicer to take
any special steps to monitor an institution's activities. The servicer being an agent of the institution is expected
simply to avoid misrepresenting the institution. Subpart F of this part describes what constitutes misrepresentation.
Misrepresentation of the eligibility of an institution's educational program clearly falls within the meaning
of the term under subpart F and further may constitute fraud under the provisions of &sect;668.83, providing a potential
basis for an emergency action. In the February 17, 1994, NPRM, the Secretary emphasized the seriousness with which
he regards misrepresentation and the potential danger that misrepresentation poses to the Title IV, HEA programs.
Commenters have not persuaded the Secretary to modify that view.

One commenter felt that the Secretary should not pursue action against a contracting institution until the matter
with the third-party servicer is resolved and also requested that the Secretary not fine both the servicer and the
institution for the same occurrence. The commenter recommended that the proposed effective date of the suspension,
limitation, or termination, which is at least 20 days after the mailing of the notice of intent, be revised to either
30 calendar days or 20 business days to allow sufficient time for preparation of a response. A commenter suggested
that a fine be imposed only for material violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary reserves the right to initiate an action against an institution at any point at which the Secretary determines
that the action is necessary. The protection of the Title IV, HEA programs requires this flexibility. Whether to impose
fines on both an institution and a third-party servicer, and the amount of those fines, for the same occurrence depends
on the degree to which each party caused or is otherwise responsible for the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers 20 days generally to be sufficient time for the notified party to prepare a response. The Secretary
notes, however, that this provision establishes a minimum time frame. The Secretary may allow additional time if
the Secretary determines that the circumstances of the proceeding require more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not consider it advisable to restrict the imposition of fines to material violations of Title IV,
HEA program requirements. However, &sect;668.92 describes generally the factors that the Secretary may consider
in determining the amount of a fine.

Several commenters questioned the absence of criteria in the regulations for the qualification of the hearing officer.
The commenters also suggested that procedures should be established to allow for the participants to inform the hearing
officer of details of the issues given the generally complex issues involved in most cases. The commenters recommended
that the Secretary be required to provide a copy of the transcript described in &sect;668.88(d) to all parties within
ten days of the hearing. Several commenters felt that any decision should be governed by a ``reasonableness'' standard
to limit the liabilities of parties participating or providing servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs in good faith.
The commenters thought that the process should allow for extenuating circumstances and that the hearing official
should have the authority to interpret regulations and to rule them inapplicable. Another commenter believed that
the hearing official should be bound by not only all applicable statutes and regulations but also other guidance deemed
to be in effect by the Secretary to ensure that ``Dear Colleague'' letters and other written guidance from the Department
of Education be included. One commenter believed that any prehearing conference with a third-party servicer should
include any institution that has a contract with that servicer and who could potentially be affected by the Secretary's
action. One commenter suggested that &sect;668.89 be modified to require that the hearing official be bound not only
by ``all applicable statutes and regulations'' but also by all applicable judicial precedent, the Constitution,
Federal statutes of general applicability, including the United States Bankruptcy Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned the statement that if the hearing officer finds that a termination is warranted, the Secretary
affirms that decision asking if the Secretary intends to automatically affirm the hearing official's decision.
A few commenters suggested that an institution or third-party servicer should be able to introduce new evidence on
appeal noting that the Secretary should have the opportunity to have complete information that may not have been presented
at the original fact-finding sessions. These commenters thought that the emphasis in resolving the issue should
be on arriving at the most fair and most logical conclusion as opposed to conforming to a stringent pattern or process.
One commenter felt that the Secretary should not have a special process for fraud investigations and there should
not be limitations placed on a hearing official's ability to act. The commenter believed that the proposed procedures
would unfairly limit the due process procedures available to participants in the system and that the current procedures
do not require further modification.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has considered the suggestions from the commenters that some minimum standards be set out in the regulations
to establish qualifications for the hearing officer, but does not believe that any such actions are appropriate.
The hearing official is charged with the responsibility of resolving the issues requested in the appeal, and the parties
bear the responsibility of presenting the issues in controversy. The hearing official meets requirements for experience
and capability in accordance with internal Department procedures, and no additional requirements are needed in
these regulations. Additionally, the hearing official's decisions involving limitations, suspensions, terminations
and fines may be appealed to the Secretary under this subpart. This appeal to the Secretary provides an additional
procedural safeguard that the issue will be resolved fairly in a manner that is consistent with other decisions issued
by the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that additional regulations are necessary to permit the participants
to inform the hearing officer of details of the issues due to the generally complex issues involved in some cases. Under
the regulations, any party may request a prehearing conference that would address how the parties could present the
relevant issues to the hearing official. In addition, the parties have the opportunity to make their position known
in the pleadings required by the hearing official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution or third-party servicer who is the respondent in an administrative
hearing should be provided with a copy of a transcript when one is prepared by the Department of Education. Under current
procedures, a transcription is routinely made of any adverse action initiated under this subpart, and a copy of the
transcript is provided to the respondent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary disagrees with the suggestion that the regulations establish a ``reasonableness'' standard to limit
the liabilities of parties participating or providing servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs in good faith. Institutions
and third-party servicers are fiduciaries that are entrusted with properly administering the Title IV, HEA programs.
Establishing a lesser negligence is inappropriate, particularly given the advance system of Title IV, HEA funding
used by the overwhelming majority of participating institutions. As fiduciaries, these parties are held to one of
the highest standards of accountability, and it is inappropriate to excuse or reduce a liability that is caused by
a subjective good faith belief purportedly held by the institution or third-party servicer. Business decisions
that concern the degree of care and oversight required by institutions and third-party servicers must take into consideration
their responsibility for adhering to the applicable program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also rejects any suggestion that the hearing official be given discretion to refuse to apply applicable
regulations to a dispute. The regulations constitute final determinations by the Secretary concerning the requirements
that must be followed by institutions and third-party servicers to participate in the HEA programs. The hearing official
must apply the regulations as written. This process provides certainty to all parties, and enables the development
and enforcement of a consistent body of administrative rulings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary appreciates the suggestion of commenters who urged that guidance issued by the Department in the form
of manuals, handbooks, other publications or Dear Colleague letters should be binding the hearing official in the
same manner as regulations. However, such guidance does not have the same legal force as regulations issued pursuant
to formal rulemaking. The Secretary believes that such guidance does provide a foundation against which the reasonableness
of the institution's or third-party servicer's conduct may be judged. In the context of resolving whether the institution
or third-party servicer violated a regulation or statute, or breached its fiduciary duties, the hearing official
should evaluate the institution's or third-party servicer's actions based upon whether it made a good faith effort
to apply and follow the guidance issued by the Department. The Secretary believes that actions taken contrary to such
guidance would be presumptively improper and should be viewed as such by a hearing official. The Secretary further
believes it will be a rare instance where a party can demonstrate that it fulfilled its fiduciary obligation and complied
with statutory or regulatory requirements while failing to heed or apply guidance issued by the Department of Education
as to the proper application of statutory or regulatory provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree that it is necessary to list all possible authority binding on the hearing official. The
parties are free to cite any authority they feel may govern a particular case or issue. Section 668.89(d) is included
to preclude hearing official from ignoring or refusing to apply departmental statutes and regulations. If a hearing
otherwise fails to apply applicable authority, a party may appeal to the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree that an adverse action initiated against a third-party servicer must necessarily include
any institution that has a contract with that servicer who could potentially be affected by the Secretary's action.
The particular facts in each case will determine the party or parties against whom an adverse action is taken, and in
some instances it may be appropriate for an institution and its servicer to both be named as respondents. In some cases,
a third-party servicer against whom an adverse action is initiated may ask the Department to expand the administrative
action to encompass the institutions that are relevant to the administrative action. Again, the Secretary believes
that the particular facts of each case will have to be considered to determine the appropriate actions, rather than
expanding the scope of the regulations to require such participation by other parties in every case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also suggested that such participation by a third-party servicer's customers should be considered
because an adverse ruling would have an impact on every other client for that servicer, especially where a termination
or debarment action were sought. However, the resulting impact of a termination or a debarment of a third-party servicer
on the servicer's customers is not a sufficient basis for these parties to be given a right to be represented in any prehearing
conference. To invite all potentially affected parties to the hearing would complicate the proceedings. The proper
focus of the administrative proceeding is determining whether the limitation, termination, or suspension should
be imposed based upon the cited program violations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has modified the proposed regulation to provide that any initial decision by a hearing official that
is appealed to the Secretary may be affirmed, reversed, remanded to the hearing official, or modified. The Secretary
also notes that the regulations require a hearing official to uphold certain adverse actions when specific findings
are made as set out in &sect;668.90. Although the Secretary reserves the discretion to review such rulings on appeal,
these administrative decisions already reflect the Secretary's judgment that such action is appropriate under
those facts, and modification of any such ruling will be rare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary disagrees with the suggestion that an institution or third-party servicer should be able to introduce
new evidence on appeal. The administrative process requires that the relevant information necessary for the decision
will be presented to the hearing official within the time limits set out in the regulations. Any appeal to the Secretary
must be based solely upon that information already in the administrative record and upon items which may be judicially
noticed. Any subsequent opportunity to introduce new evidence on appeal would deprive the hearing official of the
opportunity to have issued a decision based upon a complete record, and could discourage a respondent from placing
its complete case before the hearing official at the appropriate time. This system of resolution is fairer and more
efficient because it provides each party with an opportunity to have their complete case heard by a hearing official

The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to include fraud as a finding in &sect;668.90 for which an adverse action
must be upheld where the hearing official makes a determination that the underlying activity has occurred. This addition
to the regulation reelects the Secretary's determination that any fraud committed by an institution or third-party
servicer is serious enough to warrant the imposition of the adverse action sought. In such instances, and consistent
with the other items that have been placed into this category in the past such as missed audit submissions, it is appropriate
to limit the discretion of the hearing official in accordance with the Secretary's determination that this category
of finding warrants the adverse action initiated by the designated Department official. Furthermore, the regulation
provides certainty to all parties concerning the gravity of the underlying violation, while providing an institution
or third-party servicer an opportunity to request an administrative appeal to a hearing official concerning whether
the respondent committed fraud.

A number of commenters responded to the Secretary's request for comment and agreed that repeated mechanical systemic
unintentional errors should be treated as a single violation for purposes of assessing a fine against a third-party
servicer. However, one commenter argued that total compensation for the value of the error should be expected. Another
commenter suggested that the Secretary should address cases in which the third-party servicer deliberately failed
to implement a regulation or failed to institute programming corrections relating to previously cited findings
identified by an auditor, client, or the Secretary. The commenter believes that in these situations the fines should
be significant based upon the risk of loss due to the servicer's negligence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters felt that it would be inappropriate to adjust the amount of a fine simply based upon the size of the
institution or servicer, claiming that a small organization should not benefit and a large organization should not
be penalized solely on their size. One commenter suggested that the purpose of considering the size of the servicer's
business was to take into consideration the dollar value of the violation in comparison to the overall value of the
contracts being serviced by the servicer and suggested that language be added concerning the assessment of materiality
of the violation. A few commenters supported a position that the determination of the size of any fine take into account
the extensiveness and gravity of the violation and should be assessed in direct correlation to any loss of funds. The
commenters also felt that the fines should only be assessed against the party who was directly responsible for the
violation and supported the provision that the servicer may provide evidence that the institution contributed to
the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that any references to special arrangements should be deleted and noted that performing any statutory
and regulatory requirement should cover all applicable situations.

The Secretary agrees with the commenter who suggested that, in determining the amount of the fine to be assessed against
a third-party servicer for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional
error need not be counted as a single violation if the servicer had been previously cited for this type of error and had
failed to implement corrections. With respect to the commenter who suggested that in determining the amount of a fine
with respect to a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error, that the amount of the fine should at least be
equal to the total value caused by the error, the Secretary does not agree with that comment. However, the Secretary
does agree that the determination of the amount of the fine should take into consideration the amount of Title IV, HEA
program funds that were lost due to the error.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the concerns expressed about the relationship of the amount of a fine to the size of an institution or
of a third-party servicer's business, the Secretary points out that the size of an institution or business has a bearing
on whether the institution or servicer has overextended its capability of properly administering the Title IV, HEA
programs and the extent to which harm has been done to the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the commenter who thought that the phrase special arrangement should be deleted from this section,
the Secretary does not agree with that commenter. Special arrangements are based on individual circumstance and
therefore should be taken into consideration. However, as noted elsewhere in the comments and discussion section,
the Secretary clarifies special arrangements to refer to those special arrangements entered into under the authority
of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA.

 Paragraph (a)(5) is revised to specify that as one of the criteria in determining the extent to which violations are
caused by a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error, the total number of violations is considered to be
a single violation, provided the third-party servicer has not previously been cited for this type of error and had
failed to make the appropriate corrections to the system where the violation originated. In determining the amount
of a fine, the Secretary also takes into consideration, as applicable, the financial loss to the Title IV, HEA programs
that was attributable to the repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended that the regulations be amended to terminate the eligibility to perform some but not all
of the services provided by the third-party servicer, claiming that some functions provided by the servicer may continue
to meet the applicable requirements of the program. This change would recognize that a third-party servicer may provide
multiple and unrelated functions under the Title IV, HEA programs. Many commenters expressed concern about the provision
in &sect;668.94(c) requiring the servicer to return to each institution that contracts with the servicer all records
pertaining to the servicer's administration of that program on behalf of that institution. One commenter suggested
that since the institution may contract with another servicing entity, the records should be passed to the new servicer
as specified by the institution. Many commenters pointed out that the records maintained by the third-party servicer
appear on microfiche, imaging disc, microfilm, or in paper form and the servicer will be able to provide copies of such
records but not the original records. One commenter suggested an expansion to require the servicer to return servicer
notes, related documents, records or copies of such notes, related documents and records that pertain to the servicer's
administration of the program on behalf of the institution. The commenter further suggested that the servicer certify
copies as exact copies whenever required by law. The commenter also suggested that a sentence be added to protect the
proprietary rights of the servicer to data base media, servicing procedures, computer programs, software packages,
servicer forms, and other proprietary information, procedures and materials. Another commenter noted that copies
of records for a single institution's loans may be commingled with records pertaining to other institutions and suggested
that servicers should be permitted to provide records upon request rather than all at once.

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that it may be appropriate to terminate the eligibility of a third-party
servicer to perform some but not all of the activities under certain circumstances. In other situations, however,
a violation may be so egregious that complete termination from being able to administer any aspect of the institution's
participation is appropriate. The Secretary believes that the regulations provide the needed flexibility to determine
the correct action to be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records relating to a third-party servicer's administration of any aspect of an institution's participation in
the Title IV, HEA programs are the institution's property. A third-party servicer may make copies of the original
records that it provides to an institution if the contract between the servicer and institution is terminated. See
the discussion in &sect;668.25 on records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not agree that the regulations need to be expanded to cover servicer notes, related documents,
records, or copies of such notes; that is a matter between the institution and the servicer. The Secretary does not
believe that it is necessary to add regulatory language to protect the proprietary rights of the servicer since adequate
protection already exists through copyright laws to serve this purpose.

 Several commenters recommended that the reference to third-party servicer in &sect;668.95(c) be removed because
the servicer generally makes no claims for benefits on its own behalf therefore funds would not be available to be offset.
Another commenter noted that if the Secretary is transmitting funds directly to a third-party servicer on behalf
of institutions, the funds are for multiple institutions and to offset an unaffected institution's funds would not
be reasonable or fair. One commenter requested that the provision in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that would
have the servicer or institution repay any discounts, premiums, or excess interest paid under 34 CFR part 682 be eliminated
stating that the payment of premiums and discounts are contract issues between two lenders in the FFEL programs and
should not be assessed to other parties or repaid to the Secretary.

 The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who recommended removing reference to a third-party servicer from
the provision governing the ability of the Secretary to offset any benefits or claims due to an institution or third-party
servicer against any payment that an institution or third-party servicer may owe to the Secretary. A situation may
arise where a third-party servicer makes a claim against the Department of Education for funds owed to the servicer
and the Secretary wants to offset that claim because the servicer has not repaid a liability owed the Department of
Education for a violation of the Title IV, HEA program requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also does not accept the comment that paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section should be removed. This provision

 Several commenters suggested that with respect to a third-party servicer's request for review, the hearing official
only notify the institutions to whom the findings were originally disclosed since a third-party servicer may have
added new clients during the period between the publication of the findings and the announcement of the hearing and
the new clients would not be aware of the findings and could be confused by the notice of the hearing. Another commenter
felt only institutions that contract with the servicer of the affected functions should be notified.

 Several commenters recommended that an institution or third-party servicer also have the burden of proving that
the findings are not substantial in nature. The commenters felt that some findings or alleged violations may be irrefutable,
but their effect may be strictly limited, posing immaterial impact on the integrity of the servicer's or lender's
portfolio. One commenter felt that a third-party servicer should only have the burden of proving that the ``expenditures
questioned or disallowed were proper'' to the extent that the servicer contracts with the institution for cash management
of Title IV, HEA program funds and that the Secretary should not question servicing fee income since it is not considered
Title, IV HEA program funds. A few commenters suggested deleting references to the time frames within which an institution
must have provided documentation previously stating that any legitimate documentation regarding the subject at
issue should be admissible and the time frames within which it was previously submitted are irrelevant to their authenticity
or material relationship to the case. Several commenters felt that the transcribed records of the proceeding should
only be made available to the hearing participants and not to any institution that contracts with the servicer.

 With respect to the suggestion that an institution or third-party servicer need only prove that findings are ``not
substantial,'' the Secretary disagrees that the standard for accountability for Federal funds should be relaxed.
An institution, or its third-party servicer, is a fiduciary and duty bound to use the highest standard of care and diligence
at all times in the administration of the Title IV HEA programs. The suggested language would weaken this standard.
If, as suggested by the commenters, a violation truly has an immaterial impact, then there will no significant liabilities
assessed.

With respect to the comments on altering the time periods for submission of documentation by institutions, the Secretary
notes that the purpose of this rulemaking it to make existing regulations applicable to third-party servicers and
not to extensively modify the hearing procedures. The Secretary believes that the present procedures are consistent
with an institution's record-keeping and fiduciary obligations; institution's complying with these obligations
should have, and have had, no difficulty in meeting established deadlines. Further, requiring submission of documentation
with a request for review allows cases to be resolved without hearing.

 The Secretary understands the commenters concerns that the copy of a third-party servicer's contract with a guaranty
agency contains proprietary information that the servicer does not wish to be made public. Many of the commenters
were concerned that a copy of a third-party servicer's contract would be released under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). The Secretary wishes to assure third-party servicers that trade secrets and confidential commercial
or financial information is not releasable under FOIA. Parties concerned over possible release should, however,
take appropriate precautions by marking submitted contracts as confidential. This provision is intended only to
facilitate oversight and make the Secretary aware of all the services the third-party servicer has contracted to
provide. Although many commenters believed that a third-party servicer could accomplish this by summarizing the
services it has contracted to provide. In order to verify this information, the Secretary would need a copy of the actual
contract. Therefore, the Secretary has decided to retain this requirement in the final rule.

 Several commenters objected to a third-party servicer being held jointly and severally liable for any interest benefits
and special allowance its client received on its FFELP loan portfolio when the servicer may not have been responsible
for billing the Department for such monies. Some commenters believed that clarification to this provision is necessary

Discussion:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a third-party servicer should not be held responsible for any program
violations it did not commit. The regulations do not hold a third-party servicer jointly or severally liable for any
interest benefits or special allowance received by a lender for which the lender was not eligible if that servicer
complied with program regulations. However, a third-party servicer that is not responsible for billing the Department
for interest benefits and special allowance may be responsible for the lender receiving interest benefits and special
allowance for which the lender is not eligible because the servicer has violated other program requirements. The
Secretary believes that a third-party servicer should be responsible for its actions and that holding a third-party
servicer potentially liable for Federal monies expended because it has committed program violations helps accomplish
this. The Secretary also believes that holding lenders and servicers jointly and severally liable is the best way
to protect the Federal fiscal interest. See prior discussion on this issue under &sect;668.25 and in the February
17, 1994 NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is sensitive that this provision makes a significant change in how responsibility for liabilities
may be covered in contracts that servicers enter with lenders. Therefore, the Secretary has established an order
in which he will attempt to collect such liabilities. The Secretary will first attempt to collect such liabilities
from the lender and, if necessary, offset the lender's first future claim to the Secretary for interest benefits and
special allowance for the amount of the liability. The Secretary believes that this is the most effective and efficient
means to collect a liability and that he will be successful in collecting from the lender in most cases. However, the
situation may arise when the Secretary is not able to collect these monies from a lender because the lender chooses
not to submit further claims, discontinues its participation in the FFEL programs, or becomes insolvent and is taken
over by banking regulators. Because such circumstances may arise, the Secretary retains the option of holding a third-party
servicer jointly and severally liable with a lender for such liabilities. However, the Secretary intends to exercise
his authority to collect a liability from a third-party servicer under this provision only when he is unable to collect
such monies from the lender.

Many commenters suggested that the liability of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer acting as an agent for a guaranty agency be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed because the commenters believed that the servicer does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not play a role under this provision that would subject it a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability.

The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer that is administering any aspect of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency's FFEL programs may be responsible for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency paying a claim that is not eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinsurance. This situation may occur when the servicer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negligent in reviewing the history of the loans consolidated in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Consolidation loan under 34 CFR 682.206(f) when a default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim is submitted that results in the agency subsequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving reinsurance on such a claim. This would result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability being created by the servicer's actions.

Many commenters suggested that the Secretary qualify

the term business systems so that it was clear that such systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included combined automatic and manual systems. The commenters

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters believed that the financial standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary was proposing for an institution should not be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for third-party servicers because a third-party servicer in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs has different financial obligations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities than an institution. Many commenters believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any requirements related exclusively to functions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required by FFEL programs servicers should be deleted, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as deferred tuition accounts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters in that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer should not be held responsible for meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial standards that are unrelated to the functions which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not responsible to perform. The Secretary does not intend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a third-party servicer that is administering aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL programs on behalf of a lender or guaranty agency to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet financial standards with respect to items that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unrelated its contractual obligations with the lender or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency. The Secretary does not agree with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters that a third-party servicer should not otherwise meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial standards that are similar to those an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet. The Secretary believes that it was the intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Congress to ensure that the FFEL programs are protected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any risk that may involve the servicer's financial status, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons responsible for administering or controlling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, or the servicer's performance. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has decided to require a third-party servicer to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for financial responsibility similar to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required of institutions of higher education.

servicer contracts. The commenters suggested that only persons,

third-party servicer contracts that act in a capacity that

The Secretary believes that when the servicer's actions are

when continued participation of an entity in the FFEL programs

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters believed that &sect;690.83(e) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations does not comply with the statute because, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing section 487(c)(7) of the HEA, it places undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions on an institution seeking additional funds which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would have been eligible to receive if it had met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Pell Grant Program reporting deadlines. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the Secretary had unduly limited the scope of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
487(c)(7) of the HEA by making the provision of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable only to funds received under the Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that the proposed rule in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;690.83(e) is in accordance with the program statute. When an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's auditor identifies underreported Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures beyond the normal reporting and reconciliation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadlines for the Federal Pell Grant Program, &sect;690.83(e) provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a mechanism for an institution to receive credit for having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly expended those funds. Congress intended that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution have such a mechanism available. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not believe that Congress intended for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting recaptures of properly expended funds to continue in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perpetuity. In order for the Department to complete its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting for the Federal Pell Grant Program appropriations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are expected to timely reconcile the expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the award year, with a final accounting made on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before September 30. The procedures in &sect;690.83(e) will provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further opportunity for an institution to seek credit for having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly expended these funds during a prior award year, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is appropriate to limit the circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and timing for receiving credit for such prior expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, &sect;690.83(e) is limited to the Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program because the auditing procedure permitted under &sect;690.83(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in an adjustment to the institution's prior year funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization for the Federal Pell Grant Program. There is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponding capability to adjust prior year funding for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Title IV, HEA programs.

requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's computation of the annual public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping burden in the regulations is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate based on the best information available. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified sections of the regulations containing information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements in the preamble to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and complied with all applicable requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing regulations in 5 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 1320. The Department appreciates the additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by commenters regarding the estimated burden. To the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent that commenters identified specific regulatory provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as imposing burdens or provided estimates of the amount of burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed, this information has been considered in developing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations. The Department did not consider students in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing the estimated burden of the information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the regulations because the regulations govern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary institutions participating in the Title IV student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance programs. If any burden is imposed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, it is indirect and not subject to computation under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act. As a result of the comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions to the regulations, the Department is modifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden estimates. The total annual reporting and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden that would result from the collection of the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is 123,485 burden hours for the package.

In the NPRMs, the Secretary certified that the

proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities. Several commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that this statement was erroneous and that these rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will definitely have a significant impact on institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially the smaller ones that are not computerized.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that the regulations will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an impact on small institutions. However, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department estimates of the impact, the Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that the impact will be disproportionately or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically significant. The Secretary therefore reaffirms his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification that the regulations would not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact or a substantial significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. To the extent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters are able to provide additional information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact of the regulations, the Secretary invites the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters to submit this information so that it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that the student borrow additional funds for which

interest or other charges are assessed, on any student because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's inability to meet his or her financial obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) A statement by the accountant expressing substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(A) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an acid test ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the acid test ratio shall be calculated by adding cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sum by total current liabilities. The calculation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related party receivables. Should application of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(5) of this section cause a portion of the institution's cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves to be classified as a noncurrent asset, those cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves may be included in cash equivalents in calculating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's acid test ratio; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Has not had operating losses over both of its 2 latest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years that result in a decrease in tangible net worth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of 10 percent of the institution's tangible net worth at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beginning of the first year of the 2-year period. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may calculate any operating loss for an institution by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding from net income: extraordinary gains or losses; income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or losses from discontinued operations; prior period adjustment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this section, the calculation of tangible net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth. In applying this standard, a positive tangible net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth occurs when the institution's tangible assets exceed its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth shall exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all assets classified as intangible in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or above the second highest rating level of credit quality given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) For a nonprofit institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(A) Prepares a classified statement of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles or provides the required information in notes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audited financial statements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid test ratio of at least 1:1. The acid test ratio shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. The calculation of the acid test ratio shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized related party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receivables. Should application of paragraph (b)(5) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as a non-current asset, those cash reserves may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in cash equivalents in calculating the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid test ratio; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

) Has, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary may include funds that are temporarily restricted

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution is not required to meet the

(i) Is located in, and is legally authorized to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within, a State that has a tuition recovery fund that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible under paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(6) through (9) of this section, if the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

including the ability to meet all of its financial obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

audited financial statement was requested by the Secretary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

assets, before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, unless the institution demonstrates that the decreased net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income shown on the current financial statement is a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downsizing pursuant to a management-approved business plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Loans and other advances to related parties have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased from the prior fiscal year unless such increases were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured and collateralized, and do not exceed 10 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior fiscal year's working capital of the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The institution has not materially leveraged its assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or income by becoming a guarantor on any new loan or obligation

on behalf of any related party;

parties are current, and that the institution has demanded and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving payment of all funds owed from related parties that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable upon demand. For purposes of this section, a person does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not become a related party by attending an institution as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There have been no material findings in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's latest compliance audit of its administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV HEA programs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) There are no pending administrative or legal actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being taken against the institution by the Secretary, any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agency, the institution's nationally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency, or any State entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An institution is not required to meet the acid test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio in paragraph (b)(7)(i)(A) or (b)(8)(i)(B) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the institution is an institution that provides a 2-year or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4-year educational program for which the institution awards an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of the Secretary that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There is no reasonable doubt as to its continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It is current in its payment of all current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding taxes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) It has substantial equity in institution-occupied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to meet the acid test ratio requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Secretary may determine an institution to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible even if the institution is not otherwise

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The institution notifies the Secretary, in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 34 CFR 600.30, that the person referenced in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) of this section exercises substantial control over the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Secretary determines whether an institution is financially responsible under this section by evaluating
documents submitted by the institution and information obtained from other sources, including outside sources
of credit information. To enable the Secretary to make this determination, the institution shall submit to the Secretary
for its two latest complete fiscal years, a set of financial statements of the institution, prepared on an accrual
basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited by an independent certified public
accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The Secretary may also require the institution
to submit or otherwise make available, the accountant's work papers. If an institution submits audited consolidated
financial statements of its parent corporation for the Secretary to use in determining the institution's level of
financial responsibility, the consolidated financial statements must be supplemented with consolidating schedules
showing the consolidation of each of the parent corporation's subsidiaries and divisions (each separate institution
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs must be shown separately), intercompany eliminating entries, and derived
consolidated totals. The Secretary may also require the institution to submit additional substantive information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An institution shall submit the documents required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section annually within four months
after the end of the institution's fiscal year, unless the Secretary requests a more frequent submission. Upon a showing
of good cause, the Secretary may grant a filing extension to an institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary considers the audit submission requirement of this section to be satisfied by an audit conducted
in accordance with_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Single Audit Act (Chapter 75 of title 31, United States Code); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary
that the institution is capable of adequately administering that program under each of the standards established
in this section. The Secretary considers an institution to have that administrative capability if the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with all statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV
of the HEA, all applicable regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory authority, and all applicable
special arrangements, agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title
IV of the HEA;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which
it participates and for coordinating those programs with the institution's other Federal and non-Federal programs
of student financial assistance. The Secretary considers an individual to be ``capable'' under this paragraph if
the individual is certified by the State in which the institution is located, if the State requires certification
of financial aid administrators. The Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an individual
is capable, including, but not limited to, the individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program training
provided or approved by the Secretary, and previous experience and documented success in administering the Title
IV, HEA programs properly;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

standards to be reasonable if the standards_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Conform with the standards of satisfactory progress of the nationally recognized accrediting agency that accredits
or preaccredits the institution, if the institution is accredited or preaccredited, and if the agency has those standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For a student enrolled in an eligible program who is to receive assistance under a Title IV, HEA program, are the
same as or stricter than the institution's standards for a student enrolled in the same educational program who is
not receiving assistance under a Title IV, HEA program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Grades, work projects completed, or comparable factors that are measurable against a norm.

(C) Divided into increments of equal size, not to exceed the lesser of one academic year or one-half the published length
of the educational program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

reviews_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents,

Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of each applicant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any documents, including any copies of State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal income tax returns, that are normally collected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to verify information received from the student or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other sources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any other information normally available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution regarding a student's citizenship, previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational experience, documentation of the student's social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education for investigation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) After conducting the review of an application provided

indicating that an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with his or her application. The type of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of information are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) False claims of independent student status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) False claims of citizenship; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Use of false identities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(v) False statements of income; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any credible information indicating that any employee, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. The type of information that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility and funding of the institution and its students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the Secretary considers whether its counseling includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regarding_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered, or applied to a student's account; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid. This information includes the institution's refund policy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its standards of satisfactory progress, and other conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may alter the student's aid package; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements required for compliance with the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this part and the individual program regulations in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Shows no evidence of significant problems that affect, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer a Title IV, HEA program and that are identified in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must calculate this withdrawal rate according to the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) For an institution at which the majority of regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students begin and end the academic year on the same date, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must calculate the rate for that academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For an institution at which the majority of regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students do not begin and end the academic year on the same date, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must calculate the rate for any eight-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution must count all regular students who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled on the first day of classes of the period specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (l)(1) of this section, except those students who, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during that period_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Were entitled to and actually received in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at that institution of less than 25 percent for each of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's rate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As defined in 34 CFR 674.5, on loans made under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Perkins Loan Program to students for attendance at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that does not exceed 15 percent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Except that, if the Secretary determines that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is not administratively capable solely because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution fails to comply with paragraph (m)(1) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the Secretary will provisionally certify the institution

(1) Initiate a proceeding under subpart G of this part to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs, if_

percent, the institution must submit a default management plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that implements the measures described in appendix D to this

part. An institution that wishes to submit a default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan that deviates from the measures described in appendix D must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a justification for the deviation that includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rationale explaining why the measures from which the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviates are not appropriate for the institution's specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation. The institution must implement the default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan upon notification from the Secretary that the plan has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution

the institution receives the Secretary's notification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's cohort default rate. An institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to submit any written plans to the Secretary or a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary determines that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's cohort default rate, for each of the three most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's rate, is equal to or greater than the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of the determinations made under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the threshold rates are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution whose participation ends under paragraph (c)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section may not participate in the FFEL programs beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the date that the institution receives notification from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and continuing_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institution's participation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For the two subsequent fiscal years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may not participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs until the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Receives notification from the Secretary that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice ending the institution's participation is withdrawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Following the period described in paragraph (c)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

all requirements for participation in the FFEL programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in

the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the Secretary withdraws the notification of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loss of participation pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, the participation of the institution is restored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as of the date that the institution received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary of the loss of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Until July 1, 1998, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
college within the meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, or a Navajo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community college under the Navajo Community College Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7)(i) If the Secretary's designated department official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives written notice from an institution whose participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days from the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, that the institution intends to appeal the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may, notwithstanding &sect;668.26(d) continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the FFEL programs until no later than the 30th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If an institution satisfies the conditions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section for participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs until the 30th calendar day following the date on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the institution receives notification from the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the institution may, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding &sect;668.26(d), continue to participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs after that date, until the Secretary issues a decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the institution's appeal, if the institution, by the 30th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, files an appeal that is complete in all respects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal of an institution relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section is not considered incomplete by virtue of a guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's not having yet complied with_or having failed to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with_34 CFR 682.401(b)(14), which requires the agency to respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an institution's request for verification of data within 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days from the date on which the institution received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that request to the Secretary's designated department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to the Secretary's designated department official within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Appeal procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution may appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designated department official that is postmarked no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation is not accurate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The institution meets the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Fifteen percent or fewer of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loans for any twenty-four month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits its appeal; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) For any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds or more of the institution's students who are enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on at least a half-time basis are individuals from disadvantaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic backgrounds, as established by documentary evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the institution. Such evidence must relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualification by those students for an Expected Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of these students who received a degree, certificate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other recognized educational credential from the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred from the institution to a higher level educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at another institution for which the prior program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic progress toward completion of their educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The calculation does not include students who did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete their programs because they left the institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve in the armed forces; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more with respect to its former students who received a degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those students who, based on evidence submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a higher level educational program at another institution for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the prior educational program provided substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student, or the period of time between the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's loan application, if any, whichever is less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified data to the Secretary's designated department official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's appeal is not considered complete until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designated department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of written material submitted by the institution. No oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Secretary withdraws the notification of loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the FFEL programs sent to an institution under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the Secretary determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution's appeal satisfies one of the grounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7)(i) An institution that appeals under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section must submit a written request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the guaranty agency or agencies that guaranteed the loans used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the calculation of its cohort default rate to verify the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to calculate its cohort default rate and simultaneously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a copy of that request to the Secretary's designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The written request must include the names and social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security numbers of the borrowers the institution wishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to verify and detailed information on the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected inaccuracy in the data the institution is requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency to verify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) An institution must include in its appeal a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification by the institution's chief executive officer that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all information provided by the institution in support of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal is true and correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) An institution that appeals on the ground that it meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria contained in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must include in its appeal the following information:

before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which they entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

recognized educational credential at the participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such enrollment. Each eligible lender of a loan made under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations of the institution from the date the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv)(A) For an institution that changes its status from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of a location of one institution to that of a free-standing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the institution's status as of October 1 of the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For an institution that changes its status from that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a free-standing institution to that of a location of another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the applicable fiscal year and the combined number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who default during the applicable fiscal years from both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and all of its current locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For free-standing institutions that merge to form a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new, consolidated institution, the Secretary determines the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined number of students who default during the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years from all of the institutions that are merging. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For a location of one institution that becomes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of another institution, the Secretary determines the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of students who default during the applicable fiscal years from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respective locations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that remains'' is determined_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising

of the student's withdrawal date; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an institution charges by different periods for different charges, the ``period of enrollment for which the

institution must include any charges assessed the student for the period of enrollment or any portion of that period
of enrollment when calculating the refund.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) An institution shall determine whether a student has received an overpayment for noninstitutional costs for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) To determine if the student owes an overpayment, the institution shall subtract the noninstitutional costs
that the student incurred for that portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the
amount of all assistance (other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program) that
the institution disbursed to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The portion of the refund that an institution shall return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An institutional refund means the amount paid for institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which

or the institution must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

which the student has been charged; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Subtract the unpaid amount of the scheduled cash payment from the amount that may be retained by the institution
according to the institution's refund policy; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) An institution shall return the total amount of Title IV, HEA program assistance (other than amounts received
from the FWS Program) paid for institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged
if the unpaid amount of the student's scheduled cash payment is greater than or equal to the amount that may be retained
by the institution under the institution's refund policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) A student must repay to the institution or to the Title IV, HEA programs a portion of the overpayment as determined

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) If, as a result of a Federal audit or an audit performed at the direction of an institution or third-party servicer,
an expenditure made by the institution or servicer or the institution's or servicer's compliance with an applicable
requirement (including the lack of proper documentation), is questioned, the Secretary notifies the institution
or servicer of the questioned expenditure or compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the institution or servicer believes that the questioned expenditure or compliance was proper, the institution
or servicer shall notify the Secretary in writing of the institution's or servicer's position and the reasons for
that position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The institution's or servicer's response must be based on performing an attestation engagement in accordance
with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and must
be received by the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification to the institution or servicer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Based on the audit finding and the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary determines
the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to
the manner of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of an institution's
Title IV, HEA programs, the servicer shall notify each institution under whose contract the servicer owes a liability
of the determination. The servicer shall also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same
service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) An institution or third-party servicer that must repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay
those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification, unless_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary
questions expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies liabilities, then the Secretary
may determine that deferring recourse to the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by the act or omission giving rise to the liability
outweighs the importance of deferring collection action until completion of available appeal proceedings; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete assurance that recourse to that protection will be
fully available through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in the Secretary's notification, under paragraph
(a)(1) of this section, to the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party servicer
shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this
part unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation
incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and remains responsible
for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, as applicable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Withdraw the authority of the institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, as applicable, to commit, disburse, deliver, or cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Withdraw the authority of the institution or servicer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as applicable, to commit, disburse, deliver, or cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds except in accordance with a particular procedure; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) Withdraw the authority of the servicer to administer

(ii) Withdraw the authority of the servicer to administer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any aspect of any institution's participation in any

procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) An initiating official begins an emergency action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against an institution or third-party servicer by sending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or servicer a notice by registered mail, return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt requested. In an emergency action against a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, the official also sends the notice to each institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contracts with the servicer. The official also may transmit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice by other, more expeditious means if practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The emergency action takes effect on the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiating official mails the notice to the institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The notice states the grounds on which the emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is based, the consequences of the emergency action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution or servicer, as applicable, may request an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to show cause why the emergency action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) An initiating official takes emergency action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against an institution or third-party servicer only if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Receives information, determined by the official to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable, that the institution or servicer, as applicable, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violating any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or

limitation entered into under the authority of statutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to Title IV of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determines that immediate action is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Determines that the likelihood of loss from that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misuse outweighs the importance of awaiting completion of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding that may be initiated to limit, suspend, or terminate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as applicable_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The participation of the institution in one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The eligibility of the servicer to contract with any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to administer any aspect of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Examples of violations of a Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that cause misuse and the likely loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program funds include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Causing the commitment, disbursement, or delivery by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any party of Title IV, HEA program funds in an amount that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The amount for which students are eligible; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The amount of principal, interest, or special allowance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments that would have been payable to the holder of a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford, Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS loan if a refund allocable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that loan had been made in the amount and at the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Using, offering to make available, or causing the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or availability of Title IV, HEA program funds for educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The institution, servicer, or agents of the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or servicer have made a substantial misrepresentation as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in &sect;&sect;668.72, 668.73, or 668.74 related to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services;

ability to provide those services in full; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The institution, or servicer, as applicable, lacks the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative or financial ability to compensate by appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund for any portion of an educational program not completed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a student; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency
action against any institution under whose contract a third-party servicer commits the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after an emergency action becomes effective, an institution
or third-party servicer, as applicable, may not_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of aid to a student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program;

or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency action, the authority of the institution or servicer to
commit, disburse, deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds, or
the authority of the servicer to administer any aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program,
except in accordance with a particular procedure specified in the notice of emergency action, the institution or
servicer, as applicable, may not take any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except in accordance
with the procedure specified in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as applicable, the Secretary provides the institution or servicer,
as soon as practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action is unwarranted or should be modified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity to present evidence and argument to a show-cause official.
The initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for any emergency action that the initiating official
has begun. The show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the emergency action. The institution or servicer
may make its presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal meeting with the show-cause official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to
avoid unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, or repetitious matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency
action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified because_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, exist;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss
from the misuse described in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action promptly after consideration
of any argument and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as applicable, and the initiating official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination
promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no meeting is requested, after the official receives
all the material submitted by the institution in opposition to the emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party
servicer, the official also notifies each institution that contracts with the servicer of that determination. The
show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or modifying the statement of reasons provided in
the notice of emergency action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation,
suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under 34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer,
as applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the emergency action continues until a final decision is issued
in that proceeding, as provided in &sect;668.90(c), as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section,
the continuation, modification, or revocation of the emergency action is at the sole discretion of the initiating
official, or, if a show-cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or
servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the show-cause official to demonstrate that because
of facts occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating official or the show-cause meeting, continuation
of the emergency action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified or ended. The show-cause official
considers any written material submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency
action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The expiration, modification, or revocation of an emergency action against an institution or third-party servicer
does not bar subsequent emergency action against that institution on grounds other than those specifically identified
in the notice imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may include violation by an institution or third-party
servicer of an agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the prior emergency action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1)(i) A hearing official issues a written initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision in a hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The designated department official who began a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding against an institution or third-party servicer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The institution or servicer, as applicable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In the case of a proceeding against a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The hearing official may also transmit the notice by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other, more expeditious means if practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The hearing official issues the decision within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latest of the following dates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The 30th day after the last submission is filed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The 60th day after the last submission is filed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing official if the Secretary, upon request of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing official, determines that the unusual complexity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case requires additional time for preparation of the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing official does not request the parties to make any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posthearing submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The hearing official's initial decision states whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination sought by the designated department official is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted, in whole or in part. If the designated department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official brought a termination action against the institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate, issue an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial decision to fine the institution or servicer, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable, or, rather than terminating the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more limitations on the institution's participation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If, in a termination action against an institution, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing official finds that the institution has violated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of &sect;668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that termination of the institution's participation is warranted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If, in a termination action against a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, the hearing official finds that the servicer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violated the provisions of &sect;668.82(d)(1), the hearing official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also finds that termination of the institution's participation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer's eligibility, as applicable, is warranted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If an action brought against an institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer involves its failure to provide surety in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount specified by the Secretary under &sect;668.15, the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official finds that the amount of the surety established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary was appropriate, unless the institution can demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the amount was unreasonable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenced on the grounds described in &sect;668.17(a)(1), if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing official finds that an institution's Federal Stafford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate, as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.17(e), meets the conditions specified in &sect;668.17(a)(1) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing official also finds that the sanction sought by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated department official is warranted, except that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing official finds that no sanction is warranted if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution demonstrates that it has implemented the default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction measures described in Appendix D to this part; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In a termination action taken against an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or third-party servicer based on the grounds that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or servicer failed to comply with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.23(c)(3), if the hearing official finds that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or servicer failed to meet those requirements, the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official finds that the termination is warranted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) In a termination action against an institution based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the grounds that the institution is not financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible under &sect;668.15(c)(1), the hearing official finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the termination is warranted unless the institution demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all applicable conditions described in &sect;668.15(d)(4) have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been met; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) In a termination action against an institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer on the grounds that the institution or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, as applicable, engaged in fraud involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of any Title IV, HEA program, the hearing official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds that the termination action is warranted if the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official finds that the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in that fraud. Examples of fraud include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Falsification of any document received from a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document pertaining to the performance of any loan collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity, including activity that is not required by the HEA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The hearing official bases findings of fact only on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence considered at the hearing and on matters given judicial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. If a hearing is conducted solely through written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions, the parties must agree to findings of fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) (1) In a suspension proceeding, the Secretary reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing official's initial decision and issues a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision within 20 days after the initial decision. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary adopts the initial decision unless it is clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsupported by the evidence presented at the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary notifies the institution or servicer and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final decision. If the Secretary suspends the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation or servicer's eligibility, the suspension takes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on the later of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The day that the institution or servicer receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date specified in the designated department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official's original notice of intent to suspend the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation or servicer's eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A suspension may not exceed 60 days unless a designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
department official begins a limitation or termination proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this subpart before the expiration of that period. In that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, the period may be extended until a final decision is issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that proceeding according to paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) (1) In a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing official's initial decision automatically becomes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's final decision 30 days after the initial decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued and received by both parties unless, within that 30-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the institution or servicer, as applicable, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated department official appeals the initial decision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) A party may appeal the hearing official's initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision by submitting to the Secretary, within 30 days after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party receives the initial decision, a brief or other written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that explains why the party believes that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should reverse or modify the decision of the hearing official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At the time the party files its appeal submission, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party shall provide a copy of that submission to the opposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The opposing party shall submit its brief or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsive statement to the Secretary, with a copy to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellant, within 30 days after the opposing party receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellant's brief or written statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The appealing party may submit proposed findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact or conclusions of law. However, the proposed findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact must be supported by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The evidence introduced into the record at the hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Stipulations of the parties if the hearing consisted of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written submissions; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Matters that may be judicially noticed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Neither party may introduce new evidence on appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The initial decision of the hearing official imposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a fine or limiting or terminating the institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or servicer's eligibility does not take effect pending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The Secretary renders a final decision. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may delegate to a designated department official the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions described in paragraph (c)(2) (vii) through (ix) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) In rendering a final decision, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers only evidence introduced into the record at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and facts agreed to by the parties if the hearing consisted only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of written submissions and matters that may be judicially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noticed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) If the hearing official finds that a termination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may remand the case to the hearing official for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings consistent with the Secretary's decision. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary affirms the initial decision without issuing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of reasons, the Secretary adopts the opinion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing official as the decision of the Secretary. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary modifies, remands, or reverses the initial decision, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole or in part, the Secretary's decision states the reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the action taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Evidence relating to a period of time other than the

To the extent that the decision of the Secretary sustains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final audit determination or program review determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the provisions of &sect;668.24(c)(3), the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education will take steps to collect the debt at issue or

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Appendix A to Part 668_Standards for Acceptable Refund Policies by Participating Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of &sect;668.22(b)(1)(iv)(A), the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers an institution to have a fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy if the institution uses a policy that meets the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this appendix. These requirements do not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's obligation to comply with other Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The governing board of the institution must review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the schedule of all institutional charges and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies applicable to students. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The pricing of services and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policies have important consequences to students, parents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, and society; as such, pricing and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies must receive board attention and approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must seek consumer views in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of establishing and amending charge and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Decisions regarding institutional funds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately the sole responsibility of the institution's legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated fund custodians. However, consumer concerns do affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision making, and involving consumers in decision making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to charges and refunds is an essential approach for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing student needs and creating public awareness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(III) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must publish a current schedule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all student charges (including the costs of required supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment), publish a statement of the purpose for such charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related refund policies, have those statements readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available free of charge to current and prospective students, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiate that the costs of required supplies and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment to the students. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Students and parents have a right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
know what charges they will be expected to pay and what will or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be refunded. They also have a right to know what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services accompany payment of the charges. Informational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials published free for students and prospective students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ideal for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(IV) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must clearly designate all optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Charges that are mandatory and charges that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some students but required for others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(V) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must clearly identify charges and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published schedules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions determine on an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of activities such as processing applications and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student information, reserving academic positions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing the limits of institutional programs and services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution for the coming academic periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VI) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must refund housing rental charges, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to make the space available to other students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refundable. However, based on the program offered, space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some more flexible refund guideline for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VII) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must refund board charges in full, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent board charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be refunded on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
basis. It is reasonable to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed for the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VIII) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institutional refund policy must include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
E. For purposes of this policy, ``tuition charges'' include, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but are not limited to, charges for any equipment (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
books and supplies) issued by an institution to a student if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution specifies in the enrollment agreement a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge for equipment that the student actually obtains or if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution refers the student to a vendor operated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or an entity affiliated or related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The institution may exclude from the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund owed under this paragraph the documented cost to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of unreturnable equipment issued to the student in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with paragraph (VIII)E of this appendix or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returnable equipment issued to the student in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (VIII)E of this appendix if the student does not return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tear, within 20 days following the date of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal. For example, equipment is not considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned in good condition and, therefore, is unreturnable, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and sanitary reasons. The institution must clearly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conspicuously disclose in the enrollment agreement any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unreturnable. The institution must notify the student in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing prior to enrollment that return of the specific equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved will be required within 20 days of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(IX) The institution must assess no penalty charges where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, such as those involving late registration fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the action causing the charges to be levied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(X) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must advise students that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution officer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A student's written notification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an undesirable practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(XI) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must pay or credit refunds due in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;668.22(i)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. The informational materials must include the name, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title, and address of the official responsible for handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although charges and refund policies should reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of personal circumstances that may exist or develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to published policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. Appendix D to part 668 is amended by revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introductory paragraphs to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix D to Part 668_Default Reduction Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix describes measures that an institution with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs should find helpful in reducing defaults. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution with a fiscal year default rate that exceeds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold rate for a limitation, suspension, or termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action under &sect;668.17 may avoid that sanction by demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution has implemented the measures included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this appendix. Other institutions should strongly consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking these steps as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce defaults, the Secretary recommends that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution take the following measures:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) (1) The Secretary requires a lender and its third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with the lender to repay interest benefits and special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance or other compensation received on a loan guaranteed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a guaranty agency, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For any period beginning on the date of a failure by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lender or servicer, with respect to the loan, to comply with

any of the requirements set forth in &sect;682.406(a)(1)&hyph;(a)(6), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(9), and (a)(12);

(ii) For any period beginning on the date of a failure by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lender or servicer, with respect to the loan, to meet a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of guarantee coverage established by the guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency, to the date, if any, on which the guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinstated the guarantee coverage pursuant to policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures established by the agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For any period in which the lender or servicer, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the loan, violates the requirements of subpart C of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For any period beginning on the day after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's obligation to pay special allowance on the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates under &sect;682.302(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this section, a lender and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable third-party servicer shall be considered jointly and

severally liable for the repayment of any interest benefits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special allowance paid as a result of a violation of applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements by the servicer in administering the lender's FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) (A) The lender has not repaid in full the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Secretary of the liability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The Secretary is unable to collect the liability from

(c) (1) In addition to requiring repayment of reinsurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

with any agreement entered into under this part or violates any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, unless the servicer has been cited for a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrections to the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result of an incomplete or incorrect statement or a violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an applicable Federal requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this section, a guaranty agency and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special allowance, reinsurance paid, or other compensation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidation loan amounts attributed to Consolidation loans that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violate &sect;682.206(f)(1) as a result of a violation by the servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering any aspect of the FFEL programs under a contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with that guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

jointly and severally liable for the liabilities; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the liability within 30 days from the date the guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency receives notice from the Secretary of the liability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The guaranty agency has not made other satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements to pay the amount of the liability within 30 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the date the guaranty agency receives notice from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of the liability; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The Secretary is unable to collect the liability from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guaranty agency by offsetting the guaranty agency's first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

demonstrate that it meets the standards of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Based on the review of the materials provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, the Secretary determines if the servicer meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in this part. If the servicer does not, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may initiate an administrative proceeding under subpart G.

(a) This subpart governs the limitation, suspension, or termination by the Secretary of the eligibility of an otherwise
eligible lender to participate in the FFEL programs or the eligibility of a third-party servicer to enter into a contract
with an eligible lender to administer any aspect of the lender's FFEL programs. The regulations in this subpart apply
to a lender or third-party servicer that violates any statutory provision governing the FFEL programs or any regulations,
special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title
IV of the HEA prescribed under the FFEL programs. These regulations apply to lenders that participate only in a guaranty
agency program, lenders that participate in the FFEL programs, and third-party servicers that administer aspects
of a lender's FFELP portfolio. These regulations also govern the Secretary's disqualification of a lender or school
from participation in the FFEL programs under section 432(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act.

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The FFEL Program
consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan programs. These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended
(HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and certain technical changes made by the Cash Management Improvement
Act Amendments of 1992, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and the Higher Education Technical Amendments
of 1993. The regulations amend the FFEL Program loan discharge provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and guaranty
agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary is amending 34 CFR part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by Public Law 102&hyph;325, enacted July
23, 1992, as well as certain changes added by Public Law 103&hyph;66, enacted August 10, 1993 and Public Law 103&hyph;208,
enacted December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of federal student aid programs, and,
by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 14, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 682 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 2486). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be
repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which
a discussion of those issues may be found: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Amendment to &sect;682.208 to provide for borrower notification when there is a servicing change (page 2488);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Addition to &sect;682.402 to implement loan discharges if the student could not complete the educational
program because the school closed (page 2491); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Addition to &sect;682.402 to implement loan discharges if the student's eligibility to borrow was falsely
certified by the school (pages 2488&hyph;2490); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Addition to &sect;682.410 to implement administrative wage garnishment of borrowers who owe defaulted loans
(page 2491).

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary
has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined
by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those
sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with State, local, and
tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

&bull;The Secretary has expanded the definition of what constitutes a school's ``false certification of a student's
eligibility to borrow'' to include cases where a school signed a putative borrower's name on the loan application
or the promissory note. The Secretary will also provide relief under these procedures to borrowers who demonstrate
that the school, without authorization by the borrower, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's
authorization for electronic funds transfer, if the student did not receive the loan proceeds, either by actual delivery
of the funds or by application of the loan proceeds to institutional charges owed to the school.

&bull;The Secretary has partially deleted the requirement that, as a condition of eligibility for a closed school
or false certification discharge, a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a
loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any public fund. However, a borrower will still be required to assign
to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private
fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary has deleted the requirement for the student to certify that, as a condition of eligibility for

A number of commenters noted that Public Law 103&hyph;66 and Public Law 103&hyph;208 made changes to the statute upon
which the NPRM was based. The commenters recommended that regulatory provisions applying to borrower interest rates,
refunds of excess interest paid, origination fees, and insurance premiums, should be updated to reflect current
law. Some commenters recommended that a separate NPRM be issued to address the complex changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;208
to the provisions that mandate the refunding of excess interest.

regulations has been deleted, however, the Secretary has reserved that paragraph in these final regulations as the
location for future regulations relating to the refunding of excess interest that is required by section 427A(i)

Some commenters objected to the requirement that a lender must charge an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan borrower
a 6.5 percent origination/insurance fee. The commenters believed that the lender should have an option to charge
the borrower a lesser amount, as is permitted for a subsidized Federal Stafford Loan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to Public Law 103&hyph;66, section 428H(f)(1) of the HEA required the lender to charge an unsubsidized Federal
Stafford Loan borrower a 6.5 percent origination/insurance fee. Public Law 103&hyph;66 split the combined origination/insurance
fee into two separate components: a 3 percent origination fee that is required to be charged to the borrower, and a 1
percent insurance premium that may be charged to the borrower. The origination and insurance fees applicable to a
subsidized Federal Stafford Loan were also reduced by Public Law 103&hyph;66 to 3 percent and 1 percent respectively.
However, the HEA continues to permit a lender to charge a subsidized Federal Stafford Loan borrower a lesser amount
than the maximum loan origination fee, whereas no similar option exists for an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan
origination fee.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters favored an expansion in the notification requirements pertaining to an assignment of a loan
or a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower sends payments or communications concerning the loan.
The commenters believed that the notice required to be sent by the holder of the loan should apply to all borrowers,
and not be limited to only those borrowers in the grace or repayment periods. Some commenters also noted that Public
Law 103&hyph;208 made two changes to section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA: (1) The transferee (instead of the transferor)
is now required to notify the guaranty agency when a loan is sold or transferred; and (2) the transferor and the transferee
may now notify the borrower of the sale or transfer of a loan either jointly or separately (instead of only separately).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters objected to the requirement that, in general, the borrower's loan must be a legally enforceable
debt under applicable law by the holder of the loan to qualify a guaranty agency for a reinsurance payment under the
closed school and false certification discharge provisions. The commenters believed that students should have
their loans discharged, and the Secretary should reimburse guaranty agencies for such discharges, even if the borrower's
debt is legally unenforceable by the holder of the loan. Of particular concern to some commenters were cases where
the school signed the borrower's name on the loan documents or check. While the commenters generally recognized that
the borrower technically does not owe the amount of the unenforceable debt, they were concerned that borrowers may
not have the resources to pursue a legal or administrative determination of loan enforceability. The commenters
also believed that even if the borrower did pursue that avenue, it could take many years to reach a resolution, during
which the borrower would be subject to collection activity, damaged credit rating, and if in default, would be considered
to be ineligible for additional federal student financial aid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related area, some commenters expressed concern that, under current federal regulations, a borrower would not
receive a closed school or false certification discharge if federal reinsurance on the loan had been lost because
of violations of due diligence or other programmatic requirements committed by the lender or the guarantor. The commenters
believed that Congress intended to help a borrower who was victimized by a school's closing or false certification
of eligibility to borrow, events that are beyond the control of the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary is persuaded that the term ``falsely certified,'' as used in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA, should be
defined to include certain cases where a school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note.
The definition of the term ``falsely certified'' is extensively discussed in response to comment 48. Because of the
similarity of such cases to those involving the execution of the application or note by the school in the name of the
borrower, the Secretary concluded that cases in which the school improperly endorsed the borrower's signature on
the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer should also be addressed under these regulatory
procedures, although such misconduct is not by itself a false certification. Under these final regulations, therefore,
the Secretary will provide relief to borrowers in cases of unauthorized endorsements, but except for the instances
in which the school both falsely created a loan application or promissory note for a student and then endorsed the student's
name on the loan check, the lender is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of a borrower's signature on the lender's
loan check, and should continue to bear the risk of an improper endorsement. In those instances, although a borrower
may under the procedure as modified here receive a discharge of any obligation to repay that portion of a loan disbursed
by a check which he or she neither endorsed nor received the proceeds of, the lender will not be permitted to receive
or retain a claim payment for that amount. Because the Secretary considers the lender to have not had routine access
to the written authorization for electronic funds transfer, on the other hand, the lender would not have occasion
to know of an unauthorized execution of that authorization in the name of the borrower, and would not be held at risk
for such unauthorized disbursements under these procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary also agrees that the loss of federal reinsurance on the loan due to violations of due diligence or other
programmatic requirements committed by the lender or the guarantor should not prevent an eligible borrower from
receiving a closed school or false certification discharge. In such cases, the Secretary will use his authority pursuant
to &sect;682.406(b) to waive his right to refuse to make a reinsurance payment on the loan. Thus, (except in the case
of a falsely endorsed check, as noted above) a lender may receive a claim payment and a guaranty agency may receive a
reinsurance payment on a loan for which an eligible borrower would qualify for a closed school or false certification
discharge, even though violations of program requirements committed by the lender or guarantor may have otherwise
sufficed to cause federal reinsurance on the loan to have been lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the last few years, Congress and the Secretary have taken steps to combat unscrupulous individuals and program
participants who have used the FFEL Program to exploit innocent students and taxpayers. The discharge of loans owed
by the innocent victims is consistent with those actions. The Department intends to pursue the individuals and organizations
who caused this situation so that the taxpayer can be reimbursed, and future students are protected.

 As will be further discussed in response to comment 48, the Secretary has expanded the definition of what constitutes
a school's ``false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow'' to include a loan for which the school signed
the name of an innocent victim on the application for the loan or the promissory note. The regulations will also provide
relief in cases in which the borrower signed the loan application or promissory note, but the school signed the borrower's
name on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, providing that the student did not receive, directly
or indirectly, the benefits of the loan proceeds disbursed by that loan check or by virtue of the authorization for
electronic funds transfer signed by the school.

 Some commenters believed that information concerning closed school or false certification discharges should be
made available to the borrower at the time the loan is made or while the student is in school. The commenters believed
that this important information may be easily overlooked by or not reach the borrower after the school has closed or
the student has withdrawn.

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a Federal Consolidation Loan borrower must provide the disbursement

a condition that pre-dated the Consolidation Loan. The commenters believed that this information is present in the
borrower's Consolidation Loan file and the borrower should not be required to submit information already in the possession
of the lender.

 In general, regulatory language is more precise if it is based on the singular form of a noun. In the case of a closed school
loan discharge, this permits each loan to be evaluated individually, and not be dependent on factors associated only
with other loans. If the borrower qualifies for a discharge of more than one loan, then each loan will be discharged.

Federal Consolidation Loan that repaid a loan that would have otherwise been discharged under the closed school provisions.

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of
the HEA to ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;discharge the borrower's liability on the loan&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''
if the student could not complete the program in which the student was enrolled because of the school's closure. Because
section 437(c) provides for discharge of loans because of events that occur before the borrower enters repayment,
the borrower's liability on the loan is the amount outstanding at that time, before the borrower enters repayment.
If the borrower repays some or all of that amount, the discharge would be ineffective unless it includes relief from
that liability through reimbursement for the amounts paid on the loan, and those amounts include amounts borrowed
through a Consolidation Loan. The Secretary believes that the borrower's Consolidation Loan should be credited
for the amount of the closed school loan discharge that would have been applicable to the borrower's loan before it
was consolidated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters believed that the 90-day period prior to a school's closing during which a student who withdrew would
be eligible for a loan discharge is too short for many students who attended correspondence schools. The commenters
noted that such students frequently are considered ``withdrawn'' as of the date of the last lesson submitted by the
student if the student did not submit the next scheduled lesson in accordance with the schedule of lessons established
under &sect;682.602. However, the school may not have been considered to have officially closed until more than 90
days have elapsed from the date the student would be considered to have withdrawn under &sect;682.605(b)(3). The
commenters observed that in many cases, it was the school that withdrew from the student by its failure to grade lessons
or provide subsequent lessons, or to otherwise communicate with a student who attempted to learn if the school was
still operating. The commenters believed that correspondence students, unlike other students who attended a school
at a school's actual location, are not in a position to see an obvious deterioration in the school's ability to provide
education to students.

 The Secretary believes that the 90-day period generally is sufficient for all categories of students. The Secretary
notes that correspondence students may actually be in a better position than other students to realize that a school's
ability to provide training and services is deteriorating. The absence of communication from a correspondence school
to a student is an unmistakable sign that the school is not fulfilling its part of the enrollment agreement with the
student. Other types of schools may be able to effectively camouflage their deteriorating capabilities and prevent
students from seeing the true state of the school's fiscal and administrative situation, but a correspondence school
student cannot be so easily deceived. The lack of communication from a school is a clear fact that speaks for itself.
However, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that in some unique circumstances an extension of the 90-day period
may be appropriate.

 Some commenters noted that schools that close will frequently phase-out their operations by sequentially eliminating
individual programs even though the school remains open. The commenters believed that by linking a borrower's eligibility
for a loan discharge to the date that the school ceased to provide educational instruction in all programs, the regulations
would penalize a borrower who withdrew from school because of a terminated or deteriorated program earlier than 90
days before the school officially closed.

 The closed school loan discharge authorized in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA is not restricted only to a loan made for
attendance at an eligible school. The Secretary believes that Congress was aware of instances in which a school or
its branch may have lost eligibility, but the school continued to certify loan applications under an eligible school
identification code. The Secretary believes this is the reason why there is no requirement in section 437(c)(1) of
the HEA that links a borrower's eligibility for a closed school loan discharge to only a loan certified by an eligible
school.

 A loan that is discharged due to the borrower's death, permanent and total disability, or bankruptcy, is considered
``paid in full'' for the purposes of &sect;682.414(a)(2). The Secretary will add a closed school loan discharge to
the definition of the term ``paid in full'' found in &sect;682.414(a)(2), but does not believe it is necessary to otherwise
amend the requirements pertaining to the return of promissory notes (found in &sect;682.414(a)(4) of the current
regulations) in the manner recommended by the commenters. The return of a borrower's promissory note pursuant to
a closed school discharge does not need to be accomplished any differently than the return of a borrower's promissory
note pursuant to any other type of discharge.

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a borrower who requests a closed school loan discharge must submit
the sworn statement described in the regulations. The commenters believed the sworn statement is unnecessary in
cases where the holder of the loan or the guaranty agency has reliable information in their possession showing that
the borrower was in attendance at the school when it closed or within 90 days before it closed. The commenters believed
the borrower's loan obligation should be discharged based on those existing records.

 The Secretary believes the borrower's sworn statement is necessary to adequately protect the interests of the taxpayers.
The information provided on the borrower's sworn statement is not limited to the isolated historical record of the
borrower's attendance at the closed school. For example, the borrower must state whether he or she took advantage
of a teach-out or transferred academic credits from the closed school to another school. The borrower must also agree
to cooperate with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with &sect;682.402(d)(4).
This information, and the borrower's agreement to cooperate, will not be in the possession of the guaranty agency
and must be obtained in the borrower's sworn statement.

If a student chooses to transfer any amount of academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school,

the student would not meet the requirement contained in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA that restricts a closed school

Some commenters recommended that the regulations define the term ``teach-out at another school.'' The commenters

for purposes of a closed school loan discharge. The commenters suggested that the key elements of a teach-out are:
(a) No charges additional to the original program cost; (b) identity of subject matter taught; (c) geographic proximity
between the original and teach-out schools; (d) demonstrated compatibility of program structure and scheduling
(

The Secretary believes that a prescriptive regulatory definition of ``teach-out'' is unnecessary. The Secretary
notes that because a student may decline to complete the program through a teach-out at another school for any reason,
it is therefore reasonable to conclude that a student who chooses to participate in a teach-out and completes the program,
has demonstrated an acceptance of those teach-out conditions. In short, a student can be protected from being forced
to accept what he or she believes to be an onerous teach-out condition by simply declining the teach-out. A student
who, even though inconvenienced, chooses to complete his or her program through a teach-out, has received value from
the loan and needs no loan discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary asks interested parties to submit information to him concerning the actual costs paid by students who
completed their programs through teach-outs. The Secretary will evaluate those costs to determine if the regulations
should be revised in the future to permit a discharge based on certain circumstances.

a school or other related parties, were concerned that a borrower may be unable to take time away from work, home, or
other activities to travel to multiple court appearances needed to assist the Secretary or his designee in the enforcement
action. The commenters believed that a borrower should be required to assist in an enforcement action only to the extent

: It would not be in the interests of the Secretary or the taxpayer to make unreasonable demands on the borrower when
pursuing an enforcement action. It would equally not be in the interests of the Secretary or the taxpayer to create
an opportunity for a borrower to frustrate the Secretary's enforcement action by claiming that he or she was unavailable
to testify. The use of the word ``cooperate'' in the regulations implies a process of two or more parties reasonably
working together toward a common goal, and needs no further elaboration.

also believed that the Secretary has no statutory right to any claim against a state tuition recovery fund because
the HEA fails to specifically provide the secretary with that right. The commenters noted that section 437(c)(2)
of the HEA limits the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right to a loan refund only to the borrower's rights
``*&blank;*&blank;* against the institution and its affiliates and principals.'' The commenters contended that
there is no indication that Congress intended the Secretary to have access to state funds or to require states to participate
economically in closed school loan discharges. The commenters believed that the HEA's omission of state tuition
recovery funds (or any other private or public fund) reflects the principal of statutory construction ``

 The Secretary believes that the statutory authority permitting the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right
to recover a loan refund from the school, its affiliates, or principals clearly contemplates the recovery of refunds
from private funds. A private fund is funded by parties who are directly or indirectly associated with the school,
and the HEA intends that the Secretary shall have a legal claim to a private tuition recovery fund in the event of a school
closure. Although they may be categorized as ``public funds,'' it is the Secretary's understanding that many state
tuition recovery funds rely in whole, or in part, on private funding provided by a school, its owners, or affiliates.
Therefore, the Secretary believes that a borrower's assignment of recovery rights against a public fund is applicable
only to the extent that a state tuition recovery fund or any other such public fund contains private money. The public
money in those funds should not be considered.

rights (unspecified) unnecessarily, despite the statement in &sect;682.402(d)(5)(iii) that permits the borrower

 In some cases, a guaranty agency may not become aware of a school's closure until significantly after the date the school
actually closed. Therefore, the only workable way to create timeframes for guaranty agencies to perform certain
actions, such as notifying lenders to suspend collection efforts, would be to tie those timeframes to the date that
the agency first became aware, or was notified by the Secretary, that a school had closed.

 Some commenters believed that the regulations should require a guaranty agency to provide loan-specific information
to lenders so that lenders can more effectively suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to loans
made at closed schools. The commenters noted that a lender would not be able to identify a PLUS borrower if the guarantor
notified the lender of the school code and closure date only.

 The Secretary believes that because the loan application retained by the lender will have the name of the school and
the period of enrollment for which the loan was made, the lender should be able to determine which individuals it should
suspend collection efforts against once the lender is notified of the date a school closed. The Secretary encourages
a guaranty agency to provide assistance to a lender that believes it is unable to identify the appropriate PLUS borrowers.

 Some commenters recommended that a guaranty agency be required to suspend collection activities on loans that it
holds for borrowers who the agency believes may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. The commenters noted
that this is a requirement in the analogous regulation in &sect;682.402(e)(6)(iv) and (v) with respect to false certification

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must consult with representatives of the closed
school, the school's licensing agency, the accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties to learn the current
address of borrowers whose loans are held by the guaranty agency, and who have been identified as potentially eligible
for a closed school loan discharge. The commenters believed that the skiptracing efforts required under &sect;682.410(b)(6)
are more likely to be successful than contacts with the closed school and its related agencies.

 Some commenters believed that a guaranty agency should not be the party that mails a discharge application to a borrower
identified under this subparagraph of the regulations. Instead, the commenters believed it would be more appropriate
for the guaranty agency to mail the application package to the lender or servicer, who would then mail it to the borrower.
The commenters believed that this change would assist the lender in determining when to cease collections and would
also avoid any borrower confusion.

any time limits set by the lender, guaranty agency, or Secretary.

 There are no time-driven requirements with respect to the submission of information that a borrower must meet to qualify
for a closed school loan discharge. Perhaps the commenters misinterpreted the lender's requirement in &sect;682.402(d)(7)(ii)
to resume collection efforts against a borrower who failed to submit, within 60 days, the written request and sworn
statement necessary for loan discharge. However, that requirement only has the effect of reactivating collection
efforts, and does not disqualify the borrower from later submitting a complete application for loan discharge.

 The Secretary does not believe that either he or a guaranty agency will always be the first to know that a specific borrower
may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. For example, the school itself could notify the lender that it had
closed, or a legal aid group working on behalf of students could notify the lender of students who it believed were eligible.
The Secretary believes that it would be in the best interests of the borrower to permit a lender to exercise its judgment
concerning the reliability of the sources of information it receives.

 Some commenters believed that a lender that resumes collection activity against a borrower who fails to submit the
documentation required for a closed school loan discharge should be required to grant forbearance to the borrower
to absolve the borrower of any delinquency status existing on the loan, including delinquency that occurred before
the date the lender suspended collection activity. The commenters believed that the borrower's delinquency is generally
the result of the borrower's inability to pay due to circumstances caused by the school.

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a payment received by the lender from or on behalf of the borrower
after the lender filed a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency must be forwarded to the guaranty agency within 30
days of its receipt. The commenters contended that the guaranty agency is not the legal holder of the loan until it pays
a claim, and therefore has no right to the payment.

 The Secretary sees no benefit in having the borrower's payment in the possession of the party that has forwarded other
loan related documents to the guaranty agency. The Secretary is aware of at least two ways for a lender to forward the
borrower's payment to a guaranty agency so that it can be applied to the borrower's outstanding loan balance: the lender
could cash the borrower's check and forward its own check payable to the guaranty agency on behalf of the borrower,
or the lender could forward the borrower's original check to the agency and the agency could hold the check until it

 The borrower had an obligation to repay the loan to the lender. The borrower has no obligation to repay the loan (it has
been discharged) to the guaranty agency. The borrower should be informed by the party to whom the borrower had been
obligated (the lender, if the claim was filed by the lender, or the guaranty agency, if the borrower's loan was held
by the guaranty agency) that the borrower's obligation to repay the loan to that party has been discharged.

 This issue would be more appropriately addressed in the definition of a school's cohort default rate in 34 CFR Part
668. While the Secretary does not believe that a school that falsely certified a borrower's eligibility should be
allowed to benefit from that false certification by having its default rate reduced as a consequence, he is studying
this issue to determine the appropriate treatment of such cases, and will make a decision when information concerning
actual cases of false certification discharges is available.

 Some commenters objected to the restriction that a false certification discharge would only apply if the false certification
was made by an ``eligible'' institution. The commenters believed that the HEA intended the false certification discharge
provision to apply to certifications made by both ``eligible'' and ``ineligible'' schools.

 This was discussed in detail on page 2490 of the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). The Secretary has
been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability on a loan if the
student's eligibility to borrow ``*&blank;*&blank;* was falsely certified by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
eligible
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 institution *&blank;*&blank;*. '' (emphasis added.) The statute prescribes the scope of the discharge for false
certification under section 437(c) as extending to those instances in which the ``student's eligibility to borrow
under this part was falsely certified by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
eligible institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 20 U.S.C. 1087(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters proposal would have the effect of ignoring this language, which on its face limits relief to individuals
whose personal eligibility status was falsely certified, rather than to those who contend that they were ineligible
because the school at which they were enrolled was not an ``eligible institution.'' This limitation embodies a congressional
choice to exclude those grounds that were really challenges to the eligibility status of the school itself, and nothing
in the language or the legislative history suggests that this limitation is inadvertent or unintended. Moreover,
institutional eligibility rests directly and indirectly on a host of qualifications. The lack of one or more of these
qualities in a school mistakenly determined to be eligible by the Department would, under the commenters' view, suffice
to make eligible for discharge 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 borrowers enrolled at the institution while the deficiency persisted_a period that could stretch over several years_regardless
of whether that deficiency related to the adequacy of the training and skills provided to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text itself and the legislative history show no intention of such a broad and costly view of the discharge provision.
The Secretary does not, however, consider borrowers who attended schools that allegedly lacked eligibility to be
barred by that alleged deficiency from relief under the false certification provision, but merely that the falsity
on which they would seek relief must relate to a certification about their personal eligibility, and not that of the
allegedly ineligible institution. The Secretary does not have the authority to discharge a loan that was made to a
borrower for attendance at an ineligible school.

: Some commenters noted that lenders and guaranty agencies generally are not required to keep loan records longer
than five years after the date a loan is paid in full. In light of the borrower's statutory right to a false certification
discharge for loans received on or after January 1, 1986, the commenters recommended that the regulations prescribe
the procedures to be followed by lenders and guaranty agencies who learn of borrowers who claim to have repaid their
loans in full more than five years ago, but for whom the lender or guaranty agency has no existing records.

cases where a student admitted to a school on the basis of a purported ability to benefit from the school's training
did not meet the applicable requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit. The commenters believed
that the HEA did not envision any restriction as to what would constitute a school's false certification of a student's
eligibility to borrow under the FFEL Program. Other commenters believed that some restrictions should apply, and
proposed additional acts and certifications of a school that should be construed as false certifications. Some commenters
were pleased with the regulations as written, and recommended no changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The additional acts and certifications by a school that the commenters proposed were the same as those discussed
in the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). For the reasons stated on pages 2488&hyph;2490 of the NPRM,
and for the additional reasons discussed earlier in response to comment 5, the Secretary believes that the term ``falsely
certified,'' when used for purposes of a false certification discharge, applies to cases involving a school's invalid
certification that a student had the ability to benefit from the training offered by the school, or cases where the
school signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note, and certain cases where the school wrongfully
endorsed a person's name on the loan check, or the borrower's authorization for electronically transferring loan
proceeds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that if the school rather than the student signed a person's name on the loan application or
the promissory note, the putative borrower is not aware that a loan was being applied for and had no intention of entering
into an agreement to repay a loan. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a borrower who did not sign the application
or promissory note could not have completely understood that a check later presented for endorsement would represent
the proceeds of such a loan, and would not have intended to signify by endorsing such a check or authorization to release
funds that he or she agreed to become obligated to repay a loan. A school that signed a person's name on a precursory document
(the loan application or the promissory note) effectively prevented the person from being fully aware of the relationship
normally apparent to a borrower who first completes an application for a loan and later receives a loan disbursement
as a result of that application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that in some cases, an unscrupulous school may obtain the valid signature of a borrower
on the loan application or promissory note and will later sign the student's name on the loan check or the authorization
for electronic funds transfer. However, despite these actions, a student could have materially benefitted from
the loan proceeds by a reduction of the charges owed to the school or by otherwise receiving proceeds of the loan delivered
by the school. The Secretary believes that a person who signed the loan application and promissory note should be considered
an individual who was aware that he or she requested a loan. Therefore, if the borrower (or student on whose behalf a
parent borrowed a PLUS Loan) was enrolled at the school during the period of time that the loan (or an installment thereof)
was intended to cover, and someone other than the borrower signed the borrower's name on a loan check or authorization
for electronic funds transfer, causing the loan proceeds to be applied to the student's account to satisfy a liability
for tuition and other charges owed to the school, or to be delivered to the borrower, it is reasonable to conclude that
the borrower by that action received the proceeds of the loan he or she had applied. Because that borrower obtained
the benefits of the loan disbursement, even though the borrower realized that he or she did not sign the loan check or
the authorization for electronic funds transfer, that borrower would be legally obligated with respect to that disbursement.
In this case, the Secretary does not believe that a loan discharge was contemplated by Congress. However, if it is determined
that the borrower or student did not benefit from the loan proceeds, the Secretary believes that the borrower should
be relieved of any obligation to repay the amount of the loan proceeds transmitted as a result of a falsely signed loan
check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, and that such relief can be included in the procedures adopted
for discharges under section 437(c) of the HEA.

The Secretary is concerned with the plight of students who have been misled by unscrupulous schools, or who have been
harmed by a school's failure to fulfill its obligations (such as the payment of a refund to the student). Practices
of this sort are violations of 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, which governs misrepresentations by schools. The Secretary
will take a broad range of sanctions against schools to enforce these provisions. The Secretary also notes that recent
changes made to Title IV, Part H of the HEA will reduce the incidence of school malfeasance. Further, the Secretary
will determine if relief can be provided to such students in future regulations or legislative amendments. However,
not all cases of school malfeasance can currently be classified as a school's ``false certification of a student's
eligibility to borrow'' that would permit a borrower to receive a loan discharge under the HEA. For example, although
misrepresentations regarding the school's educational program or its financial or administrative capability,
including the school's placement services or the quality of the school's facilities, faculty, or equipment, may
well have induced the student to enroll at the school, those representations are not part of the process of ``certification''
of the student's eligibility to borrow.

the regulations provide relief where the school, without borrower authorization, endorsed the borrower's name
on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, providing that the student did not receive, directly
or indirectly, the benefits of the loan proceeds disbursed by that loan check or authorization for electronic funds
transfer that was signed by the school. The regulations will include provisions for a borrower to appeal to the Secretary
if the borrower disagrees with a guaranty agency's decision that the signatures in question were signed by the borrower.

Some commenters believed it was unnecessary for the student to certify that he or she was certified by the school on
the application for the loan as an eligible student. The commenters believed that this information is seldom known
to students because they may never see or understand what the school wrote on the application. The commenters noted
that the student could generally deduce that the school had made such a certification by the fact that a lender made
the loan, but believe that the same deduction could just as easily be made by a guaranty agency or the Secretary.

the student's program was intended to provide training is evidence that the student was able to benefit from the education
received, even though the school may have improperly tested, or failed to test, the student's ability to benefit from
the school's training.

 Some commenters questioned what would constitute a student's ``reasonable attempt to obtain employment'' and questioned
whether it would be fair to expect the student to be able to document, or even remember such attempts that may have been
made many years ago.

 In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a student who states that he or she made a ``reasonable attempt to obtain
employment'' will be presumed to have done so. The student is simply being asked to sign a statement to that effect.

 Some commenters, while believing that borrower cooperation is important in an enforcement action undertaken against
a school or other related parties, were concerned that a borrower may be unable to take time away from work, home, or
other activities to travel to multiple court appearances needed to assist the Secretary or his designee in the enforcement
action. The commenters believed that a borrower should be required to assist in an enforcement action only to the extent
practicable for the borrower.

 Some commenters opposed the requirement that a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any
right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private or public fund. The commenters were particularly
concerned with the effect they believed this requirement would have upon state tuition recovery funds. The commenters
also believed that the Secretary has no statutory right to any claim against a state tuition recovery fund because
the HEA fails to specifically provide the secretary with that right. The commenters noted that the section 437(c)(2)
of the HEA limits the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right to a loan refund only to the borrower's rights
``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;against the institution and its affiliates and principals.'' The commenters contend
that there is no indication that Congress intended the Secretary to have access to state funds or to require states
to participate economically in false certification discharges. The commenters believed that the HEA's omission
of state tuition recovery funds (or any other private or public fund) reflects the principal of statutory construction

 Some commenters questioned why a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan
refund (up to the amount discharged) with respect to the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was
received. The commenters believed that the assignment of a borrower's rights pursuant to the enrollment agreement
would not gain anything for the Secretary. They were concerned that the borrower would be forced to surrender some
rights (unspecified) unnecessarily, despite the statement in &sect;682.402(e)(5)(iii) that permits the borrower
(or student) to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise unrelated to
the loan discharged.

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must review records available from sources other
than the guarantor after receiving a false certification claim from a lender or a discharge request from a borrower.
The commenters believed this requirement is logistically unrealistic and unnecessarily complicates and delays

 The Secretary believes that the guaranty agency is in the best position to consult with other knowledgeable parties
concerning a school's alleged false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow. The Secretary believes
that the 90-day time period allows sufficient time for an agency to examine the lender's false certification claim
in light of the information available to the agency and to either pay or return the claim to the lender.

 Some commenters believed that a lender that resumes collection activity against a borrower who fails to submit the
documentation required for a false certification discharge should be required to grant forbearance to the borrower
to absolve the borrower of any delinquency status existing on the loan, including delinquency that occurred before
the date the lender suspended collection activity. The commenters believed that the borrower's delinquency is generally
the result of the borrower's inability to pay due to circumstances caused by the school.

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a payment received by the lender from or on behalf of the borrower
after the lender filed a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency must be forwarded to the guaranty agency within 30
days of its receipt. The commenters contended that the guaranty agency is not the legal holder of the loan until it pays
a claim, and therefore has no right to the payment.

If a borrower, or a borrower's representative remits a payment for a loan obligation that has been discharged, even
though he or she previously has had the payment returned with a notice that the obligation has been discharged and no
further payments are required, the Secretary believes it is reasonable to conclude that a subsequent payment from
that individual is an indication that he or she has expressed a desire to repay the discharged loan. The Secretary does
not believe that the borrower's (or his or her representative's) desire to repay the loan should be frustrated or the
taxpayer denied the recovery of such payments.

Under the proposed regulations, a guaranty agency was required to attempt an annual IRS offset against a borrower
who owed a defaulted loan if the agency had not attempted to garnish the borrower's wages. Conversely, if an agency
had initiated wage garnishment procedures against the borrower, it was not required to attempt an annual IRS offset,
but could do so if it decided that it would be an appropriate action to take in addition to wage garnishment. Based on
Public Law 102&hyph;589, the Secretary will now require a guaranty agency to attempt an annual IRS tax refund offset
against both categories of borrowers.

Some commenters noted that the Secretary's guidance to guaranty agencies in July 1993 concerning Public Law 102&hyph;589
explained that the law no longer required the Secretary to hold a loan to be collected by IRS offset, therefore, a guaranty
agency was no longer required to assign a loan temporarily to the Secretary in order to allow the Secretary to collect
the loan by federal income tax refund offset. The commenters recommended that references to such assignments be deleted

The procedures that a guaranty agency must follow when attempting to garnish a borrower's wages are mandated by section

Some commenters asked if the wage garnishment procedures would apply against borrowers and employers who were subject

that the garnishment provisions of the HEA apply ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank; (N)otwithstanding any provision
of State law *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The commenters observed that because of the difficulty and low success ratio of
obtaining a judgment through tribal courts, most creditors no longer even make the attempt.

Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts; it does
not preempt such laws of a foreign nation. Certain tribes of American Indians are considered to have the same relationship
with the United States as do foreign nations. Therefore, the laws of those tribes are not preempted by the wage garnishment
provisions of the HEA.

Only a borrower's disposable pay is subject to garnishment. Since ``disposable pay'' is defined as that part of a borrower's
compensation from an employer remaining after the deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld, any such
deductions ``take precedence'' and will affect the amount recovered from the borrower through garnishment. The
Secretary has no authority to modify the withholding orders issued by other entities legally empowered to garnish
the borrower's pay for other purposes.

Some commenters believed that a guaranty agency should be permitted to automatically garnish the wages of a borrower
who failed to maintain the terms of a repayment agreement with the guaranty agency. The commenters believed that it
is unnecessary to provide further notice or appeal opportunities to a borrower who has broken the terms of the repayment
agreement. Similarly, other commenters believed that a guaranty agency should be permitted to proceed with wage
garnishment against a borrower who has defaulted on a loan without being required to offer a repayment opportunity
to the borrower. The commenters believed that a borrower who has defaulted on a loan has already had numerous opportunities
to repay the loan. Some commenters suggested that a borrower be limited to only one repayment opportunity.

All attempted garnishments must be preceded by a notice to the borrower of the guaranty agency's intention to initiate
garnishment proceedings and an explanation of the borrower's rights, including the right to a hearing. The due process
protection afforded the borrower under the HEA's garnishment rules renders previous repayment arrangements between
the borrower and the agency irrelevant. Each garnishment action must be able to stand on its own as far as compliance
with the requirements of the statute and regulations is concerned.

Some commenters believed that the wage garnishment provisions of the HEA applied only to a borrower who entered into
a repayment agreement with the guaranty agency and then later failed to comply with the terms of that agreement. The
commenters believed there is no statutory authority to garnish the wages of a borrower simply because the borrower
has defaulted on the loan obligation and has not made arrangements with the guaranty agency to repay the debt.

The HEA permits a guaranty agency to garnish the pay of a borrower who ``*&blank;*&blank;* is not currently making
required repayment under a repayment agreement *&blank;*&blank;*.'' A borrower who owes a defaulted loan and has
simply refused to make any repayment arrangement with a guaranty agency would certainly fit that description. Otherwise,
borrowers could shield themselves from wage garnishment by refusing to enter into agreements to repay their loans
to guaranty agencies. The HEA and the regulations are not designed to provide incentives to borrowers who refuse to
repay their debts.

Some commenters believed that the terms of the repayment agreement opportunity that a guaranty agency must offer
a borrower prior to wage garnishment must be similar to the terms offered to a borrower under the loan rehabilitation
program, that is, the borrower may not be required to pay more than a reasonable and affordable amount.

Section 488A(a)(4) of the HEA states that an individual subject to wage garnishment shall be provided an opportunity
to enter into a written agreement with the guaranty agency under terms agreeable to the guaranty agency. Unlike other
areas of the HEA that contain provisions mandating that the borrower's payment be ``reasonable and affordable,''
the wage garnishment section of the HEA contains no such requirement. The Secretary believes this is because Congress
realized that a borrower who has not repaid his or her loan will have had numerous opportunities to have done so prior
to the initiation of a wage garnishment proceeding. For example, the borrower will have already declined the opportunity
to make payments under the loan rehabilitation program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since it would make no sense to demand a payment amounts from a borrower who could document that he or she was
unable to pay those amounts, the Secretary encourages a guaranty agency, even at this late point, to attempt to accommodate
a borrower who expresses a willingness to repay the loan but who is unable to do so under the terms proposed by the guaranty
agency because of a documented hardship explained by the borrower.

Some commenters believed a guaranty agency should be permitted to include a notice to the borrower about wage garnishment
with the agency's other notices to the borrower about hearing opportunities available to the borrower with respect
to IRS offset procedures and credit bureau reporting. The commenters recommended that a guaranty agency not be required
to provide the borrower with an opportunity for a hearing more than once every 12 months. The commenters also believed
that if the borrower had received a hearing and unsuccessfully contested the existence or the amount of the debt, the
borrower need not be provided another hearing on those issues.

As permitted under &sect;682.410(b)(5)(vi)(H), a guaranty agency may send a combined notice, or separate notices
to a borrower concerning credit bureau reporting, IRS offset, wage garnishment, and any other enforcement action
that may be taken to collect the debt. However, each garnishment proceeding taken against a borrower must comply with
the notice and due process requirements that are unique to wage garnishment.

Comment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must sue an employer who fails to comply with a
garnishment order. The commenters note that section 488A(a)(6) of the HEA provides an option by stating that a guaranty
agency ``*&blank;*&blank;* may sue the employer.'' Other commenters recommended that the regulations permit a
guaranty agency to decline to sue an employer who fails to comply with the wage garnishment order if the agency can demonstrate
that the expected cost and probability of success of the litigation did not justify a lawsuit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The statutory language provides the authority for a guaranty agency to sue the employer. A guaranty agency is not
required to garnish the wages of borrowers who owe defaulted loans, but if an agency chooses to do so, it must follow
the garnishment procedures prescribed in these regulations. In order to protect the interests of borrowers and taxpayers,
the Secretary believes a guaranty agency should make use of the full extent of the statutory authority available to
it under the HEA to compel an employer to comply with a wage garnishment order. The Secretary cannot envision any realistic
probability that an agency would be unsuccessful in its suit against an employer that was in clear violation of the
garnishment order. Given the expectation of such success, the Secretary believes the agency's litigation efforts
and costs would be minimal. Accordingly, this would be part of the agency's normal performance of its role of ensuring
the maximum collection of defaulted loans, and the Secretary may refuse to make reinsurance payments, or may recover
reinsurance payments already made to an agency that fails to sue an employer that was in clear violation of the garnishment
order.

: Some commenters were opposed to the qualified prohibition in the regulations that prevents a guaranty agency from
garnishing the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower
has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The commenters believed that the proposed regulations appear
to condone garnishment as long as the guarantor is not aware that the borrower has been involuntarily separated from
employment and has not been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. They believed that the HEA does not permit
garnishment under any circumstances until a borrower who has been involuntarily separated from employment has been
reemployed continuously for at least 12 months.

 All garnishments initiated by guaranty agencies on or after March 1, 1994 must comply with the standardized administrative
wage garnishment procedures approved by the Secretary on February 1, 1994. As part of those standardized procedures,
a guaranty agency must send a notice to the borrower prior to initiating garnishment. The standardized notice fully
explains the exception for involuntarily separated borrowers and includes a simple form for the borrower to fill
out to request this exception.

If a borrower who meets the conditions necessary for this exception wishes to take advantage of it, the borrower will
be able to do so quite easily, either before the garnishment proceedings are initiated, or during the hearing available
to the borrower. If the borrower chooses not to divulge information concerning an involuntary separation, and there
is no reasonable expectation that the guaranty agency should have known about the borrower's undisclosed involuntary
separation, the Secretary believes that a resulting garnishment of the borrower's wages should not be invalidated
if the borrower later contests the garnishment on those grounds or if the agency later learns that the borrower would
have been eligible for the exception.

The regulations require a guaranty agency to provide a hearing by a telephone conference with a borrower who requests
that type of hearing. All telephonic costs associated with the hearing will be the responsibility of the guaranty
agency. The Secretary believes this option reasonably accommodates borrowers who either choose to or who are unable
to attend an in-person hearing with the guaranty agency. The Secretary sees no reason to compel a guaranty agency to
tape the hearing, but would not object if an agency wished to do so. The Secretary does not intend to second-guess an
agency's decisions about wage garnishments on a case-by-case basis. However, if the Secretary learns that a guaranty
agency has failed to comply with procedures prescribed by the HEA and the regulations, or has failed to adhere to the
standardized procedures required of all agencies (see note included in the discussion for &sect;682.410(b)(10)(i)(G)
above), the Secretary will take appropriate action.

The commenters are incorrect. Section 488A(b) of the HEA specifically requires a guaranty agency to provide a hearing
upon a borrower's request, even if the borrower's request is not made timely. Although the agency is not required to
delay the issuance of a withholding order to the borrower's employer, the agency could do so, as explained in comment

(1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and discharge of loans due to death,

stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated
to repay the loan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the Secretary under the false certification discharge
provision of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment under this section only to the extent
that the loan is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally enforceable under applicable law by the holder of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative
tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment
that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant
to an objection presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset,
wage garnishment, or in any other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and
no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the
payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines
in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Death. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If an individual borrower dies, or, on or after July 23, 1992 the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies,
the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of
death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not
available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be discharged only if the guaranty agency determines that other
evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the
information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that
the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the
lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite
diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender
shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance
as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended.

Total and permanent disability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the lender determines that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged. A borrower is not considered totally
and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the
borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently
disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the
time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated,
so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation
loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans if the information
does not already appear in the borrower's loan file possessed by the lender.

(i) A lender shall comply with the requirements prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. In the absence of specific

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this

files a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the payment to the guaranty agency within
30 days of its receipt. The lender shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining whether the borrower

(i) The Secretary reimburses the holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after January 1, 1986, and discharges
a current or former borrower's obligation with respect to the loan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
(e) of this section, if the borrower's (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) eligibility to receive
the loan was falsely certified by an eligible school. For purposes of a false certification discharge, the term ``borrower''
includes all endorsers on a loan. A student's eligibility to borrow shall be considered to have been falsely certified
by the school if the school_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Admitted the student on the basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did not meet the applicable
requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit as described in paragraph (e)(13) of this section; or

(ii) The Secretary discharges the obligation of a borrower with respect to a loan disbursement for which the school,
without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or authorization for electronic funds
transfer, unless the student for whom the loan was made received the proceeds of the loan either by actual delivery
of the loan funds or by a credit in the amount of the contested disbursement applied to charges owed to the school for
that portion of the educational program completed by the student. However, the Secretary does not reimburse the lender
with respect to any amount disbursed by means of a check bearing an unauthorized endorsement unless the school also
executed the application or promissory note for that loan for the named borrower without that individual's consent.

Lender Responsibilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If the lender is notified by a guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it believes to be reliable
from another source indicating that a current or former borrower may be eligible for a discharge under paragraph (e)
of this section, the lender shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received
for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments) and, within 30 days
of receiving the information or notification, inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section within 60 days of being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection and shall be deemed to have
exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity.
The lender may capitalize, in accordance with &sect;682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The lender shall file a claim with the guaranty agency in accordance with &sect;682.402(g) no later than 60 days
after the lender receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section. If a lender receives a payment made by or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the lender files a claim
on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its
receipt. The lender shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining whether the borrower is eligible
for discharge of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The lender shall comply with all instructions received from the Secretary or a guaranty agency with respect to
loan discharges under paragraph (e) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The lender shall review a claim that the borrower did not endorse and did not receive the proceeds of a loan check.
The lender shall take the actions required under paragraphs (e)(8)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section if it determines
that the borrower did not endorse the loan check, unless the lender secures persuasive evidence that the proceeds
of the loan were received by the borrower or the student for whom the loan was made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).
If the lender determines that the loan check was properly endorsed or the proceeds were received by the borrower or
student, the lender may consider the borrower's objection to repayment as a statement of intention not to repay the
loan, and may file a claim with the guaranty agency for reimbursement on that ground, but shall not report the loan to
credit bureaus as in default until the guaranty agency, or, as applicable, the Secretary, reviews the claim for relief.
By filing such a claim, the lender shall be deemed to have agreed to the following_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower endorsed the loan check or the proceeds of the loan
were received by the borrower or the student, any failure to satisfy due diligence requirements by the lender prior
to the filing of the claim that would have resulted in the loss of reinsurance on the loan in the event of default will
be waived by the Secretary; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower did not endorse the loan check and that the proceeds
of the loan were not received by the borrower or the student, the lender will comply with the requirements specified
in paragraph (e)(8)(ii)(B) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that the borrower's request for a discharge has been
denied, the lender shall notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial and, if payments are due, resume collection
against the borrower. The lender shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest
from the date the lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance with &sect;682.202(b),
any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

for either acceptance into the educational program offered by the school or performance of the occupation for which
the program of instruction was designed to prepare the student.

of 10 percent of the borrower's disposable pay for each pay period or the amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless
the borrower provides the agency with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this purpose, the term ``disposable
pay'' means that part of the borrower's compensation from an employer remaining after the deduction of any amounts
required by law to be withheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's

to collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the
agency under terms agreeable to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph (b)(10)(i)(J)
of this section concerning the existence or the amount of the debt and, in the case of a borrower whose proposed repayment
schedule under the garnishment order is established other than by a written agreement under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(D)
of this section, the terms of the repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer for any amount that the employer, after receipt of the garnishment notice
provided by the agency under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold from wages owed and payable
to an employee under the employer's normal pay and disbursement cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from
employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of
the withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to
make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days after
a final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section must contain only the information
as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at the borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower
submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule.
The time and location of the hearing shall be established by the agency. An oral hearing may, at the borrower's option,
be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All telephonic charges must be the responsibility of the
guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(K) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty agency on or before the 15th day following the borrower's
receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue a withholding
order until the borrower has been provided the requested hearing. For purposes of this paragraph, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered to have received the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B)
of this section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency. The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing to the borrower
in sufficient time to permit a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to be rendered
within 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(L) If the borrower's written request is received by the guaranty agency after the 15th day following the borrower's
receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency shall provide a hearing
to the borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe,
may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the agency determines that
the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control, or the agency receives
information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. For purposes of
this paragraph, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a borrower shall be considered to have received the notice
described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of this section 5 days after it was mailed by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(M) The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the hearing may be any qualified individual, including
an administrative law judge, not under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(N) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than
60 days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages,
if the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the borrower due to the issuance
of a withholding order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) At least two of the collection letters required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must warn the borrower that
if the loan is not paid, the lender will assign the loan to the guaranty agency that, in turn, will report the default
to all national credit bureaus, and that the agency may institute proceedings to offset the borrower's state and federal
income tax refunds, to garnish the borrower's wages, and to bring suit against the borrower to compel repayment of
the loan.

(2) The guaranty agency shall retain records for each loan for at least five years after the loan is paid in full or has
been determined to be uncollectible in accordance with the agency's write-off procedures. For the purpose of this
section, the term ``paid in full'' includes loans paid by the Secretary due to the borrower's death (or student's death
in the case of a PLUS loan), the borrower's permanent and total disability or bankruptcy, the discharge of the borrower's
loan obligation because of attendance at a closed school, or because the student's eligibility to borrow had been
falsely certified by the school.
