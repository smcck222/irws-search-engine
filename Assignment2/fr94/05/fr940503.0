(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act. Section 1108(c) of Public Law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99&hyph;272 provides that the determinations made in this rule are not subject to the provisions for public participation
in rulemaking contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 1, 1994, the Secretary announced the national marketing quota and price support level for the 1994 crop
of burley tobacco. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Marketing Quota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 319(c)(3)(A)(B) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketing quota for a marketing year
for burley tobacco is the quantity of such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total
of: (1) The amount of burley tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase on
U.S. auction markets or from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the three
marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity,
if any, that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve
stock level. However, any downward adjustment in such loan inventories may not exceed the greater of 35 million pounds
or 50 percent of the amount which the loan inventories exceed the reserve stock level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 319(c)(3)(C) further provides that, with respect to the 1990 through 1994 marketing years, any reduction
in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceed 10 percent of the previous year's national marketing
quota. The reserve stock level is defined in section 301(b)(14)(D) of the 1938 Act as the greater of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 million pounds or 15 percent of the national marketing quota for burley tobacco for the marketing year immediately
preceding the marketing year for which the level is being determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S.
cigarette production and sales shall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the 1994 crop
of burley tobacco by January 15, 1994. Six such manufacturers were required to submit such a statement for the 1994
crop and the total of their intended purchases for the 1994 crop is 324.0 million pounds. The three-year average of
exports is 183.8 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national marketing quota for the 1993 crop year was 603.0 million pounds (58 FR 36857). Thus, in accordance with
section 301(b)(14)(D), the reserve stock level for use in determining the 1994 marketing quota for burley tobacco
is 90.5 million pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 21, 1994, USDA projected that the loan coops would have in their inventories 420.5 million pounds of burley
tobacco (excluding pre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred sales). Accordingly,
the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is a decrease of 165.0 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year is 342.8 million pounds. However,
the 1994 national marketing quota cannot be less than 90 percent of 1993's quota. Accordingly, the national marketing
quota for the marketing year beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1994, for burley tobacco is 542.7 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from
the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 1 percent of the national poundage quota for
the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments
for new farms. The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1994 crop of burley tobacco of 1,862,367
pounds is adequate for these purposes. In setting farm quotas for the 1994 burley crop, it was also determined based
on past practice that a factor of 0.90 would be used to adjust preliminary farm quotas to reach the national poundage
quota.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Price Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for
which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers, at a level determined in accordance with a formula
prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the 1994 crop of burley tobacco, the level of support is determined in accordance with sections 106(d)
and (f) of the 1949 Act. Section 106(f)(7)(A) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 crop of burley tobacco shall be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The level, in cents per pound, at which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 crop of burley tobacco was supported, plus or minus, respectively, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after
taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The average price received by producers for burley tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination
is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was
the lowest in such period, is greater or less than:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) The average price received by producers for burley tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined
by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year
for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year
in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by the tobacco producers
from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between the two 5-year averages (i.e., the difference between (A) (I) and (II)) is 4.7 cents per pound.
The difference in the cost index from January 1 to December 31, 1993, is also 4.7 cents per pound. Applying these components
to the price support formula (4.7 cents per pound, two-thirds weight; 4.7 cents per pound, one-third weight) results
in a weighted total of 4.7 cents per pound. As indicated, section 106 provides that the Secretary may, on the basis of
supply and demand conditions, limit the change in the price support level to no less than 65 percent of that amount.
In order to remain competitive in foreign and domestic markets, the Secretary used his discretion to limit the increase
to 65 percent of the maximum allowable increase. Accordingly, the 1994 crop of burley tobacco will be supported at
171.4 cents per pound, 3.1 cents higher than in 1993.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations governing mutual-to-stock conversions of insured
savings associations. The purpose of these amendments is to revise, clarify and update the current regulations to
strengthen the conversion standards and ensure the integrity of the conversion process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise and clarify the appraisal standards; prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies by management
of converting associations; place the current tax-qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) stock purchase
priority after those of eligible depositors; provide stock purchase priority to long-term depositors; require
that a stock purchase preference be given to eligible depositors residing in the association's local community;
prohibit management stock benefit plans in a conversion; prohibit merger conversions except in supervisory situations;
lengthen the conversion public comment period; require associations to submit business plans for all conversions;
prohibit the repurchase of a converted association's stock within one year of conversion; and make publicly available
preliminary conversion proxy materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to submit written comments on the conversion regulations, both as to the amendments
adopted here and the issues on which comment is specifically solicited and as to any other current provisions of the
conversion regulations as they relate to this interim rule.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has broad authority to authorize and regulate mutual to stock conversions of savings associations under sections
5(i) and (p) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1464(i) and (p).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For the past 20 years_since the OTS's predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) instituted mutual to stock
conversion regulations in 1974
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
_mutual to stock conversions have been a successful vehicle for bringing new capital into the thrift industry. Since
1974, over 1,000 mutual savings associations have converted to the stock form of ownership, in the process raising
approximately $16 billion in new capital.

While mutual to stock conversions provide an opportunity for thrifts to raise capital, they may also provide an opportunity
for an association's insiders to engage in transactions that transfer to the insiders an inappropriate amount of
a converting association's value. Thus, the OTS mutual to stock conversion regulations reflect standards and safeguards
developed over the years to maintain the integrity of the conversion process, to ensure safety and soundness by responding
to the potential for abuses in thrift conversions and to allow the conversion process to function effectively as a
capital raising tool.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS mutual to stock conversion regulations seek to balance concerns such as a fair opportunity for participation
by account holders and the desire to infuse significant amounts of new capital into converting savings associations.
In addition, the regulations are structured to assure that a savings association receives fair value for its conversion
stock and to prevent insider abuse by governing the manner and extent to which a savings association's insiders and
their associates, individually and in the aggregate, may acquire stock and other benefits in a conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent months, mutual to stock conversions have become the subject of controversy and negative media attention.
In particular, there has been controversy over the fact that some states offer insiders of state savings banks the
opportunity to gain potentially greater benefits and more generous compensation packages than are currently permitted
under OTS rules. Congress also has expressed serious concerns in this area. Legislation has been introduced in both
the House and Senate to address the issue of minimum standards for conversions by state savings banks and limitations
on management benefits in conversions. In addition, both the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the House Banking
Committee and the Senate Banking Committee recently have held hearings on perceived abuses in mutual to stock conversions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the OTS believes that its current regulations have generally provided sound safeguards for mutual to stock
conversions, the OTS and the FHLBB, in administering the conversion program, have refined the conversion regulations
periodically in light of experience with the conversion process and in response to developments in the market place.
As a result of the recent events concerning mutual to stock conversions, the OTS has again reviewed its conversion
regulations to assess whether additional revisions to its rules are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its review, the OTS has analyzed the changing financial condition of converting mutual associations. During
the 1980s, most mutual savings associations were marginally capitalized and many were insolvent. As a result, the
FHLBB undertook a number of regulatory initiatives designed to encourage associations to convert to stock form.
Many associations took advantage of these changes to recapitalize. Now, however, most mutual institutions in the
industry are healthy. Generally, these healthy institutions are not converting to meet regulatory capital requirements.
Instead, they seek to raise capital to expand their current operations through branching or acquiring other institutions,
to engage in new activities, through both the formation of a holding company and establishment or acquisition of operating
subsidiaries, and to establish stock benefit plans for management and employees. This change in the reasons for conversions
has caused the OTS to rethink the need for the regulatory inducements for conversion contained in the current regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing, the OTS has identified several areas of the regulations, discussed below, that it has determined
to revise, update and clarify to further strengthen the standards governing the conversion process. The OTS has consulted
with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') in developing these changes to ensure consistent policy
in this area. The OTS also has determined to adopt the amendments immediately as an interim final rule to protect the
integrity of the conversion process. As such, the final rule is designed to assure the public that the conversion program
will continue to be fair and equitable. Also, Congress has made it clear that it expects both the OTS and the FDIC to act
promptly to assure that any abuses or potential abuses in the mutual to stock conversion area are addressed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A. Revision to the Appraisal Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(1), a converting savings association is required to sell its capital stock at a total
price equal to its estimated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value, based on an independent valuation. When the FHLBB adopted the initial conversion regulations, it found
that underpricing conversion stock would result in ``windfall'' distributions of the value of a converting association
and that no method of conversion could be considered equitable unless the conversion stock was accurately appraised
and sold at its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value. This was necessary to assure that the association received full value for the conversion stock it distributed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations contain safeguards designed to enhance the accuracy of conversion appraisals. Under 12
CFR 563b.7(f), the OTS requires that the appraisal be prepared by an appraiser who is independent of the converting
association and who has expertise in the area of corporate appraisals. Although the conversion regulations have
been amended numerous times since 1974, the requirement that the conversion stock be sold at its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value has remained constant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The integrity of the conversion process rests, in large part, on the accuracy of the appraised value of the converting
association. It is for this reason that the OTS is concerned about recent conversions that have exhibited significant
increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market for the stock. Although some of these increases can be
explained by the high levels of speculation that have existed generally in the market for financial institution stocks,
the OTS is concerned that many of these appraisal reports may have set 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market values that were significantly below the true value of the converting associations. In such cases, the converting
association is harmed because the net proceeds from the conversion, and the association's capital levels, are lower
as a result of its stock being undervalued upon issuance. Conversely, insiders and other sophisticated investors
are able to accrue undeserved financial benefits. When this occurs, the independence and competence of the appraiser
are called into question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS relies on the independent appraiser to submit an appraisal report that is impartial, objective and arrived
at independently, without undue influence from the converting association or any of its other agents, including
its attorneys, accountants, underwriters or selling agents. The OTS is taking this opportunity to remind those persons
serving as conversion appraisers that the current regulations require that the conversion applicant submit information
demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the OTS, the independence and expertise of the appraiser.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In those cases where there appears to be a consistent pattern of undervaluation on the part of an appraiser, it may be
difficult for the applicant or the appraiser to establish that the appraiser has acted independently and in a competent
manner. In more egregious cases, the OTS also may determine to censure, suspend or bar an appraiser from practicing
before the OTS under the OTS rules of practice, 12 CFR part 513.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current rules, &sect;563b.7(f)(1)(ii) permits the appraisal report to contain a ``brief summary'' of
data that is sufficient to support the appraiser's conclusions as to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value of the converting association. Section 563b.7(f)(3), however, permits the OTS to request additional
information with respect to the pricing of the converting association's capital stock. In practice, the OTS, relying
on &sect;563b.7(f)(3), has required that a full appraisal report be submitted as part of the conversion application.
In that regard, the OTS and its predecessor, the FHLBB, have provided detailed policy guidance to the industry regarding
appropriate appraisal standards to be used in valuing conversion stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to eliminate any potential confusion in this area, the OTS is amending &sect;563b.7(f)(1)(ii) by deleting
suggestions that the appraisal report need only be a ``brief summary'' and specifying that a full appraisal report
is required. The revised language codifies the current practice of OTS staff requiring a more complete and detailed
description of the elements that make up an appraisal report and justification for the methodology employed. Because
a full appraisal will now be required under paragraph (f)(1)(ii), the reference to ``full appraisal'' in &sect;563b.7(f)(3)
is unnecessary and is deleted. The OTS expects that appraisals will continue to contain sufficient detail to support
the conclusions contained therein and that appraisers will deliberate carefully in the formation of an opinion to
arrive at a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 563.7(f) also has been revised to provide that in those instances where the initial appraisal report is deemed
to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, the OTS may deem the entire conversion application
materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, and in accordance with the OTS applications processing
rules, 12 CFR part 516, decline to further process the application. In such cases, the applicant will be required to
refile the conversion application, including a revised appraisal, as a new application and pay any applicable filing
fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current &sect;563b.7(f)(2), the fact that a person is participating in effecting a sale of the conversion stock,
either as an underwriter or as a selling agent, does not preclude such person or an affiliate of such person from being
considered independent for purposes of preparing the appraisal for the conversion. Although the staff has not experienced
any problems to date where a conversion appraisal firm or its affiliate have participated in effecting the sale of
the conversion stock, the OTS believes that it is essential that conversion appraisals not be tainted in any manner
by a real or potential conflict in such an affiliate relationship that would cause the appraiser to not be independent
in his or her judgments. Thus, while no changes are being adopted at this time, the OTS is requesting public comment
as to whether it should amend &sect;563b.7(f)(2) to prohibit an appraiser or its affiliates from also serving as an
underwriter or selling agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in order to further enhance regulatory oversight in this area, the OTS intends to issue updated guidance
for conversion appraisers that will provide specific details on appraisal methodology and report content.

B. Prohibition on Use of ``Running'' Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 563b.5(d)(4), adopted in 1985, provides for management of a converting association to use previously obtained
proxies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``running'' proxies, from a voting member. Previously, the conversion rules prohibited the use of ``running'' proxies.
The requirement was changed in 1985 to reduce conversion costs for marginally capitalized savings associations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 563b.5(d)(4), however, requires that each voting member be furnished a proxy statement on the special plan
of conversion meeting, and only allows for use of the ``running'' proxy in the event the voting member does not grant
a later-dated proxy to vote at the meeting called to consider the plan of conversion or attend such meeting and vote
in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, as discussed in section I. above, most mutual associations in the thrift industry seeking to convert are
well-capitalized. Thus, the regulatory rationale for truncating the proxy solicitation and voting requirements
generally no longer exists. In addition, depositors in greater numbers recently have expressed increased interest
in the conversion plans of their associations. The OTS believes, based on its experiences in this area, that the current
ability to use ``running'' proxies has lessened the incentive of converting associations to actively solicit depositors
to consider and vote on conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the OTS has decided to revise &sect;563b.5(d)(4) to prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies. The OTS believes
the prohibition is the most effective manner in which to assure full participation of the association's membership
in the conversion process. The requirement to use a proxy specifically designed for the conversion will require thrift
management to more actively solicit its depositors to obtain their votes for conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the last two paragraphs of Item 1 and Item 4(d) of the Form PS have been revised to conform with the revisions
discussed above. Finally, a sentence has been added to &sect;575.13(a)(4) of the mutual holding company regulations
to conform with this revision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under OTS rules, a conversion offering may involve as many as three phases: A subscription offering, a direct community
offering and an underwritten public offering. Only the subscription offering phase, which affords account holders
the opportunity to subscribe for stock on a priority basis, is required; if all of the stock is purchased in the subscription
phase, any other offering is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conversion regulations protect the status of mutual account holders by establishing a detailed series of subscription
priorities for purchases of conversion stock. Currently, &sect;563b.3(c)(2) requires that first priority to purchase
the stock issued in the conversion, after certain tax-qualified ESOP purchases, discussed below, belongs to eligible
account holders, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 depositors holding qualifying deposits at the savings association as of a date (eligibility record date) at least
ninety days prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the association's board of directors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations also provide that each eligible account holder must receive, without payment, nontransferable
subscription rights in an amount equal to the greater of the maximum purchase limitation established under the converting
association's plan of conversion, or certain formulas prescribed under the regulations.

In 1986, amendments to the conversion regulations were adopted to eliminate uncertainty on a variety of issues presented
by employee stock benefit plans and to enhance the ability of officers, directors and employees of a savings association
to acquire stock when the association converted, through various types of employee stock benefit vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to the 1986 amendments, the first priority to purchase conversion stock had always been with eligible account
holders. The 1986 amendments, which granted a first priority purchase right to tax-qualified employee benefit plans,
were based on the FHLBB's belief that acquisition of an association's stock by such plans provided a means for officers
and employees of converting associations to acquire larger ownership stakes in their associations upon conversion
without undermining the basic equities of the conversion process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, and perhaps more significantly, the FHLBB sought to afford undercapitalized mutual savings associations,
that feared hostile takeovers as a public company, a measure of anti-takeover protection through the opportunity
to place a significant block of conversion stock in friendly hands, and thus, encourage capital raising through conversion.

Section 563b.3(c)(23) currently provides an explicit top priority for tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans
that permits plans to purchase up to 10% of the total conversion stock offering ahead of eligible depositors. This
priority also is on a preferred basis; thus, in the event an offering is over-subscribed, the plans' stock purchases
will not be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the OTS believes that it is still appropriate to provide management incentives and to encourage employee
stock ownership in the converted association, these interests have been overshadowed by other factors. Because
most mutual associations are now healthy, there is a need to balance the interests of management and employees against
those of account holders by providing long-term depositors at mutual savings associations the first opportunity
to buy conversion stock. The OTS is therefore amending &sect;563b.3(c)(23) to revise the stock purchase priorities
so as to place eligible account holders before the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans and to place tax-qualified
employee stock benefit plans before supplemental eligible account holders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and all other voting members who have subscription rights. Finally, the OTS is amending &sect;563b.3 (c)(6)(i),
(c)(7), and (d)(4) to conform to these changes.

The term ``supplemental eligible account holder'' means any person holding a qualifying deposit, except officers,
directors and their associates, as of the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the OTS's approval of the application
for conversion. See current 12 CFR 563b.2 (a)(37) and (a)(38).

D. Revision to Eligibility Record Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the intent of the eligibility record date is to give long-term depositors a priority in purchasing
stock. It has been the OTS's experience, however, that converting associations have opted for the minimum 90-day
period for determining who is a long-term depositor. Upon review of this area, the OTS does not believe that use of the
minimum 90-day period is a meaningful indicator of long-term depositor status and should be substantially lengthened.
Thus, the OTS is amending the existing rule to require that the eligibility record date be set at a date no less than a
year prior to board of director approval of the plan of conversion. In so doing, the OTS stresses that the one year period
is a minimum time period; converting associations are encouraged to establish longer time periods to maximize the
stock purchase priority for long-term depositors. The OTS also is requesting public comment as to whether a longer
minimum time period would be appropriate.

E. Priority to Account Holders and Voting Members Residing in the Association's Local Community

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current conversion regulations require that, following the subscription offering of conversion stock to account
holders, all nonsubscribed shares be sold either in a public offering or a direct community offering giving ``a preference
to natural persons residing in the counties in which the association has an office.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the regulations currently permit a converting association to conduct a community offering of conversion stock
in the local community, prior to a general public offering. The current regulations, however, do not permit converting
associations to give account holders and voting members in those local communities a priority to purchase stock in
the initial subscription offering. The OTS, has, however, on a case by case basis, recently permitted thrift subsidiaries
of mutual holding companies to prioritize stock purchases in this manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon consideration of its favorable experiences with local community stock priorities in stock offerings of thrift
subsidiaries of mutual holding companies, the OTS now believes it is appropriate to require converting associations
to give the local community a more meaningful opportunity to participate in all conversions on a priority basis at
the subscription offering stage. Accordingly, new &sect;563b.3 (c)(2)(i), (4)(i), and (5)(i) have been added to
extend this preference to the eligible account holder, supplemental eligible account holder and other voting member
priorities in the subscription stock offering. The preference in each priority group will be to those persons who
reside in the association's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting association.
The term ``local community'' is defined in new &sect;563b.2(a)(19) to include all counties in which the converting
association has a home or branch office, each county's standard metropolitan statistical area or the general metropolitan
area of each of these counties and such other similar local area(s) as provided for in the converting association's
plan of conversion, as approved by the OTS. Current &sect;563b.3(c)(2)(i)&hyph;(ii), 4(i)&hyph;(iv) and (5)(i)&hyph;(ii)
will be redesignated as &sect;563b.3(c)(2)(ii)&hyph;(iii), (4)(ii)&hyph;(v) and (5)(ii)&hyph;(iii). For purposes
of consistency, section 563b.3(c)(6)(iv) is revised to conform with new section 563b.3(c)(2)(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, 12 U.S.C. 1464(b) and 12 CFR 545.11(b) establish that a federally chartered savings association may
accept and maintain deposit accounts within its discretion and subject to criteria established by the association.
The OTS solicits public comment on whether a converting association should have the ability to prevent depositors
who do not reside in the local community from participating in a conversion. In addition, the OTS specifically solicits
comments as to whether an association, in anticipation of conversion, should be permitted to: (1) refuse to open accounts
for potential depositors residing outside the local community, and (2) close accounts of depositors residing outside
the local community.

Under &sect;563b.3(c)(8), the amount of stock that officers, directors and their associates can purchase, in the
aggregate, is limited to between 25% to 35% of the conversion stock, based upon the total asset size of the converting
association. In addition, existing &sect;563b.3(c)(6)(i) allows any one or more tax-qualified employee stock
benefit plans to purchase in the aggregate not more than 10% of the total offering of shares and allows such purchase
regardless of the number of shares to be purchased by other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current OTS policy also permits management stock benefit and recognition plans (collectively ``MRPs'') to purchase

Given that mutual savings associations currently seeking to convert generally are well-capitalized, the OTS has
become increasingly concerned that the association's management may be undertaking conversions for reasons other
than the need for capital. Some thrift insiders may be sacrificing the interests of their associations and mutual
account holders to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits as cheaply as possible in the
conversion process. In addition, in some cases the issuance of conversion stock to a MRP lessens the opportunity for
depositors to obtain conversion stock. Finally, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than
at aftermarket trading prices, which in recent years has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates
the impression that management is structuring an excessive compensation package. While the OTS believes there are
valid business reasons for thrifts to adopt MRPs and stock option plans in order to attract and retain qualified management,
these plans are now more appropriately implemented subsequent to the conversion and with shareholder approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS is therefore substantially revising and codifying its policies regarding the establishment of MRPs and stock
option plans during the conversion process in new &sect;563b.3(g)(4). The new provisions require that any decision
to implement MRPs or stock option plans after conversion be voted on and approved by a majority of the shareholders
no earlier than the first annual meeting following the conversion. The rule further requires that thrift subsidiaries
of mutual holding companies obtain a vote of a majority of stockholders, other than the parent mutual holding company,
to approve such plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions also prohibit the use of conversion stock to fund MRPs, require that MRPs be awarded and stock options
be granted only after shareholder approval is received and require that stock options be granted at the market price
at which the stock is trading at the time of grant. In addition, any intention by management to implement MRPs or stock
option plans within one year of conversion would be (1) required to be fully disclosed in the proxy soliciting and conversion
stock offering materials, and (2) subject to the prior approval of the appropriate OTS Regional Director. Finally,
the regulation codifies the OTS's current policies regarding permissible amounts that may be included in stock option
and MRP plans formed within one year of conversion. Codification of these policies is designed to provide clear guidance
in this area.

In this regard, &sect;10(o)(8)(B) of the HOLA requires that a mutual holding company, which is generally controlled
by the management of its thrift subsidiary, must own more than 50% of its thrift subsidiary. Thus, absent a disinterested
stockholder vote requirement, management will be able to ensure approval of its compensation plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;563b.10, a mutual savings association may convert to stock form by merging with an existing stock association
or by becoming a subsidiary of an existing holding company. In this type of conversion, the account holders of the mutual
savings association, instead of being offered the opportunity to purchase stock of the converting mutual association,
are instead offered the opportunity to purchase shares of the acquiring stock association or holding company. The
structure of these transactions raises unique issues not involved in other types of conversions. These include the
adequacy of the consideration paid by an acquiror; whether a ``control premium'' should or can be incorporated into
the valuation of the mutual savings association; the treatment of the mutual account holders in connection with the
distribution of the acquiror's stock; whether mutual account holders should be able to purchase the acquiror's stock
at a discount and the amount of such discount; and the appropriateness of management compensation and stock incentive
packages offered by an acquiror to coax the mutual association's management into the merger conversion.

When merger conversions were first allowed by the FHLBB in the 1980s, they were perceived to be a useful supervisory
tool by which significantly undercapitalized or marginally capitalized savings associations could improve their
capital positions. In recent years, however, the OTS began to have increasing concern about merger conversions involving
healthy associations. In Thrift Bulletin 58 (April 19, 1993), the OTS established increased disclosure requirements
for merger conversion proxy statements to ensure that account holders received adequate and accurate disclosure
about proposed merger conversion transactions. In so doing, the OTS asserted its view that merger conversions provide
more opportunity than standard conversions for insider abuse.

In addition, there have been numerous complaints recently by account holders and others that permitting healthy
mutual savings associations to be acquired by means of a merger conversion has resulted in some thrift insiders putting
their self interest ahead of the interests of the converting association and its account holders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these concerns, the OTS recently imposed a moratorium on healthy savings associations entering into
these transactions. In its announcement, the OTS stated that the moratorium would not prohibit the acquisition of
an undercapitalized thrift by a healthy acquiror. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In undertaking the moratorium, the OTS noted that in many cases, management of the converting mutual savings associations
engaging in merger conversions were receiving extremely generous compensation and benefit packages. While OTS
rules limit many forms of excessive compensation in merger conversions,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there is still an issue as to whether management is opting for a merger conversion instead of a standard conversion
based on the best interests of the association and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to
management by the acquiring entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, the OTS policy statement on mergers, 12 CFR 571.5, in pertinent part, specifically provides that compensation,
including deferred compensation to officers, directors and controlling persons of a merging association may not
be in excess of that which is reasonable and commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The rule provides
that mergers will be particularly scrutinized where any such persons will receive a material increase in compensation
above that paid by the merging association prior to the commencement of merger negotiations. In this regard, an increase
in compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or $10,000 gives rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale
of control. See 12 CFR 571.5(d)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, merger conversions are perceived as being overly generous to the acquiring entities since they are essentially
able to acquire the mutual association at no cost. Unlike other corporate acquisitions, the acquiror pays nothing
for the converting association's stock. Rather, simultaneous with the acquisition, the acquiror's primary obligation
is to make an equity offering of its own stock to depositors of the converting association, retaining all proceeds
of the offering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS conversion regulations are based upon the principle that a conversion cannot be equitable unless the potential
for ``windfall'' gains is virtually eliminated. In a standard conversion, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
market value of the converting savings association is an appropriate means for determining the price of the stock
to be sold. In a merger conversion, however, the acquiring entity is obtaining control and should pay a premium for
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of the stock. In essence, the acquiring entity is obtaining control and receiving a ``windfall'' gain. As a result,
there is tremendous incentive for an acquirer to offer excessive benefits to the management of a mutual savings association
to participate in a merger conversion. Upon further review of this issue, the OTS has been unable to resolve the valuation
and ``windfall'' gains problem that the OTS currently believes is inherent in merger conversion transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS therefore has concluded that in nonsupervisory cases, there should be a two step process. The account holders
at the mutual association should be given the opportunity to purchase stock in a mutual to stock conversion. This assures
the account holders that they will have the opportunity to more directly participate in any appreciation of the converting
association's stock price following the conversion. After the conversion to stock form, stockholders can vote on
whether to merge with another institution, subject to the rules governing post-conversion transactions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the reasons described above, the OTS has determined to amend its conversion regulations to limit merger conversions
to supervisory cases. As noted earlier, merger conversions may serve a useful purpose in those cases where a savings
association is unable to convert on a stand alone basis because of its weak financial condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While eliminating the authority for nonsupervisory merger conversions in the interim final rule, the OTS is soliciting
comment as to whether merger conversions involving healthy savings associations should be permitted in the future,
and if so, under what circumstances. In particular, the OTS is interested in receiving comments on how merger conversions
could be structured to avoid the problems discussed above, including the problems associated with valuation issues.

H. Extension of the Conversion Public Comment Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 563b.4(b)(1) requires a conversion applicant to publish, in writing, a notice of the filing of an application.
Pursuant to the rule, written comments, including objections to the plan of conversion and materials supporting
the objections, from any member of the applicant or aggrieved person will be considered by the OTS if filed within ten
business days after the date of this notice. Failure to provide the written comments within the ten day period may preclude
the pursuit of any administrative or judicial remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depositors of converting associations and community groups have become increasingly interested in expressing
their views on proposed conversions, usually through the public comment process. In this regard, the current ten
day comment period may not be sufficient time for interested parties to review and comment on a detailed conversion
application. Thus, the OTS is revising &sect;563b.4(b)(1) to conform the public comment period in the conversion
regulations with the longer twenty calendar day public comment period provided under the acquisition of control
regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revision also would permit the OTS, in its discretion and upon written request, to extend the twenty day comment
period for an additional twenty days. The OTS believes that this revision will give interested parties a more meaningful
opportunity to express their views on a proposed conversion transaction. In so doing, the OTS does not believe this
requirement will impose an undue burden, since most converting associations undertake holding company conversions,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
where a holding company is being formed in the transaction, and are subject to the time periods under the acquisition
of control regulations.

The OTS conversion regulations do not require business plans in standard mutual to stock conversion transactions.
The OTS acquisition of control regulations, however, do require a consolidated business plan conforming to the requirements
set by the Regional Director to be included in holding company conversions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

currently file a business plan.

The OTS believes that all converting associations should be required to demonstrate how they will prudently deploy
and utilize the conversion proceeds. Therefore, the exhibits portion of the conversion application form, Form AC,
is being amended to require a new Exhibit 8, a consolidated business plan subject to approval by the Regional Director.
Also, in response to the OTS's experience that a number of associations have recently submitted business plans that
do not adequately address the deployment of conversion proceeds, the new Exhibit 8 includes a requirement that each
converting association provide, as part of the business plan submitted with the application for conversion, a detailed
discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion will be utilized. If the plan is to be treated confidentially,
the applicant should follow the procedures set forth at &sect;563b.4(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The capital distributions regulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and &sect;563b.3(g)(3) of the conversion regulations provide that a well capitalized converted association can
repurchase its capital stock, within certain limits and restrictions, by filing with the Regional Director an open-market
stock repurchase program for no more than 5% of the association's outstanding capital stock during a six month period.
This provision is in essence a safe harbor, provided an institution is well capitalized.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 563b.3(g)(3) also provides that OTS may object to proposed repurchases fitting within the safe harbor if
the repurchases would adversely affect the financial condition of the thrift.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Provided the safe harbor is met, a converted association can, under current rules, buy back up to 30% of the stock sold
in the conversion within three years of conversion.

The agency's experience has been that many associations begin substantial buyback programs immediately following
their conversions. While OTS believes that stock repurchase programs may serve valid business purposes, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., maintaining the value of a converting institution's stock in an active trading market, the OTS has concerns that
substantial buyback programs begun immediately after conversion may not have a valid business purpose. In addition,
repurchases begun immediately after conversion raise substantial issues regarding whether conversion stock has
been appropriately valued.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address these concerns, Form AC has been revised to now require that each converting association provide, as part
of the business plan submitted with the application for conversion, a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired
in the conversion will be utilized, including, among other things, any proposed stock repurchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the OTS is revising &sect;563b.3(g)(3) to prohibit stock repurchases for one year following conversion. After
one year, a recently converted association may file with the appropriate Regional Director an open-market repurchase
program in which it can request stock repurchases of no more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock during any twelve
month period within the following two years. In addition to the current standards governing permissible repurchases,
the Regional Director can now disapprove repurchases if the association does not demonstrate a valid business purpose
for the stock repurchase. The regulation, however, will permit the Regional Director to approve amounts greater
than 5% in the second and third years if there are circumstances that would justify such repurchases. Section 563b.3(g)(1)(iii)
has been deleted to conform with this revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS also is soliciting comments as to whether the current requirements of the capital distributions regulations
governing the ``upstreaming'' of conversion proceeds to holding companies formed by converting institutions should
be revised to further restrict the upstreaming of substantial amounts of the conversion proceeds soon after the conversion.

1. Subscription Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conversion regulations require that prior to the completion of a conversion, no person may transfer, or enter
into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of conversion subscription rights,
or the underlying securities to the account of another.

The OTS notes that the FDIC and others have recently suggested that it may be appropriate for depositors to be able to
transfer and sell their subscription rights so that any ``windfall'' value can be distributed directly to the depositors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, the OTS believes that this type of change to the current conversion regulations would raise a number
of novel and complex legal and policy issues, many of which were taken into account previously by the FHLBB in determining
to prohibit transferability. These issues include the possibility of adverse federal tax consequences to depositors
receiving such rights, undue pressure on mutual associations to convert that may evolve from significant shifts
of savings funds by depositors into such associations, difficulties in equitably allocating such subscription
rights among depositors, potential manipulation of the process by sophisticated third parties to the detriment
of the depositors, incentives for manipulation by insiders, the continued need for establishment and maintenance
of a liquidation account,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and significantly increased conversion costs due to compliance with securities laws requirements for registering
subscription rights for public distribution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations require that a converting association establish and maintain a liquidation account for the benefit
of eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders in an amount equal to the association's net
worth at the date of conversion. Each eligible account holder is deemed to have a pro rata inchoate interest in the liquidation
account. In the event of a complete liquidation of the association, an account holder's interest may not be increased
after conversion, but may be reduced by any subsequent decrease in the account holder's savings account balance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS believes these issues must be carefully analyzed before considering regulatory changes in this area. Therefore,
the OTS is not proposing any change at this time that would allow for the transfer or sale of subscription rights, but
is requesting comment on whether subscription rights should continue to be nontransferable, or if transferability
is recommended, the reasons for, and the manner in which to allow for, such transfer.

2. Availability of Conversion Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conversion regulations, since adoption in 1974, have prohibited the placing of copies of preliminary conversion
stock offering and proxy soliciting materials in the OTS public files. The OTS has noted, over the past few years, an
increasing interest shown by account holders, the public and the media in the information contained in those portions
of an application for conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS believes that even though this information is preliminary in nature, it may be useful for account holders and
the public to access it earlier in the conversion process. The OTS, therefore, is revising &sect;563b.4(c) to eliminate
the automatic confidential treatment that has been afforded this information in the past. The revision will permit
the public to have ready access to all relevant materials regarding proposed conversion transactions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants will have the ability to request confidential treatment of any portion of these materials by following
the confidential treatment procedures contained in section 563b.4(c).

 This revision augments the amount of information regarding conversions currently required to be made public by converting
associations. Section 563b.4(a)(3)(i) requires that, promptly after adoption of a plan of conversion by its board
of directors, a converting association must notify its members, and make copies of the adopted plan of conversion
available for inspection by its members at each office of the savings association. Section 563b.4(a)(3)(ii) also
allows a converting association to issue a press release announcing the conversion.

Regulations and Other Technical Changes

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, generally incorporate the substantive and procedural standards
for conversion contained in the conversion regulations. To the extent the interim final rule addresses conversion
standards, those same standards apply to mutual holding company transactions. Thus, the OTS is also revising 12 CFR
part 575 to make clarifying and conforming changes to those regulations to reflect the changes being made to 12 CFR
part 563b. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

V. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has determined that the interim final regulation does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action''
for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, OTS has found good cause to dispense with both prior notice and comment on this interim final
rule and with a 30-day delay of its effective date in light of the critical need to ensure an equitable conversion process
while still providing converting associations access to the capital markets. The OTS has a number of conversion applications
pending and it expects that it will receive significantly more in the next few weeks. Unless these revisions are implemented
immediately, associations will be able to avoid compliance with the new rules by filing and attempting to obtain approval
of their conversion applications before the new rules become effective. If the OTS were to proceed with a notice of
proposed rulemaking, the only practical solution to this problem would be to impose an administrative moratorium
on all conversions until the rulemaking process is complete. That type of rulemaking process would take a minimum
of several months. The result would thus be to preclude converting savings associations from raising additional
capital at a time when the capital markets are receptive to capital stock offerings by financial institutions. Should
the capital markets become less favorable, such a delay could prevent savings associations from raising sufficient
new capital through a mutual to stock conversion. The public interest is served by encouraging savings associations
to raise additional capital because an association's capital is the financial cushion that protects the association's
depositors and the federal fund that insures the depositors' accounts. In view of the need both to ensure an equitable
conversion process and to provide converting associations with access to the capital markets without delay, the
OTS finds that good cause exists for dispensing with the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure
Act. Similarly, the OTS finds that good cause exists for eliminating the 30-day delay of the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised rules will become effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will be applicable to all applications pending or newly filed as of that date. The OTS generally expects converting
associations with pending applications to comply with the revised rules. The OTS may grant, on a case by case basis,
a waiver in writing from any provision in the interim final rule for good cause shown. The request for a waiver must contain
sufficient information to substantiate the justification for the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS, however, seeks public comment on the conversion regulations, both as to the amendments adopted here and the
issues on which comment is specifically solicited and as to any other current provisions of the conversion regulations
as they relate to this interim final rule. The OTS may modify the rule in response to those comments if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For management or employee stock benefit plans, the aggregate amount of such plans shall not exceed three percent

(vii) All such plans are approved by a majority of the association's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed
holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no earlier than the first annual meeting following
the conversion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) In the case of a savings association subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a
majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no earlier than
the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of
grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Prior to implementation, all such plans are submitted to the appropriate Regional Director for review and approval
in accordance with the foregoing standards. In connection with such review, the Regional Director shall consider
all relevant supervisory information, including, among other things, the association's capital level, operating
history and size of the association. The Regional Director may permit amounts greater than those specified in paragraph
(g)(4)(vi) of this section, provided that the aggregate limitations of paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)&hyph;(v) of this
section are not exceeded.

Director. The proposed plan of conversion and any comments will be available for inspection by any member of the applicant

(c) Should the applicant desire to submit any information it deems to be of a confidential nature regarding the answer
to any item or any part of any exhibit included in any application under this part, such information pertaining to such
item or exhibit shall be separately bound and labeled ``confidential,'' and a statement shall be submitted therewith
briefly setting forth the grounds on which such information should be treated as confidential. Only general reference
thereto need be made in that portion of the application which the applicant deems not to be confidential. Applications
under this part shall be made available for inspection by the public, except for portions which are bound and labeled
``confidential'' and which the Office determines to withhold from public availability under 5 U.S.C. 552 and part
505 of this chapter. Preliminary soliciting materials will be made available upon filing, unless such materials
are not otherwise available to the public and are bound and labeled ``confidential.'' The applicant will be advised
of any decision by the Office to make public information designated ``confidential'' by the applicant. Even though
sections of the application are considered ``confidential,'' as far as public inspection thereof is concerned,
to the extent it deems necessary, the Office may comment on such confidential submissions in any public statement
in connection with its decision on the application without prior notice to the applicant.

This action establishes Class E airspace at Belle Plaine, Iowa. The development of a new standard instrument approach
procedure (SIAP) at the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa, utilizing the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Very
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and the Belle Plaine non-directional beacon
(NDB) on the airport as a navigational aid has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending from 700
to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The area will be depicted on aeronautical
charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 21, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa (59 FR 8566).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. We discovered there was a minor error
in the geographic coordinates of the Belle Plaine Municipal Airport. In addition, there was a reference to the Belle
Plaine, Iowa, NDB and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, VORTAC in the official description, which is not required. They were corrected
in this document. Other than these changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace
designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Belle
Plaine, Iowa, extending upward from 700 feet above the surface excluding that portion which overlies the Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, Class E airspace. The development of new SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport has made this rule necessary.
The intended effect of this rule is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB or VOR/DME&hyph;A
SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 CFR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation
as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures
and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the
Class D airspace at the Kansas City Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri (59 FR 4608). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Class D airspace areas are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and
effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class
D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends the Class D airspace at the Kansas
City Richards-Gebaur Airport. On September 16, 1993, Airspace Reclassification discontinued the use of the term
``airport traffic area.'' Airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is an operating control
tower is now Class D airspace. During the Airspace Reclassification project, the Hillside Airport at Stilwell, Kansas,
was to be excluded from the Richards-Gebaur Class D airspace. However, it was inadvertently not addressed in the official
description. Hillside is a public use airport which was established in 1956 and serves numerous non-radio aircraft,
as well as ultralight vehicles. Under the rules prior to September 16, 1993, an aircraft could land and take off at this
airport without contacting the Richards-Gebaur Tower. Under the present rules, an aircraft operating to/from the
Hillside Airport must contact this Tower. The intended effect of this rule is to provide access for aircraft utilizing
the Hillside Airport without the requirement to establish radio contact with the Richards-Gebaur Tower. The coordinates
for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

This action establishes Class E airspace at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri. The development
of a standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri, utilizing
a new nondirectional beacon (NDB) has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200
feet above ground level (AGL) is needed. For aircraft executing the approach. The area will be depicted on aeronautical
charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at the Sullivan Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri (59 FR 4611).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as the proposed
in the notice. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground
level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Sullivan,
Missouri, extending from 700 feet AGL to 1200 feet AGL. The development of a SIAP based on a new NDB located on the Sullivan
Regional Airport, Sullivan, Missouri, made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this rule is to provide
adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB SIAP at Sullivan Regional Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
rule'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulation Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Form
8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. The
SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument
Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions existing
or anticipated at the affected airports.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined through testing that current non-localizer type, non-precision instrument approaches developed
using the TERPS criteria can be flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. In consideration
of the above, the applicable Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) will be altered to include ``or GPS''
in the title without otherwise reviewing or modifying the procedure. Because of the close and immediate relationship
between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs
are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists
for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States Department of Commerce, is today
issuing a final rule making changes to regulations previously found at 15 CFR part 7 pertaining to the operation of
the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). The NVLAP procedures are redesignated as part
285 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and are revised to expand the procedures to include accreditation
of calibration laboratories; update the procedures for compatibility with conformity assurance and assessment
concepts; assure consistency with relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) documents (e.g.,
ISO Guides 25, 38, 43, 58, and 9000); and facilitate and promote acceptance of calibration and test results between
countries to avoid barriers to trade. Provisions in this regard will facilitate cooperation between laboratories
and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, harmonize standards and procedures, and
establish the basis for bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST) is today issuing a final rule making changes
to regulations previously found at 15 CFR Part 7 pertaining to the operation of the National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP). NVLAP provides an unbiased third party evaluation and recognition of laboratory
performance, as well as expert technical assistance to upgrade that performance, by accrediting calibration laboratories
and testing laboratories found competent to perform specific tests or calibrations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Competence is defined as the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions set out in the NVLAP regulations and
to conform to the criteria in NVLAP publications for particular calibration and test methods. Specifically, NVLAP
accreditation indicates that a laboratory's quality system, staff, facilities and equipment, calibration protocols,
methods and procedures, records and reports have been evaluated and found to meet NVLAP criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accreditation is granted following successful completion of a process which includes submission of an application
and payment of fees by the laboratory, an on-site assessment, resolution of any deficiencies identified during the
on-site assessment, participation in proficiency testing, technical evaluation, and administrative review.
The accreditation is formalized through issuance of a Certificate of Accreditation and Scope of Accreditation and
is publicized by announcement in various government and private media. NVLAP accreditation does not imply any guarantee
or certification of laboratory performance or test/calibration data; it is solely a finding of laboratory competence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP accreditation is available to commercial laboratories, manufacturers' in-house laboratories, university
laboratories, and federal, state and local government laboratories. Foreign-based laboratories may also be accredited
if they meet the same requirements as domestic laboratories and pay any additional fees required for travel expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP is comprised of a series of laboratory accreditation programs (LAPs) which are established on the basis of requests
and demonstrated need. Each LAP includes specific calibration and/or test standards and related methods and protocols
assembled to satisfy the unique needs for accreditation in a field of testing, field of calibration, product or service.

Description of the Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NVLAP procedures are redesignated as part 285 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations; expanded to include
accreditation of calibration laboratories; updated for compatibility with conformity assurance and assessment
concepts; made consistent with relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) documents (e.g.,
ISO Guides 25, 38, 43, 58, and 9000); revised to facilitate and promote acceptance of calibration and test results
between countries to avoid barriers to trade; and to eliminate references to the NVLAP advisory committee. Section
D has been replaced with language essentially identical to ISO Guide 25. Provisions in this regard will facilitate
cooperation between laboratories and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, harmonize
standards and procedures, and establish the basis for bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements.

Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 27, 1993, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published a notice of proposed rulemaking in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 40087). A total of 11 letters were received: Four trade associations, three manufacturers, one government
agency, one laboratory accrediting organization, one testing laboratory, and one consultant commented. All eleven
supported the proposal, especially the changes in procedures that will result in achieving compatibility with international
standards and guides and broadening the scope of NVLAP to include accreditation of calibration laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other than recommendations to strengthen the national and international recognition of NVLAP accredited laboratory
data, the comments covered a wide range of suggestions made by only one or two of the respondents. Recommendations
are addressed below with a summary ``Recommendation'' and a ``Response'' for each.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One accreditation organization and one consultant suggested that NVLAP clarify &sect;285.24 Denying, Suspending,
and revoking accreditation, to specify the conditions for making a suspension decision vis-a-vis a revocation decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 285.24 (e) clearly states that invoking suspension or revocation ``will depend on the nature of the violation(s)''.
It is very difficult to be prescriptive because of the vast possible combinations of laboratory operations and deficiencies.
Selecting suspension action implies the expectation that deficiencies can be resolved before actual suspension
is invoked; additionally, if suspension is invoked, the expectation is that it will be rather short lived. Revocation,
in contrast, is clearly used in cases of more serious deficiencies that are not likely to be resolved. The return of
the Certificate and Scope of Accreditation are required under revocation; it is expected that suspension will be
short lived, therefore return of the Certificate and Scope are not required.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer and one laboratory suggested that NVLAP procedures should provide for an ``office of government
liaison'' to work toward reduction of redundant accreditation programs in the United States to save laboratories
the expense of paying for multiple programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although redundant programs and multiple audits cause confusion and added expense to accredited laboratories,
NVLAP has no authority to add a provision regarding redundant programs and/or multiple audits. The NVLAP process
is designed so that NVLAP itself does not offer a LAP that duplicates one that exists or could be offered by a public sector
accreditor.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One consultant suggested that although a definition is provided for the term ``Certificate of Accreditation'',
a definition is needed for the term ``Certificate'' as used in the definition of ``Reference material''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
See NIST Special Publication 260, ``Standard Reference Materials Catalog'', for definition and discussion of the
term ``certificate'' as it applies to Standard Reference Materials. Defining the term in the NVLAP procedures would
be confusing and out of context with its use.

One manufacturer suggested that part 285 should be referenced in &sect;285.6 NVLAP documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 285.6 (a) will be changed to include such a reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association suggested that NVLAP modify the definition for Authorized Representative in &sect;285.5
Definitions to provide an organization with more flexibility in naming an Authorized Representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section will be reworded to provide additional flexibility by stating that the Authorized Representative of
an accredited laboratory may be an individual who is authorized by the laboratory or the parent organization.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer suggested adding a definition for Competent to &sect;285.5 Definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of Competence will be added as ``the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions and to conform
to the criteria in NVLAP publications for specific calibration and test methods''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer suggested modifying the definition of NVLAP in &sect;285.5 Definitions to include its relationship
to NIST.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agree. The definition for NVLAP will be changed to state that NVLAP ``is an Office within the National Institute of
Standards and Technology''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association suggested changing the definition of Traceability of the accuracy_in &sect;285.5 Definitions
by changing ``primary'' standard to ``reference'' standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition is correct as written. Traceability follows a path which may include the ``reference standard'' in
the laboratory but, as the definition states, must be traceable ``ultimately to a primary standard''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association suggested that &sect;285.33 (k) Certificates and reports identify the type of laboratory
issuing the certificate and report (e.g., independent, manufacturer's, etc.). It is the belief of the writer of this
comment that ``in-house'' laboratories can not necessary produce ``unbiased'' results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change is needed. Information describing the type of laboratory accredited is provided by the laboratory in its
application and included in the NVLAP data base. However, the type of laboratory has no bearing on the accreditation
decision; rather, the accreditation decision is based on the judgment (using results from on-site assessments,
proficiency testing, and monitoring visits) that the laboratory meets all of the criteria established for a particular
Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP), independent of the ``organizational'' association of the laboratory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One consultant suggested revision of &sect;285.23(a) Granting and renewing accreditation to remove decisions
based on variations of compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Full compliance results in accreditation action. Less than full compliance can result in accreditation or other
actions depending on variation from full compliance in terms of deficiencies and the expectations of corrective
action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One consultant suggested that &sect;285.23(b)(3) Granting and renewing accreditation should contain a stronger
statement than ``reminding'' laboratories of their legal obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NVLAP has no responsibility or authority to do more than remind laboratories of this fact.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association and one laboratory suggested that &sect;&sect;285.32(a)(10) and 285.33(b)(2)(ii) and (iii)
be either deleted or limited to ensure that the requirement for laboratories to avoid undue or coercive commercial
or financial pressures on staff are not applied to the normal course of employer-employee and independent contractor
relationships of a manufacturer's in-house laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These Sections clearly avoid undue interference by limiting the requirement to ``pressures which might adversely
affect the quality of the work.'' Accreditation of a laboratory depends on NVLAP's confidence that the laboratory
will provide accurate test and calibration services. These services must no be degraded by pressures of any kind.
NVLAP cannot deal with degrees or types of pressure, only with the accuracy of data provided to customers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association suggested that NVLAP needs to clarify its policy for addressing the recognition of foreign-based
laboratories based on accreditation by a foreign government or accrediting organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The policy will be clarified by adding to &sect;285.11 Requesting a LAP a new paragraph (f) which states that ``consistent
with applicable laws and regulations, the Director may negotiate and conclude agreements with the governments of
other countries for NVLAP recognition of foreign laboratories. At a minimum, any agreement must provide that accredited
foreign laboratories meet conditions for accreditation comparable to and consistent with those set out in these
requirements''.

 NVLAP must get this information prior to the laboratory making any changes. The fact of moving or reconfiguration
of a laboratory could significantly affect the quality of its testing or calibration activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NVLAP accreditation does not limit the freedom of laboratories to offer services outside the scope of accreditation.
NVLAP only limits laboratories from claiming accreditation for services not included on their Scopes of Accreditation
issued to the laboratories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association asked that the regulation be made more specific in defining the meaning of ``staffing'' in &sect;285.26.,
stating that it is too broad.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NVLAP believes that there are so many possibilities regarding staffing changes that the reference needs to be general
so that an objective opinion can be made on the specific change proposed or made. NVLAP focuses on staffing changes
that could affect the quality of the testing or calibration work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One trade association suggested changing &sect;285.33 (1) Subcontracting of calibration or testing to limit subcontracting
to accredited laboratories only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section is in full conformity with international requirements which do not impose such a restriction. This is
partly based on the fact that no other accredited laboratory may be geographically available or willing to provide
the services needed. NVLAP believes that its procedures for subcontracting will ensure that the data provided by
the subcontractor will meet the established quality standards.

A trade association, a Government agency and an accreditation organization commented that &sect;285.12(b)(3)
LAP development decision does not adequately prevent a conflict of interest for NIST in making LAP development decisions
that could be in competition with private sector accreditation programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditions under which NVLAP establishes and operates accreditation programs is explicit and addresses the
conflict of interest question. NVLAP believes that the requirements followed in making a development decision are
adequate and that NVLAP has guarded against establishment of programs already existing or that could be offered by
private sector accreditors.

A trade association, a Government agency and an accreditation organization commented that &sect;285.18 Adding
to or modifying an established LAP should be strengthened to require NVLAP to follow the same requirements for modifying
a LAP as for establishing a new LAP. NVLAP should not add test methods without going through a full ``need'' analysis.

Every LAP is established after an exhaustive process that includes the determination of need. Changes needed by a
LAP sponsor, caused by standards updated by standards bodies, or due to revisions in regulatory requirements, must
be made expeditiously so that the accreditation program continues to meet the needs of its sponsor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One manufacturer and one government agency suggested that &sect;285.13 Request from a government agency be revised
to contain all of the information required from a private sector organization requesting a LAP (&sect;285.14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures to be followed by private sector organizations and government agencies are, of necessity, different.
Regulatory and public service program authorities are specified in laws and administrative procedures. Accreditation
requirements established by government agencies may contain the conditions noted in &sect;285.14 and are automatically
referenced in the specific authority establishing a laboratory accreditation program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP, however, agrees that the procedures do need to explicitly address establishing or modifying NVLAP LAPs to
meet the requirements mandated by the Federal Government including legislative action and/or intergovernmental
understandings or agreements. Accordingly, section 285.1 is revised to state that NVLAP will operate to accredit
both calibration laboratories and testing laboratories ``in response to (a) Mandates by the Federal government
through legislative or administrative action; (b) Requests from a government agency (&sect;285.13); and (c) Requests
from a private section organization (&sect;285.14)''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;285.11, Requesting a LAP, is revised to provide that following receipt of the identification
of a mandate for a LAP based on legislative or administrative action, the Director must publish a Federal Register
notice (1) stating the purpose of the LAP including the national or international need; (2) describing the general
scope of the LAP; (3) identifying government agencies having oversight; and (4) providing information to any interested
party wishing to be on the NVLAP mailing list to receive routine information on the development of the LAP. In addition,
&sect;285.12 is revised to provide that the Director of NIST shall establish all LAPs on the basis of need; and that
a mandate to develop a LAP by NVLAP will be interpreted as a defacto decision to develop the specified LAP, and a LAP will
be developed (or existing LAPs modified, if practical) following these procedures.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the context of the establishment of LAPs at the request of Government agencies, one manufacturer stated that the
proposed change to the NVLAP procedures does not cover: (1) Requirements for factory inspections as a part of certification;
(2) certification organizations; and (3) the need for a public review of the findings. Further, the changes would
allow the use of subcontractors who are not independent of manufacturers, employers, and distributors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No changes are made. The comments reflect some of the conditions of accreditation required by a government agency.
These kinds of conditions are normally addressed in gathering information leading to a decision whether or not to
develop a new LAP. The NVLAP procedures can not be complete in anticipation of any and all possible conditions required
by a sponsor.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three trade associations, two manufacturers, a Government agency, an accreditation organization and a consultant
each commented on the need for more specifics regarding international trade, international recognition of testing
and calibration data, and memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and mutual recognition agreements. Most letters contained
some reference to these issues, either pointing out the need for explicit language recognizing international trade
interests such as ``reduction of non-tariff barriers''; working to ``make the program more acceptable nationally
and internationally''; stating that ``it is of great interest to U.S. manufacturers to have U.S./EC recognized accreditation
for testing to European specifications''; and identifying the need to ``promote the acceptance of calibration and
testing results between countries to encourage international trade''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment was also made that the NVLAP revision should state that inquiries from other countries regarding memoranda
of understandings (MOUs) and mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) will be referred to the appropriate U.S. agency
to participate in any detailed negotiations.

 One consultant suggested changing &sect;285.22 Assessing and evaluating a laboratory to eliminate the suggestion
that NVLAP provides consulting or legal services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding consulting services, communications with laboratories are in the context of these procedures, none of
which provide for consulting services. NVLAP identifies the deficiencies noted; it is the responsibility of the
laboratory, not NVLAP, to determine how deficiencies will be rectified. Regarding legal services, NVLAP provides
guidance to the accredited laboratories on the conditions for referencing accredited status; this is procedural,
not legal advice.

 The language in this section clearly defines the goals and objectives of NVLAP. Methods for achieving these goals
and objectives are already contained in many other publications, including NIST administrative procedures and
various NVLAP programmatic documents.

in response to comments received as a result of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

that such changes should be compiled for use in discussions at upcoming ISO meetings related to changing ISO Guide
25.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One accreditation organization suggested that ASTM Standard E 1301 should be referenced instead of ISO Guide 38,
which is ``no longer a viable standard''; ISO Guide 43 should not be referenced because it is very general and being
revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Guides 38 and 43 served as reference to ensure that the NVLAP procedures meet all current international requirements.
In fact, the NVLAP procedures are more robust than the procedures contained in either Guide 38 or Guide 43. NVLAP is
committed to meeting international requirements for laboratory accreditation, therefore we reference the ISO
guides and standards. We also know that ISO ``equivalents'' are published by other standards bodies. However, we
do not plan to invest time in evaluating the equivalence of these standards in order to reference them in our procedures.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One accreditation organization suggested that the reference to ISO Series 9000 documents in &sect;285.4 References
might imply that NVLAP accreditation also conveys ISO 9000 registration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reference to the ISO Series 9000 does not imply that NVLAP is an ISO 9000 registrar. However, NVLAP accepts the statement
in ISO Guide 25 that ``laboratories meeting the requirements of the Guide comply with the relevant requirements of
the ISO 9000 series of standards including those of the model described in ISO 9002''.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because (1) participation in NVLAP is entirely voluntary, and (2) the changes are primarily administrative, affecting
the management of the program rather than laboratories seeking or holding accreditation. Further, the technical
components of NVLAP, that is, the specific technical criteria that individual laboratories are accredited against,
are not changed in any significant way by this proposal.

Description and goal of NVLAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) NVLAP is a system for accrediting calibration laboratories and testing laboratories found competent to perform
specific tests or calibrations. Competence is defined as the ability of a laboratory to meet the NVLAP conditions
(&sect;285.32) and to conform to the criteria (&sect;285.33) in NVLAP publications for specific calibration and
test methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) NVLAP is a process which:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provides the technical and administrative mechanisms for national and international recognition for competent
laboratories based on a comprehensive procedure for promoting confidence in calibration and testing laboratories
that show that they operate in accordance with NVLAPs requirements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provides laboratory management with documentation for use in the development and implementation of their quality
systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identifies competent laboratories for use by regulatory agencies, purchasing authorities, and product certification
systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provides laboratories with guidance from technical experts to aid them in reaching a higher level of performance
resulting in the generation of improved engineering and product information; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Promotes the acceptance of calibration and test results between countries, and facilitates cooperation between
laboratories and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, facilitating removal of non-tariff
barriers to trade and promoting the harmonization of standards and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(c) NVLAP is comprised of a series of laboratory accreditation programs (LAPs) which are established on the basis
of requests and demonstrated need. The specific calibration and test methods, types of calibration and test methods,
products, services, or standards to be included in a LAP are determined by an open process during the establishment
of the LAP (see &sect;285.11). The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) does not
unilaterally propose or decide the scope of a LAP. Communication with other laboratory accreditation systems is
fostered to encourage development of common criteria and approaches to accreditation and to promote the domestic,
foreign, and international acceptance of test data produced by the accredited laboratories.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is a technical amendment to the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs governed by 24 CFR parts 880
(New Construction), 881 (Substantial Rehabilitation), and 883 (State Housing Agencies). The amendment will conform
the special rent adjustment regulations for those programs (&sect;&sect;880.609(b), 881.609(b) and 883.710(b))
to the language used in section 8(c)(2)(B), by adding the phrase ``or similar costs'' to the list of substantial increases
in expenses, such as real property taxes and utility rates, that may result in the need for special rent adjustments.
The ``similar costs'' language appears in other section 8 program regulations (parts 882, 884 and 886), but was never
included in the regulations for those programs covered by parts 880, 881, and 883. This final rule will treat all section
8 programs comparably.

In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department generally publishes a rule for
public comment before issuing a rule for effect, unless to do so would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary
to the public interest. This rule is being published as a final rule for effect because the Department believes that
public comment is unnecessary. The amendments made by this rule are technical in nature, and conform the regulations
to the statutory language.

Other Matters

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental assessment is unnecessary, since fair market rent schedules is categorically excluded from the
Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424)
in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Any economic impact, whether
on small entities or large, would be beneficial, in that it would seek to compensate property owners for extraordinary
expenses incurred that are not compensated by the annual rent adjustments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically,
the requirements of this rule are directed to private owners of Section 8 projects and do not impinge upon the relationship
between the Federal government and State and local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. Nothing in this rule changes the amount of rent paid by tenant families,
which is based on the income of the family.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS SIROCCO (PC 6) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully
with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval patrol craft.
The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS SIROCCO (PC 6) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot
comply fully with 72 COLREGS, Rule 23(a)(ii), pertaining to display of a masthead light and a second (after) masthead
light on vessels exceeding 50 meters in length; Annex I, paragraph 2(k), pertaining to the vertical distance between
the forward and after anchor lights and the height of the forward anchor light above the hull; Rule 21(c), pertaining
to location of the sternlight, without interfering with its special functions as a naval patrol craft. The Judge Advocate
General of the Navy has also certified that the number of masthead lights displayed and the location of the other mentioned
lights are in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the number and placement of lights on USS SIROCCO (PC 6) in a manner differently from that
prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.

This interim rule amends the Postal Service regulation which prohibits the disclosure to the public of information
contained in Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent.'' The amendment will authorize
the disclosure of information from Form 1583 for the purpose of identifying addresses as Commercial Mail Receiving
Agencies. The intended affect of this amendment is to provide an effective tool in combating credit card fraud and
other types of consumer fraud.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs) are private entities which receive mail on behalf of other persons. Both
CMRAs and their customers are required to sign Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through
Agent,'' a copy of which is filed with the postmaster responsible for the delivery address. Under 39 CFR 265.6(d)(10),
the disclosure to the public of any information contained in Form 1583 has been prohibited.

The Postal Service, primarily through its law enforcement branch, the Postal Inspection Service, has been working
with the credit card industry to prevent credit card fraud. One form of credit card fraud consists of submitting an
application for a credit card under a fictitious name. Perpetrators of this type of fraud may use an address provided
by a CMRA, which often appears to be a typical residential or business address, as a means of avoiding detection. Credit
card companies have asked the Postal Service to help them detect such fraud by identifying CMRA addresses, and the
Postal Service has concluded that the identification of CMRA addresses would be an effective tool in combating credit
card fraud and other types of consumer fraud.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended by the interim rule, 39 CFR 265.6(d)(8) will authorize disclosure of information only for the purpose of
identifying an address as belonging to a CMRA, and no other information concerning CMRAs or their customers will be
disclosed pursuant to the regulation. Because the regulation will not authorize the disclosure of the identities
of CMRA customers, disclosures under the regulation will not invade the legitimate privacy interests of persons
who receive mail through CMRAs. The information will be disclosed primarily by means of annotations to the Postal
Service's Delivery Sequence File (DSF). DSF data, the use of which is made available to the public through authorized
licensees, contains delivery-point addresses, and it does not include the identities of individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of Form 1583 on file with the Postal Service are records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and
they are maintained in the Postal Service's Privacy Act system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery

, the Postal Service is adding a routine use to system of records USPS 010.050 which will authorize the disclosure of
the information that may be released pursuant to the interim rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act regarding rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written
comments concerning the interim rule. These comments will be considered before a final rule is adopted.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia's Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) submitted a request
to EPA to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment, and to approve
a maintenance plan for the Richmond area as a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 17, 1993, (59 FR 43609), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) proposing approval of the Commonwealth's
request to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment and its associated maintenance
plan SIP revision. EPA's rationale for its proposed approval was stated in that NPR and will not be restated here. However,
on January 31, 1994, (59 FR 4263) EPA published a NPR withdrawing its August 17, 1993 proposed approval and proposing
to disapprove the request to redesignate the Richmond ozone nonattainment area from moderate nonattainment to attainment
and proposed to disapprove the maintenance plan as a SIP revision. EPA converted its proposed approval action to a
proposed disapproval because review of the 1993 ambient air quality data monitored during the 1993 ozone season indicated
that the Charles City County monitor, located in the Richmond nonattainment area, had registered a violation of the
ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The ambient data was quality assured in accordance with established
procedures for validating such monitoring data. The VDEQ did not contest the registered data. Therefore, the Richmond
area does not meet the statutory criteria for redesignation to attainment found in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA.
The maintenance plan SIP revision is not approvable because its demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the
ozone NAAQS is based on a level of ambient ozone precursor emissions which was thought to represent an inventory of
emissions that would provide for attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, but which does not as evidenced by the ozone
violations recorded during the 1993 ozone season.

II. Comments Received on EPA's January 31, 1994 Proposal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Letters of Public Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received four comment letters concerning the January 31, 1994 action proposing to disapprove the request to redesignate
the Richmond ozone nonattainment area from moderate nonattainment to attainment and proposing to disapprove the
maintenance plan as a revision to the SIP. One comment letter supported EPA's proposal to disapprove both the request
to redesignate the Richmond ozone nonattainment area and to disapprove the maintenance plan SIP revision. Three
comment letters opposed EPA's proposed disapproval of the request to redesignate the Richmond area. The commenters
opposing EPA's proposed disapproval stated that that even though exceedances of the ozone standard had been registered
at the Charles City County monitor, the monitor is located in a rural location downwind of a more populated urban area.
The commenters stated that, based on meteorological data, the recorded violations were caused by a small portion
of the urban portion of the Richmond nonattainment area and are localized. The commenters stated that the rest of the
Richmond ozone nonattainment area should not be economically penalized by the disapproval of the Richmond redesignation
request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA's Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's response to the latter comments is that EPA has determined that ozone is a regional pollutant driven by several
factors including, but not restricted to, weather and climate changes and ozone precursors so that the effect of ozone
emissions are not localized. In light of this, and the lack of evidence that the violations in the Richmond area are
due only to localized emissions, EPA does not believe that it would be appropriate to redesignate as attainment portions
of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area. Such an action would not be appropriate unless it were firmly established
that, contrary to the bases underlying the establishment of the boundaries of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area
following the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, certain portions of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area do not contribute
to nonattainment of other portions of the Richmond ozone nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is disapproving both the request to redesignate the Richmond ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the associated
maintenance SIP revision, both submitted on November 12, 1992 by VDEQ. This disapproval will have the effect of retaining
the designations of Virginia for ozone found in 40 CFR part 81 (56 FR 56843) dated November 6, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action disapproving the request for redesignation of the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area and the
associated maintenance plan SIP revision has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional
Administrator under the procedures published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on U.S. EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action disapproving the request to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment
and the associated maintenance plan SIP revision may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

(k) The maintenance plan SIP revision, and request to redesignate the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area
to attainment were submitted on November 12, 1992, by the Department of Environmental Quality. These requests are
disapproved because review of the 1993 ambient air quality data monitored during the 1993 ozone season indicated
that a violation of the ozone NAAQS occurred at the Charles City monitor in the Richmond nonattainment area . Because
of the registered violation during the 1993 ozone season, the underlying basis of the Commonwealth's November 12,
1992 maintenance plan's demonstration is no longer valid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources
of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented
through regulations at 50 CFR part 641 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Those regulations set the commercial quota for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico at 3.06 million lbs (1.39 million
kg) for the current fishing year, January 1 through December 31, 1994 (50 CFR 641.25(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 50 CFR 641.26, NMFS is required to close the commercial fishery for a species or species group when the quota for
that species or species group is reached, or is projected to be reached, by publishing a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on current statistics, NMFS has projected that the commercial quota of 3.06 million lbs (1.39 million kg) for
red snapper will be reached on April 27, 1994. Accordingly, the commercial fishery in the EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico for
red snapper is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994, the end of the fishing
year. A vessel with a valid reef fish permit having red snapper aboard must land and barter, trade, or sell such red snapper
prior to 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the closure, the bag limit applies to all harvests of red snapper from the EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico. The daily
bag limit for red snapper is seven per person. From 12:01 a.m., local time, April 28, 1994, through December 31, 1994,
the purchase, barter, trade, or sale of red snapper taken from the EEZ is prohibited. This prohibition does not apply
to trade in red snapper that were harvested, landed, and bartered, traded, or sold prior to 12:01 a.m., local time,
April 28, 1994, and were held in cold storage by a dealer or processor.

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures contained in Framework Adjustment 1 to the Northeast Multispecies
Fishery Management Plan (FMP). NMFS implemented parts of Amendment 5 to the FMP on March 1, 1994, but delayed implementation
of some provisions, including the effort-reduction program, until May 1, to provide the industry and NMFS sufficient
time to prepare for this unprecedented and far-reaching change to the regulations. The effect of this delay is that
the first-year's effort reduction requirements are compressed into eight months with different impacts on different
segments of the fleet. The adjustment in the fishing year implemented by this rule will establish May 1 through April
30 as the annual fishing year for the effort reduction program contained in Amendment 5.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 5 to the NMFS on September 27, 1993, after
spending more than 2 years on its development. The primary purpose of Amendment 5 is to eliminate the overfished condition
of the primary stocks of the multispecies complex through an effort-reduction program. The effort-reduction program
consists of annual reductions in the numbers of days that vessels are allowed to spend at sea as a method to limit fishing
effort for groundfish. Vessels have a choice whether to fish under an individual allocation of days-at-sea (DAS),
based on each vessel's history of fishing for groundfish, or to fish under the fleet DAS option, wherein vessels must
declare blocks of time out of the fishery and lay over in port for a period proportional to the time fishing for groundfish.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published the proposed rule for Amendment 5 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57774), and informed the Council on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 3, 1994, that Amendment 5 had been approved. At that time, the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional
Director) indicated that the expected implementation date for the amendment was to be March 1, 1994. The Council immediately
realized that the implementation of this comprehensive amendment would require NMFS' starting a number of new administrative
programs. The Council acknowledged the procedural and administrative difficulties and stated that it wanted NMFS
to implement the effort-reduction program only when the agency was ready. The Council also communicated its intent
that Amendment 5's effort-reduction program be implemented on a full-year basis, rather than on a part-year basis
for the first year, and initiated Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 on February 16 to adjust the final rule for Amendment 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council is making this adjustment to the final rule for Amendment 5 (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994) under the framework
abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and contained in 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure
requires the Council, when making certain adjustments to the FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span
of at least two Council meetings. The Council provides the public with advance notice of both the proposals and the
analysis and an opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council meeting. Upon review of the analysis
and public comment, the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that the measures of a given framework adjustment
be published as a final rule, if certain conditions are met. The Regional Director may publish the measures as a final
rule, or as a proposed rule if additional public comment is needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Council began developing Amendment 5, groundfish stocks were overfished and the prospects were dim for improvement
without the effort-reduction program. Since then, the condition of the stocks has deteriorated to the point where
NMFS, with Council support, implemented emergency regulations to protect haddock. Each new assessment of groundfish
stocks underlines the urgency of implementing rigorous and effective management measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council designed the management program using annual incremental reductions in fishing effort. The result of
implementing the effort-reduction program for less than 12 months in the first year is that vessels fishing under
the individual allocation option would have their annual allocation compressed into eight months, while vessels
under the fleet DAS would be required to meet the annual time-out requirement over eight months, instead of the full
year. Since the vessels in the individual DAS category generally choose to be in that group because of their higher
allocation of opportunity than under the fleet group, the conservation benefits of the first year's reductions in
allocation would be negated if the same allocation were distributed over only 8 months, instead of 12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, vessels in the fleet DAS category would be disproportionately burdened if they were required to
declare the same amount of time out of groundfishing over 8 months, that they would have to take over 12 months had Amendment
5 been implemented beginning on January 1. Many of the vessels in this category ordinarily would meet their time-out
requirement during the first few months of the year when the weather limits fishing opportunity, or when they are in
other winter fisheries such as northern shrimp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further need for Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arises from the Amendment 5 requirement that all vessels declare one 20-day block out of groundfishing during the
spawning months of March, April, and May. Since NMFS decided to implement the effort-reduction program on May 1, that
requirement would be compressed into the month of May for the first year. As a result, at least two-thirds of the fleet
would be required to be out of groundfishing at the same time, unless Framework Adjustment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 were implemented. Many fishermen are unable to plan how to best use their time and resources during the required period
out of groundfishing given the relatively short notice, and the substantial impact that the sudden loss of two-thirds
of the domestic supply of groundfish might have on the processing sector and the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will adjust the rule implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort-reduction program so that each allocation of DAS (fleet or individual) is done on a 365-day program year beginning
with the first full year of implementation of Amendment 5.

Comments and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period following the approval of Amendment 5 and preceding the Council's formal initiation of the framework
adjustment, a number of individual fishermen, interested members of the public, and industry association representatives
commented on the problems with the current effort-reduction program implementation schedule. Since the comment
period had not begun, these comments were not tabulated; however, all comments were in support of the Council's expeditiously
making the adjustment that is contained in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period spanning the two required Council meetings, the Council received written comments from
one individual and two associations_the Provincetown Draggermen's Association and the Seafood Harvester's Association
of New York. Oral comments were submitted by three individuals. All of the public comments supported the Council's
action and urged expeditious implementation. No negative comments were received on the proposed action during or
outside the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council requested publication of the management measures as a final rule after considering the required factors
stipulated under the Framework Measures in Amendment 5 and providing supporting analysis for each factor considered.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) determined that the framework adjustments to the FMP that this
rule would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other
applicable law. The AA, in making that determination, has taken into account the information, views, and comments
received during the two public hearings and comment period under the FMP's framework adjustment mechanism as specified
in 50 CFR 651.40. Considering the opportunity for public comment at Council meetings on January 12 through 13, February
16 through 17, March 17, and April 6 through 7, and Groundfish Committee meetings on February 2 through 3 and February
24, and considering the need for immediate resource protection for the groundfish stocks, the provisions for continuing
evaluation of the adjusted measures, and the timing of the rule relative to the requirement that all vessels take twenty
days out of the fishery during May, 1994, the AA has waived for good cause the proposed rules and additional comment
period.

This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA finds there is good cause to waive prior notice under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Prior notice is impracticable and contrary to the public
interest because it would cause undue burdens on some members of the groundfish fishing industry and would further
delay full implementation of conservation measures intended to replenish groundfish stocks. Further, the AA finds
that the public meetings held by the Council to discuss designation of beginning and ending dates for the fishing year
for this fishery provided opportunity for public comment to be considered. The AA finds that under section 553(d)
of the APA the need to have this regulation in place by May 1, 1994, is good cause to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness
of this regulation.

DAS as calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section by 10 percent each fishing year, including the first year,
for the first 5 fishing years of the effort reduction program. Each fishing year shall begin on May 1 and extend 12 months
through April 30 of the following year.

has made a final determination on the appeal. Any DAS spent fishing for multispecies finfish shall be counted against
the Individual-DAS allocation that the vessel may ultimately receive. If before this appeal is decided, a vessel
exceeds the number of days it is finally allocated after appeal, the excess days will be subtracted from the vessel's
allocation of days in fishing year 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP
at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the AI was established by the final 1994
initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59
FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 2,333 metric tons (mt). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(8), the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has established
a directed fishing allowance of 1,400 mt, with consideration that 933 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed
fishing for other species in the AI. In accordance with &sect;675.23(f), this fishery begins at 12 noon, A.l.t., May
1, 1994. Because of the low directed fishing allowance and high interest in the fishery, there will be insufficient
time to collect and analyze catch data and take appropriate action to ensure the directed fishing allowance is not
exceeded. Therefore, based on the best available data, the Regional Director has determined that the Greenland turbot
directed fishing allowance in the AI will be reached by 12 noon, A.l.t., May 4, 1994. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting
directed fishing for Greenland turbot in the AI, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 4, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t.,
December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule amends the Department's section 8 regulations for newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated
housing projects to provide for the system of occupancy preferences in certain section 8 assisted housing authorized
by subtitle D of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Subtitle D allow owners of section 8 projects
originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families to provide preferences to elderly families in selecting
tenants for available units in those projects. Owners that elect to provide preferences to elderly families as authorized
by subtitle D also must reserve no less than a statutorily determined number of units for disabled families who are
not elderly or near-elderly families.

 in Certain Section 8 Assisted Housing,'' and allows an owner of a covered section 8 housing project to elect to provide
preferences to elderly families in selecting tenants for available units in the project, subject to certain statutory
requirements. An owner who elects to provide preferences to elderly families must also reserve a percentage of units,
not to be less than the percentage determined according to a formula set out in the statute, for disabled families who

Definitions for ``elderly families'' and ``disabled families'' are codified in section 3(b) of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937 (1937 Act). Section 3(b) was amended by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act. Where the definition for ``elderly
families'' has, since 1974, encompassed disabled families, the amended section 3(b) now defines ``elderly families''
as families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons at least 62 years old. Thus, under the revised
definition, a disabled person does not qualify as an elderly family solely because of the person's disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(b) defines ``disabled families'' to mean families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons
with disabilities. ``Person with disabilities'' is defined to mean a person who: (1) has a disability as defined in
section 223 of the Social Security Act; (2) is determined pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of HUD, to
have a physical, mental or emotional impairment which is expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration,
substantially impedes his or her ability to live independently, and is of such a nature that such ability could be improved
by more suitable housing conditions; or (3) has a developmental disability as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department's regulations for the terms defined in section 3(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1937 Act for the assisted housing programs are published at 24 CFR part 812. While the 1992 HCD Act amendments to
section 3(b) of the 1937 Act require changes to 24 CFR part 812, this rule does not amend 24 CFR part 812. The Department
will modify 24 CFR part 812 by separate rulemaking. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless the context indicates otherwise, reference to the terms elderly families, disabled families, and near-elderly
families in this preamble is reference to these terms as defined in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section
621 of the 1992 HCD Act.

Under section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as revised by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act, the term ``near-elderly families''

II. Eligibility To Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 651 of the 1992 HCD Act provides in relevant part, ``[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner
of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for occupancy, give preference to elderly
families who have applied for occupancy in the housing&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis added.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the phrase ``designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,'' the Department believes that
in using the term ``primarily,'' the Congress intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to either the section
8 units in those covered projects in which a majority of the section 8 units were designed for elderly families (i.e.,
seniors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), or to the section 8 units in covered projects where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a tower or a wing of a project,
but not just a floor) exists in which the majority of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section
651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families
(``covered section 8 housing project''), or section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in a portion of such project,
but only where the section 8 units in this project or portion of the project were designed primarily for seniors. The
preamble frequently uses the term ``covered section 8 units'' to recognize that there are partially assisted projects
whose section 8 units will be covered by this interim rule .

are 62 years or older.

It is important to note that the statutory system of preferences provided by subtitle D is only available to projects
which qualify as ``covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.'' The
Department points out that many projects which have section 8 assistance are not ``covered section 8 housing projects
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families'' (as defined in Section I.A. of the preamble, which follows),
and may not elect the subtitle D statutory system of preferences.

Subtitle D and these regulations define ``covered section 8 housing'' to mean housing that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) was constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), as in effect before October 1, 1983; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) is assisted under a contract for assistance under such section; and (3) was originally designed primarily for
occupancy by elderly families.

8(b)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in Effect Before October 1, 1983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated
housing. However, the system of preferences under subtitle D does not apply to all these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The programs to which subtitle D applies are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new construction and substantial rehabilitation),
24 CFR part 883; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial
rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 886.

The ``Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages'' (see 24 CFR part 886,
subpart A) involves only existing housing. However, the ``Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition
of HUD-owned Projects'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart C) involves substantially rehabilitated housing, in addition
to existing housing. Accordingly, this rule would amend subpart C of 24 CFR part 886, but only for projects involving
substantially rehabilitated housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other programs which may involve section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance, but which
are not covered by the preferences in subtitle D are identified in section 658 of the 1992 HCD Act. Under section 658
of the 1992 HCD Act, an owner of a project (or portion of a project) that was originally designed for occupancy by elderly
families, and assisted under the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) program, the Section 236 Mortgage
Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program, or Section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly
or Handicapped Program, may continue to restrict occupancy in such projects (or portion of such projects) to elderly
families in accordance with the rules, standards and agreements in effect when the housing project was developed.
Accordingly, under this interim rule, the subtitle D statutory system of preferences does not apply to newly constructed
or substantially rehabilitated section 8 projects with HUD insurance or assistance under any of these three programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department emphasizes that it is critical that a project owner understand the type of assistance a project receives
to determine eligibility under subtitle D and these regulations.

Although in this regard, the Department is aware of no Section 221(d)(3) BMIR projects or Section 236 projects with
Section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance. As such, by its terms, ``covered section 8
housing'' does not seem to encompass the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental
Projects program or the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program.

2. Assisted Under a Contract for Assistance Under Section 8(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects have unassisted units and assisted units. These
projects are often referred to as ``partially assisted projects.'' Because the statutory definition of ``covered
section 8 housing'' only applies to housing that is under a contract for assistance, the subtitle D system of preferences
would not apply to unassisted units in a partially assisted project. Additionally, nothing in this regulation establishes
a cap on the number of unassisted units for disabled families in a partially assisted project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this regulation does not apply to the unassisted units in a partially assisted project, this regulation also
does not relieve any owner of any project, including the owner of a partially assisted project from complying with
the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the implementing regulations
for these statutes, or any other applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, including the requirements of
the National Housing Act, with respect to the assisted or unassisted units. However, notwithstanding the foregoing,
owners may provide the preferences in accordance with this interim rule, with respect to the assisted units.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Originally Designed Primarily for Occupancy by Elderly Families
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final statutory requirement for qualification as a ``covered section 8 housing project'' is that the project
must have been originally designed for occupancy by elderly families. The statute does not define the term ``originally''
or define the phrase ``originally designed for occupancy by elderly families.'' However, the House Report offers
some insight on this subject. The House Report suggests that to qualify as housing originally designed for occupancy
by elderly families, the owner of the project must have expressed an intent to create housing for elderly tenants when
the developer negotiated with the Department for Federal financial assistance. (H.R. Rept. No. 760, 102d Cong. 2d
Sess. at 141 (1992).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the various types of housing projects covered by this interim rule were developed under several different
programs, and over a period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at the Department
which evidences the population group to be served by a project. In many instances, the application in response to a
notice of funding availability (NOFA) shows that a project was designed as an elderly housing project. However, an
indication of the population group to be served by the housing project does not always appear in any one document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included
disabled families, it is not always clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for ``elderly families''
whether the project for elderly families was intended to mean housing for the broader eligible category of families
(i.e., elderly families and disabled families) or for families who qualified by virtue of age alone. Further confusion
may be added by the fact that for most of the period when this housing was being developed, the Department policy required
all housing for the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to design a certain percentage
of the units to be accessible for persons with physical disabilities. Typically, these units were made available
to eligible families with physical disabilities, regardless of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in establishing whether a project was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families within
the meaning of subtitle D, two distinctions must be drawn: (1) The project was designed primarily for elderly families
(as opposed to non-elderly families); and (2) the project was designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors), and
not designed for elderly families under the broader meaning of this term, which formerly included elderly families
and disabled families.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recognizing all these factors, the interim rule provides for supporting documentation to be drawn from a variety
of sources. These sources are identified as being either ``primary'' sources, or ``secondary'' sources. The interim
rule provides that if at least one of the primary sources clearly establishes that a project was originally designed
for elderly families (seniors), the owner of this project may elect the system of preferences provided by subtitle
D. However, if another primary source establishes a design contrary to the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is a covered section 8 housing project, the owner cannot make the election of preferences
provided by subtitle D without finding support in secondary sources. Secondary sources may then, as discussed in
this interim rule, be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are no primary sources clearly establishing the original design of the project, then original design may
still be established through secondary sources. At least two secondary sources must support that the project was
designed as elderly (seniors) housing in the absence of primary documentation in order to establish such intention
for elderly housing. Additionally, in the case of conflict between primary sources, and the owner chooses to rely
on secondary sources, then at least two secondary sources must support that the project was designed as elderly (seniors)
housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary sources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Primary sources that would evidence that a project was originally designed for occupancy by elderly families (seniors)
include any of the following: the application in response to the notice of funding availability (NOFA); the terms
of the NOFA under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement, the loan commitment, the bid invitation,
the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing.
If any one of these project documents clearly evidence that the project was originally designed primarily for elderly
families (seniors), the owner would be eligible to elect to apply the system of preferences provided under these regulations
so long as the primary documents do not conflict. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secondary sources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, if primary sources do not evidence that the population intended to be served by the project were
elderly families (seniors), an owner may elect the system of preferences provided by subtitle D if the owner is able
to produce evidence from two secondary sources that clearly evidence that the project was originally designed primarily
for elderly families (seniors). Secondary sources include: (1) Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy
for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head,
spouse, or sole member is 62 years of age or older; (2) evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided,
such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated
with the Area Agency on Aging; (3) project unit mix with a higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a
secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition
(in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects
and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing
projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled
families]; or (4) any other relevant type of historical data unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the lack of uniform documentation, and the possible lack of distinction between: (1) Elderly
projects which are seniors housing, and (2) elderly projects which planned to serve disabled families equally with
seniors, make the determination of whether a project is a ``covered section 8 housing project'' a difficult one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is specifically interested in public comment on this issue, particularly with respect to the existence
(or lack thereof) of documentation that would show the original population group intended to be served by the project,
other types of evidence that might be considered, and how to distinguish between: (1) Projects for elderly families,
which included, and intended to include, disabled families, from (2) projects for elderly families which served
disabled families only incidentally.

B. Projects That Do Not Elect Subtitle D System of Preferences: Section 657 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department emphasizes that the system of preferences provided by subtitle D and these regulations is not mandatory,
and is available at the election of the multifamily housing owner. In accordance with section 657 of the 1992 HCD Act,
an owner of a covered section 8 housing project that does not elect to implement the system of preferences provided
by subtitle D would continue to provide housing for elderly families without incurring any obligation (beyond that
mandated by the specific authorizing statutes and any other applicable statutory requirements) to provide housing
for elderly families and/or non-elderly and disabled families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For covered section 8 projects for which the owner does not elect the subtitle D system of preferences, the new definition
of ``elderly families'' established by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 apply. Rather the former definition in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, which includes the non-elderly disabled families
in the meaning of ``elderly families,'' would be applicable, and elderly families under this broader definition
(i.e., elderly families 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
disabled families) would be eligible for units in these projects for which the election of preferences was not taken
to the same extent that such families were eligible before enactment of the 1992 HCD Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-election of the subtitle D system of preferences does not override any occupancy requirements affecting
covered section 8 housing designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families based on the authority of regulatory
agreements or statutory provisions governing the FHA mortgage insurance programs. By way of example, the enabling
statute for the Section 231 Program (``Housing Mortgage Insurance for the Elderly'') mandates that not less than
50 percent of the units in a Section 231 project must be designed for the use of elderly persons, meaning any person,
married or single, who is 62 years of age or over. Accordingly, not all members of the entire population group encompassed
by the pre-1992 HCD Act definition of ``elderly families'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
elderly families and non-elderly disabled families), are eligible for elderly units in Section 231 projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the pre-1992 HCD Act definition could make it impossible to meet the statutory percentage requirement
of the Section 231 Program or a higher percentage that may have been specified in the regulatory agreement or in other
authority. Therefore, owners of Section 231 projects (where the projects are also covered section 8 housing designed
primarily for occupancy by elderly families) who do not make an election to be covered by the subtitle D system of preferences
will continue to follow the standards of Section 231 of the National Housing Act and the terms of their regulatory agreement
or other controlling documentation in determining the eligibility of elderly families for occupancy in their projects.
This position is consistent with section 657 of subtitle D which provides that where the owner does not elect the preference
scheme, ``elderly families'' as defined by the pre-1992 HCD Act definition, shall be eligible for occupancy ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to the same extent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such families were eligible before the date of enactment [of the 1992 HCD Act.] (emphasis added.)''

III. Implementation of Preferences for Elderly Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An owner who elects to provide preferences for elderly families in accordance with section 651, and who can compile
and, on request, produce the required documentation to support a determination that the project was designed primarily
for occupancy by elderly families (seniors), may, in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available
for occupancy after the effective date of this regulation, give preference to elderly families who have applied for
occupancy in the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An owner of a covered section 8 project is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the
election of preference for elderly families provided by subtitle D. The owner, if challenged on the issue of the ``coverage''
of the project, must be able to support the project's coverage, and the owner's eligibility to make the election of
preference through the production of the supporting evidence discussed earlier in this preamble. (The owner may
be challenged by, among others, existing tenants, applicants for tenancy or HUD on this issue.) Additionally, the
Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the determination
of the project as an eligible project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of its ongoing monitoring
of activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair Housing
Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When establishing the preference for elderly families, an owner also must reserve units for occupancy by disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly, as explained below. In no case, may an owner evict, without good cause,
a family that is lawfully residing in a unit in a covered section 8 housing project to achieve the occupancy level that
has been determined under the system of preferences or the reservation of units set forth in this interim rule. (Good
cause would not exist where the eviction stemmed from the system of preferences or the reservation of units, or because
of any action taken by the Secretary or owner pursuant to subtitle D.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Reservation of Units for Disabled Families Who Are Neither Elderly Nor Near-Elderly: Section 652 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an owner elects to provide preferences for elderly families for admission to a project or a portion of a project that
is determined to be ``covered section 8 housing project'' in accordance with section 651, then section 652 requires
the owner also to reserve covered section 8 units in the project for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly
or near-elderly. The number of units to be reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly is based
on a calculation prescribed in section 652(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 652(b), an owner who elects to provide preferences for elderly families must determine the percentage
of covered section 8 units occupied by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on October 28, 1992, which
is the date of enactment of the 1992 HCD Act (the October 28, 1992 percentage). The next step is for the owner to compare
the October 28, 1992 percentage to the percentage of covered section 8 units occupied by disabled families who are
not elderly or near-elderly on January 1, 1992 (the January 1, 1992 percentage), in order to determine the highest
occupancy percentage of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in 1992. The owner must reserve the
highest occupancy percentage (either the October 28, 1992 percentage or the January 1, 1992 percentage), up to a maximum
of 10 percent of the covered section 8 units, for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute and these regulations, an owner may, but is never obligated to, admit disabled families who are not
elderly or near-elderly to more than 10 percent of the covered section 8 units. The actual percentage required is the
highest percentage in occupancy on the two ``snapshot'' dates in 1992 (again October 28, 1992 or January 1, 1992),
unless that number exceeds 10 percent, in which case the requirement is set at 10 percent. Thus, under the statutory
formula and this interim rule, if a project did not have any disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly residing
in the covered section 8 units on both January 1, 1992 and October 28, 1992, the owner would not be required to reserve
any covered section 8 units for such families. The Department believes that few, if any, projects will fall into this
category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the percentage of covered section 8 units required to be reserved may vary between 10 percent and zero, the Department
reiterates that the required percentage is not a ceiling, and owners are encouraged to reserve (or permit admission
to) a higher percentage of covered section 8 units for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly where
the need exists. Owners who choose to reserve (or permit admission to) a greater percentage of covered section 8 units
than the percentage which is statutorily required for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly would
not incur any obligation to continue maintaining the higher percentage (than statutorily required by subtitle D)
as vacancies arise.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating actual utilization of units reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, units
occupied by elderly families where a member of the family is disabled do not count as part of the required percentage.
Another factor to be considered is that the percentage of units which are reserved under subtitle D for disabled families
who are not elderly or near-elderly is not linked to specific units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since most elderly projects, even when designed for occupancy by seniors, have a portion of the units designed to be
accessible and usable by persons with physical disabilities, there may be a tendency to assume that these ``accessible''
units will be designated to fulfill the required percentage of units reserved for disabled families who are not elderly
or near-elderly. This is not the case. Disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly and therefore qualify
for the units reserved under subtitle D may have any one of a variety of disabilities, many of which will not require
an accessible unit. Thus, in determining whether a project has met its obligation under subtitle D, the relevant factor
is the number of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in occupancy, not the units in which they reside.
The accessible units may be occupied by elderly families, or by a mixture of elderly families and disabled families
who are not elderly or near-elderly. Similarly, a project may have reached its required percentage of occupancy by
disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, and have vacant accessible units. In such case, an owner is
under no obligation to offer these units to disabled families before offering such units to elderly families. However,
the owner must offer such vacant accessible units to current tenants who need any of the accessible features of the
unit before offering it to the first elderly or non-elderly family on the waiting list. In selecting from the waiting
list, the owner can give elderly disabled families who need the accessible unit a preference over elderly non-disabled
families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that when a vacancy occurs and it is a disabled family's turn to be placed in a project pursuant
to the preference system, the fact that the vacant unit may not be accessible, does not entitle the housing provider
to skip over the disabled family. Where the available unit is not accessible and the disabled family needs an accessible
unit, the housing provider is to accommodate the family, either by (1) making that unit accessible, or (2) by transferring
a tenant who is living in an accessible unit but does not need an accessible unit to the inaccessible unit and offering
the disabled family an accessible unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Secondary System of Preferences: Section 653. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the statutory system of preferences, if there are an insufficient number of elderly families to fill vacant
covered section 8 units, an owner may give a secondary preference to disabled families who are near-elderly. Similarly,
if there are an insufficient number of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly to fill vacant covered
section 8 units reserved for such disabled families, an owner may give a secondary preference to disabled families
who are near-elderly to fill those units. However, in the event that there are an insufficient number of elderly families,
disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, or near-elderly disabled families to fill vacancies that
occur, the owner must make vacant covered section 8 units generally available to eligible families who apply for housing,
without regard to the statutory system of preferences or reservation of units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute looks to the Department to establish a standard for determining whether there are an insufficient number
of families to fill vacant units subject to the preferences or reservations established in this interim rule. These
standards are already in place in the existing section 8 regulations. The interim rule provides that before an owner
can determine that there are an insufficient number of families to fill vacant covered section 8 units, an owner must
conduct marketing to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences (including outreach to such applicants)
in accordance with &sect;&sect;880.601(a), 881.601(a), 883.702(a), 884.226, or 886.321(a), as applicable. Additionally,
the owner must make a good faith effort to lease to applicants qualifying for the preferences (which must include taking
all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families), and not reject any such applicant family except
for reasons acceptable to the Department or the contract administrator (in accordance with HUD guidelines).

C. Waiting Lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners of covered section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, which are required
to have a percentage of covered section 8 units reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly
pursuant to section 652, or which have other units available to disabled families pursuant to statutory and regulatory
requirements (e.g., near-elderly disabled families admitted under the secondary preferences of section 653) would
not be able to use this interim rule to remove applicants from a waiting list. Moreover, an owner would have to continue
to select applicants for covered section 8 vacant units in accordance with current HUD procedures with the exception
noted below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures presently in effect provide that the applicant's place on the waiting list and the application of preferences
determine the order of selection for admission. Section 655 provides that the existing Federal preferences apply
within each group (i.e. elderly families, disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, and disabled families
who are near-elderly) to the extent that they currently apply under each applicable multifamily housing program.

However, under this interim rule, if the applicants at the top of the waiting list are disabled families who are not
elderly or near-elderly, and such disabled families currently occupy the full percentage of covered section 8 units
required to be reserved for them under subtitle D, the owner may, but is not required to, skip over the disabled applicants
on the waiting list, and select elderly families for vacant covered section 8 units. The owner would only be required
to select disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, and who are at the top of the waiting list for vacant
covered section 8 units when: (1) The number of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in covered section
8 units drops below the minimum required percentage, (2) the owner has adopted a secondary preference under section
653(a) of the 1992 HCD Act, and there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families or near-elderly disabled families
to fill the elderly units (in accordance with section 654 of the 1992 HCD Act), or (3) the owner has not adopted a secondary
preference under section 653(a), and there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important to note that some projects which do not have to reserve any units for non-elderly disabled families
under subtitle D may have disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on their waiting lists. If a project
originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families would not have to reserve any units for disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly under subtitle D, the owner would not have to admit such disabled families
on the waiting list to covered section 8 units, nor would any additional non-elderly families have to be added to the
waiting list for covered section 8 units. The owner would, of course, have to admit disabled families who are also elderly,
and provide such families with the same preference for admission as non-disabled elderly families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, an owner who has adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would admit, and give a preference to, near-elderly
disabled families, if there are insufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units. An owner who has
adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would also admit families without regard to age (including disabled
families that are not elderly or near-elderly) if there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families or near-elderly
disabled families to fill the elderly units (pursuant to section 654). An owner who has not adopted a secondary preference
under section 653(a) would admit applicants without regard to age (including disabled families that are not elderly
or near-elderly) if there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even where there are sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units, an owner may elect to admit disabled
families who are not elderly or near-elderly to covered section 8 units, and the Department encourages this voluntary
policy, particularly where the need exists and the units are available. Owners who choose to admit such disabled families
in excess of the statutorily-mandated minimum may do so without incurring any continuing obligation as such disabled
families voluntarily move out, and without losing their project's identification as a project designed primarily
for occupancy by elderly families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, when an owner's decision to provide preferences to elderly families under subtitle D would have an adverse
effect on non-elderly families on the waiting list, the owner would be required to notify those families of the new
policy and how this policy may affect them. The notification requirement would be triggered if the current percentage
of disabled families who are neither elderly nor near-elderly exceeds the minimum required percentage, and non-elderly
families on the waiting list (including those with disabilities) may be passed over for covered section 8 units for
the elderly, or if the project is one of the few which will have no units set aside for such disabled families under subtitle
D.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Justification for Interim Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Department's general policy to publish a rule for notice and comment before issuing a rule for effect in accordance
with the Department's own rule on rulemaking, codified at 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides for exceptions
from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good
cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is determined to be ``impracticable, unnecessary, or
contrary to the public interest.'' (See 24 CFR 10.1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this interim rule for effect without notice and prior public
comment because the Department has determined that, with the exception of possible clarifying changes at the final
rule stage, public comment will not alter the standards set forth in this interim rule for making the election of preferences
provided by subtitle D, and is therefore unnecessary. The interim rule adopts the standards for the election of preferences
for elderly families and reservation of units for disabled families as set forth in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle D establishes which section 8 housing projects are eligible for the election of preferences provided by
subtitle D. Subtitle D establishes that the ``elderly families'' eligible to reside in covered section 8 housing
projects for which the owner has made the election of preferences provided by subtitle D are those families who meet
the definition of ``elderly families'' as set forth in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section 621 of the
1992 HCD Act. Subtitle D establishes the formula by which an owner will determine the number of units in the covered
section 8 housing project that must be reserved for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly.
Subtitle D establishes the secondary system of preferences available to owners if there are insufficient numbers
of elderly families to occupy all the units reserved for elderly families. Subtitle D also establishes the procedures
to be followed if units remain vacant after the owner has elected to provide the secondary system of preferences, and
the procedures to be followed concerning the order of selection within groups to whom a preference has been given.
The interim rule adopts all these statutory provisions without substantive change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule departs from the statute in providing the types of documents that an owner must be able to produce in
the event the owner is challenged on the issue of whether the owner's project is eligible for the election of preferences
provided by subtitle D. The statute does not provide how the owner may support that the owner's section 8 housing project
was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., seniors). The interim rule provides
a list of documents which the owner may rely upon as support for determining project eligibility to make the election
of preferences provided by subtitle D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department carefully considered which documents may evidence project eligibility for the subtitle D system
of preferences. As discussed earlier in the preamble, because of the various types of housing projects covered by
subtitle D and this interim rule, and because these housing projects were developed under several different programs
and over a period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at the Department which
identifies the population group to be served by the project. Additionally, and again as discussed earlier in the preamble,
the difficulty in identifying the population group to be served is added by the fact that the previous definition of
``elderly families'' in the 1937 Act included disabled families, and the Department's policy required all housing
for the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to design a certain percentage of
units to be accessible for persons with physical disabilities. The Department specifically requests comments from
the public on the list of supporting documents provided in the interim rule, and this provision may change following
public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that there may be questions concerning the Department's use of interim rulemaking for
subtitle D of title VI, but not for subtitle B of the title VI. Subtitle B provides public housing agencies (PHAs) with
the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing projects, or portions of these projects,
for occupancy by elderly families, by disabled families, or elderly families and disabled families. Under subtitle
B, to elect this option, a PHA must submit an allocation plan to the Department for review and approval before designating
a project for occupancy by one of the three categories of families listed in the statute. Additionally, for projects
to be designated for occupancy by disabled families, the statute requires the PHA also must submit, and receive approval
of, a supportive service plan. The Department added requirements, by regulation, to the allocation plan and supportive
service plan to supplement those set forth in the statute. For this reason, it was necessary to provide the public with
advance notice and public comment before making those regulatory requirements effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, to the extent that this subtitle D rule, which concerns section 8 housing, and the subtitle B rule, which
concerns public housing, address similar issues, the public comments on the subtitle B rule are applicable to this
interim rule. Both statutes (subtitle D and subtitle B), which permit housing to be reserved for occupancy by elderly
families, may have the affect of reducing housing assistance for non-elderly disabled persons. Subtitle D attempts
to minimize the reduction of housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families by limiting the preference for
elderly families to covered section 8 housing that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.
Subtitle D also requires owners of these covered projects to reserve units in the covered project for disabled families
who are neither elderly nor near-elderly, and the number of units to be reserved is determined in accordance with the
formula established by the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle B attempts to minimize the reduction of housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families by requiring
housing authorities that designate projects for elderly families to submit a plan for securing sufficient additional
resources that the agency owns, controls, or has received preliminary notification that it will obtain, or for which
the agency plans to apply that will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled
families that would have been housed but for the designation of the project for elderly families. Further, both statutes
prohibit the eviction of any tenant lawfully residing in a section 8 covered project or a public housing project because
the project is to be reserved for elderly families or to be designated for elderly families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule were concerned about the possible reduction of public
housing assistance for non-elderly disabled families as a result of projects designated for elderly families, and
several requested that the Department not permit designated housing. The Department anticipates that persons with
disabilities will have the same concerns about the subtitle D rule, and perhaps make similar comments. However, in
both cases, the statute permits the reservation or designation for projects for occupancy by elderly families, and
the Department cannot preclude this an as option for project owners or housing authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule requested that the Department carefully monitor the
statutory protections provided for non-elderly disabled families. The Department anticipates that persons with
disabilities commenting on the subtitle D rule will make similar comments. The Department will monitor both the subtitle
D reservation, and the subtitle B designation, to ensure, to the extent possible, that there is minimum adverse impact
on non-elderly disabled families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons with disabilities commenting on the subtitle B rule stated that their concern about loss of access to projects
designated for elderly families should be construed to mean a concern about reduction of housing assistance generally,
and not concern about loss of access to ``elderly'' projects. These commenters stated that an integrated housing
setting is not a project that houses only elderly families and disabled families. The commenters asked the Department
to make available section 8 assistance to non-elderly disabled families so that they could live in housing with ``mainstream''
populations. The Department anticipates that similar comments will be made by persons with disabilities on the subtitle
D rule. The Department will make every effort to increase section 8 housing assistance for non-elderly disabled persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the statutory framework of the system of preferences for elderly families authorized by the subtitle D rule,
the Department reiterates that, except for the types of documentation a project owner should be able to produce to
support a determination of eligibility to make the election of preferences, there is very little that will change
at the final rule stage as a result of public comments. Given the similarity of certain issues addressed by subtitle
D and subtitle B, the Department also reiterates that those comments received on the subtitle B rule and that are applicable
to this rule were taken into consideration in developing this interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this interim rule is being published for effect within 30 days from the date of publication, the Department
requests comments from the public on this interim rule, and the public comments will be considered by the Department
in development of the final rule.

Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the interim rule is directed to owners
of multifamily housing projects, and will not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal Government and State
and local governments. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the order.

Executive Order 12606, the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
interim rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
within the meaning of the order. This interim rule implements the system of preferences authorized by subtitle D of
title VI of the 1992 HCD Act, which provides that owners of certain section 8 covered projects that were originally
designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., families whose heads, spouses or sole members are 62
years or older) may elect to give preference in occupancy to vacant units in the project to elderly families. Although
subtitle D provides for preferences for elderly families in projects meeting the conditions established by subtitle
D, subtitle D also requires that owners of such projects must reserve no less than a minimum number of units in these
projects for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. The minimum number is determined in accordance
with the formula established by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the subtitle D preference system provides a primary preference for elderly families, and a secondary preference
for disabled families who are near-elderly, there is the possibility that this statutory system of preferences would
limit the availability of certain section 8 housing for: (1) Disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly
(if an owner gives preference to elderly families for units), and (2) such families with children, and thus adversely
impact the maintenance and well-being of these families. (Although owners can apply the same preferences and reservation
of units to families with children as to families without children, owners cannot restrict admission to any units
solely because of familial status as long as the family qualifies for the unit on the basis of the relevant age or disability
criterion for admission.) The Department believes that the number of projects that would be eligible for the preferences
provided by subtitle D is limited, and thus, the impact on family maintenance and well being would not be significant
within the meaning of the order.

interim rule, and in so doing certifies that this interim rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This interim rule reflects a system of occupancy preferences authorized by statute which
applies to section 8 newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing without regard to the size of entities
involved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed
primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may elect to give preference to elderly families
in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the
owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an ``elderly project.''
``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.

occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility
of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of supporting evidence as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable

shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before
loan closing;

or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Secondary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has
been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation
to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage
of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects
under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly
families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible
units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly
families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted
by other comparable evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy
by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section,
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:

 Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before

or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Secondary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has
been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation
to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage
of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects
under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly

 If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

 (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed

of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of supporting evidence as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: Lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are
available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member
is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded
by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency
on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly
relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families
were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with
other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those
serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant
type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for
occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility
of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility
through the production of supporting evidence as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the
identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing
monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable
statutes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evidence supporting project eligibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy
by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section,
shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section,
or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary
source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding
availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid
invitation; the owner's management plan, or any other underwriting or financial document collected at or before
loan closing; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secondary sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two or more sources of evidence such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has
been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence
that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation
to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with a higher percentage
of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects
under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly
families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible
units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly
families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted
by other comparable evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sources in conflict.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would
base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election
of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where
the primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly
families, including those cases where primary documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the
use for which the project was originally designed.

Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1)
of this section for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families (hereafter, collectively
referred to ``non-elderly disabled families'').

Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families
than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly
disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families.
The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that
number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient
number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved
for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided
in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who
are near-elderly families.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the owner of an elderly project who has elected to adopt the secondary preferences in paragraph (d) of this section
determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of families for
whom preference, including secondary preference, in occupancy has been given, to fill all the vacant units in the
elderly project, the owner shall make the vacant units generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply
for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including
secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with &sect;886.321(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An owner that gives preferences to elderly families and reserves units for non-elderly disabled families in accordance
with this section also shall select applicants among each respective group in accordance with the Federal preferences
contained in &sect;886.337.
