SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's regulations currently require that independent reviews and audits of each licensee's safeguards
contingency plan and security program be conducted every 12 months by personnel who have no direct responsibility
for the subject areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is considering rulemaking in several program areas that would modify audit requirements so that the frequency,
scope, and depth of auditing activities would be based on review of program performance indicators but would not exceed
a 36-month interval to accomplish an audit of all program elements. Final NRC action on this petition would be consistent
with actions taken on modifications to other program audit requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner's Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia Power requests that the NRC amend its regulations in 10 CFR parts 50 and 73 to change the requirements that
each licensee provide for a review at least every 12 months (annually) of its safeguards contingency plan and security
programs to nominally every 24 months (biennially). The petitioner also requests that appendix C to 10 CFR part 73
be amended to change the requirement that each licensee provide for a review and audit of its safeguards contingency
plan at intervals not to exceed 12 months to a frequency of 24 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the proposed amendments would require each licensee to conduct independent reviews and
audits of its safeguards contingency plan and security program at least biennially. The petitioner states that the
resources presently used for audits in each area could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated if justified by performance to address more safety-significant concerns that might be identified.
The petitioner also states that the proposed audit frequency provides a greater degree of flexibility in applying
resources, thereby permitting a licensee to implement a more performance-based audit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Grounds for Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the changes requested are identified as present requirements that are resource intensive
but of marginal importance to safety. The petitioner offers the following reasons for the request.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The underlying purpose of the requirements is to overview and ensure effective implementation of security programs.
Given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available objective criteria that industry performance is commendable in this area, aggressive overview activities
do not seem to be warranted. Resources, which previously would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strictly dedicated to the conduct of mandatory audits, could now be more effectively used to address performance
issues having safety significance. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an acceptable, formal confirmation
of security program implementation. The underlying purpose of the existing requirement will continue to be met by
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The current industry Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) average for the security category
is 1.27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of October 15, 1993. Clearly, this represents a commendable overall performance in this area and supports the move
to biennial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits which can be supplemented as performance warrants. Based on the overall industry SALP ratings concerning
safeguards contingency plan and security program effectiveness, Virginia Power concludes that changing the audit
frequency to two years will have no adverse impact on implementation of the plan and program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A two-year audit schedule would permit the licensee an increased degree of flexibility to concentrate available
audit resources in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of observed weakness based on performance rather than conducting a mandatory annual audit of marginal safety
significance. Thus, personnel resources would be allowed to address and resolve issues having greater safety significance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Regulatory Guide 1.33, Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation), prescribes a two-year audit frequency
for most operational phase activities commensurate with the activity's operational safety significance. The proposed
rule would be consistent with this previously defined regulatory position and the present safety significance as
evidenced by industry performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The requirements to conduct annual audits are not of themselves necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of
10 CFR 50.54(p) and 10 CFR part 73. Biennial audits are sufficient to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable formal confirmation of program effectiveness.

Supporting Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the regulations that require licensees to implement safeguards contingency plans and
security programs are essential to ensure operation of the facilities in an environment free from external threats.
The petitioner notes that independent audits of these programs are required to overview their effectiveness. Furthermore,
the petitioner believes that the frequency or extent of overview of these plans and programs by mandatory audits is
not providing a commensurate performance in security programs. According to the petitioner, safeguards contingency
plans and security programs have been in place in the industry for an extended period and that despite recent reconsideration
of the design basis threat, nuclear security is otherwise being adequately addressed and implemented by the plans
and programs as they are presently configured. The petitioner believes that a biennial audit frequency would more
than adequately provide the requisite feedback and assurance regarding the effectiveness of each licensee's safeguards
contingency plan and security program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner further states that technological advancements and applications have resulted in and will continue
to generate improvements to security equipment and facilities. The petitioner asserts that industry-wide programmatic
enhancements continue to be made available to improve the effective utilization of security staff as well as equipment
and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of the improvements to equipment and facilities and programmatic enhancements within nuclear safeguards
and security programs over the past decade have elevated plan effectiveness throughout the industry. The petitioner
notes that the improvement is evidenced, in part, through the SALP program which is used to assess security indicators.

(3) The licensee shall provide for the development, revision, implementation, and maintenance of its safeguards
contingency plan. To this end, the licensee shall provide for a review nominally every 24 months of the safeguards
contingency plan by individuals independent of both security program management and personnel who have direct responsibility
for implementation of the security program. The review must include a review and audit of safeguards contingency
procedures and practices, an audit of the security system testing and maintenance program, and a test of the safeguards
systems, along with commitments established for response by local law enforcement authorities. The results of the
review and audit, along with recommendations for improvements, must be documented, reported to the licensee's corporate
and plant management, and kept available at the plant for inspection for a period of three years.

(4) The security program must be reviewed nominally every 24 months by individuals independent of both security program
management and personnel who have direct responsibility for implementation of the security program. The security
program review must include an audit of security procedures and practices, an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the physical protection system, an audit of the physical protection system testing and maintenance program, and
an audit of commitments established for response by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local law enforcement authorities. The results and recommendations of the security program review, management's
findings on whether the security program is currently effective, and any actions taken as a result of recommendations
from prior program reviews must be documented in a report to the licensee's plant manager and to corporate management
at least one level higher than that having responsibility for the day-to-day plant operation. These reports must
be maintained in an auditable form, available for inspection, for a period of three years.

The petitioner states that this petition for rulemaking merely allows successful, existing functions to continue
without formal review at a frequency of nominally every two years rather than once per 12 months. The petitioner states
that the annual audit frequency is not necessary to ensure an adequate safeguards contingency plan and security program,
nor is it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commensurate with present industry performance in this area. Further, the petitioner states that it is not required
to support NRC evaluation of program adequacy.

This action would modify the official description of the Class D airspace associated with the Cherry Capital Airport,
Traverse City, Michigan, by adding the phrase: ``This Class D airspace area is effective during the specific dates
and times established in advance by a Notice to Airmen. The effective date and time will thereafter be continuously
published in the Airport Facility Director.'' On September 18, 1993, Airspace Reclassification discontinued the
use of the terms ``control zone'' and ``airport traffic area.'' Airspace designated from the surface for an airport
where there is an operating control tower is now Class D airspace. The intended effect of this action is to allow a variation
of Class D airspace effective times to coincide with the operating hours of the Traverse City, Michigan, Airport Traffic
Control Tower at Cherry Capital Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the official
description of the Class D airspace associated with the Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City, Michigan. The purpose
of this proposed amendment is to allow a variation to the Class D airspace effective times to coincide with the operating
hours of the Traverse City ATCT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in the document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to establish Restricted
Area, R&hyph;6302E, Fort Hood, TX, above the existing Restricted Areas R&hyph;6302A, B, C, and D, to accommodate
the firing of heatseeker missiles at the Fort Hood AAF weapons complex. The maximum altitude of the existing Fort Hood
restricted area is 30,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). The proposed Restricted Area R&hyph;6302E would coincide with
the existing lateral boundaries of Restricted Areas R&hyph;6302A, B, C, and D, and would extend from 30,000 feet MSL
to 45,000 feet MSL. This action is a result of a Special Use Airspace Review conducted at the Fort Hood AAF in May 1993.
The proposed Restricted Area R&hyph;6302E would be a joint-use restricted area, activated by NOTAM 48 hours in advance,
not to exceed 90 days per year, weather makeup days included. The airspace would be returned to the controlling agency
when not required for military activities. The U.S. Army does not expect any increase in the total annual usage of the
area as a result of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations
under the Wool Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wool Act (15 U.S.C. 68) requires marketers of covered wool products to mark each product with (1) the generic names
and percentages by weight of the constituent fibers present in the wool product; (2) the name under which the manufacturer
or other responsible company does business, or in lieu thereof, the registered identification number (RN) of such
company; and (3) the name of the country where the wool product was processed or manufactured. Furthermore, the Wool
Act contains advertising and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Wool Act, ``[t]he Commission
is authorized and directed to make rules and regulations for the manner and form of disclosing information required
by this Act *&blank;*&blank;* and to make such further rules and regulations under and in pursuance of the terms of
this Act as may be necessary and proper for administration and enforcement.'' (15 U.S.C. 68d(a).) These implementing
rules and regulations are set forth at 16 CFR part 300. The Commission solicits public comments on the following questions:

At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations
under the Fur Products Labeling Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fur Act (15 U.S.C. 69) requires covered furs and fur products to be labeled, invoiced, and advertised to show (1)
the name(s) of the animal that produced the fur(s); (2) that the fur is used fur or that the fur product contains used
fur, when such is the fact; (3) that the fur product or fur is bleached, dyed, or otherwise artificially colored, when
such is the fact; and (4) the name of the country of origin of any imported furs used in the fur product. Furthermore,
the Fur Act contains invoicing, advertisting, and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to Section 8(b) of the Fur
Act, ``[t]he Commmision is authorized and directed to prescribe rules and regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may
be necessary and proper for purposes of administration and enforcement of this Act.'' (15 U.S.C. 69f(b).) These implementing
rules and regulations are set forth at 16 CFR part 301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Rules 19 and 27 (16 CFR 301.19 and 301.27) include provisions where measurements are expressed exclusively
in inches or fractions of inches. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801, July 29, 1991), and the Metric
Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), all federal agencies are
required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business-related actvities
(which includes rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant
inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these requirements, should the Commission
elect to retain Rules 19 and 27 after conducting this review, the wording of these provisions will be altered to include
the metric equivalents in parentheses beside the measurements in inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(i)(1) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(1)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing, or treating a fur
pelt in such a manner that it is required under paragraph (e) or (h) of this section to be dsecribed as `color altered'
or `color added' shall place a black stripe at least one half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side of the skin
immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid black center in the form of either a two inch (5.08 cm) square
or a circle at least two inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather side of the pelt and shall use black ink for all other
stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(i)(2) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(2)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing or treating a fur
pelt which after processing is considered natural under paragraph (g) of this section shall place a white stripe at
least one-half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side of the skin immediately above the rump or place a stamp
with a solid white center in the form of either a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) in diameter
on the leather side of the pelt and shall use white ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(i)(3) (16 CFR 301.19(i)(3)) would be revised to read: ``Any person dressing, processing or treating a fur
pelt in such a manner that it is considered dyed under paragraph (d) of this section shall place a yellow stripe at least
one-half inch (1.27 cm) in width across the leather side immediately above the rump or place a stamp with a solid yellow
center in the form of either a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square or a circle at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) in diameter on the leather
side of the pelt and shall use yellow ink for all other stamps or markings on the leather side of the pelt.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 19(1)(2) (16 CFR 301.19(1)(2)) would be revised to read: ``A recommended method for preparation of samples would
be: Carefully pluck hair samples from 10 to 15 different representative sites on the pelt or garment. This can best
be accomplished by using a long nose stainless steel pliers with a tip diameter of 1/16 inch (1.59 mm). The pliers should
be inserted at the same angle as the guard hairs with the tip opened to 1/4 inch (6.35 mm). After contact with the hide,
the tip should be raised about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm), closed tightly and pulled quickly and firmly to remove the hair.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first sentence of Rule 27 (16 CFR 301.27) would be revised to read: ``At all times during the marketing of a fur product
the required label shall have a minimum dimension of one and three-fourths (13/4) inches by two and three-fourths
(23/4) inches (4.5 cm &times; 7 cm).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are technical, non-substantive amendments to Rules 19 and 27 which merely provide metric equivalents to the
measurements expressed in inches; they do not create any new requirements. Thus, under the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), no formal rulemaking proceeding is necessary to implement these revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission elects to retain Rule 43 (16 CFR 301.43), ``Use of deceptive trade or corporate names, trademarks
or graphic representations prohibited,'' after conducting this review, it intends to update certain terms to reflect
statutory and policy changes that have occurred since Rule 43 was originally promulgated. The phrase ``capacity
or tendency to mislead or deceive'' would be changed to conform with the language regarding deception that is set forth
in Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 164&hyph;65 (1984) and subsequent cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission solicits public comments on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is there a continuing need for the Rules and Regulations issued under the Fur Act?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically.
These reviews will seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory
and economic impact. The information obtained will assist the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant
modification or revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At this time, the Commission solicits written public comments concerning the Commission's Rules and Regulations
under the Textile Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Textile Act (15 U.S.C. 70) requires marketers of covered textile products to mark each product with (1) the generic
names and percentages by weight of the constituent fibers present in the textile product; (2) the name under which
the manufacturer or other responsible company does business, or in lieu thereof, the registered identification
number (RN) of such company; and (3) the name of the country where the textile product was processed or manufactured.
Furthermore, the Textile Act contains advertising and recordkeeping provisions. Pursuant to section 7(c) of the
Textile Act, ``[t]he Commission is authorized and directed to make such rules and regulations, including the establishment
of generic names of manufactured fibers, under and in pursuance of the terms of this Act as may be necessary and proper
for administration and enforcement.'' (15 U.S.C. 70e(c).) These implementing rules and regulations are set forth
at 16 CFR part 303.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 (16 CFR 303.10, 303.21, 303.32, and 303.45) include provisions where measurements
are expressed exclusively in inch/pound units. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801, July 29,
1991), and the Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), all
federal agencies are required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business-related
activities (which includes rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant
inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these requirements, should the Commission
elect to retain Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 after conducting this review, the wording of these provisions will be altered
to include the metric equivalents in parentheses beside the measurements in inch/pound units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 10(b) (16 CFR 303.10(b)) would be revised to read: ``Where drapery or upholstery fabrics are manufactured on
hand-operated looms for a particular customer after the sale of such fabric has been consummated, and the amount of
the order does not exceed 100 yards (91.44 m) of fabric, the required fiber content disclosure may be made by listing
the fibers present in order of predominance by weight with any fiber or fibers required to be designated as ``other
fiber'' or ``other fibers'' appearing last, as for example:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 21(a)(1) (16 CFR 303.21(a)(1)) would be revised to read: ``If the samples, swatches, or specimens are less than
two square inches (12.9 cm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in area and the information otherwise required to appear on the label is clearly, conspicuously, and non-deceptively
disclosed on accompanying promotional matter in accordance with the Act and regulations;''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 32 (16 CFR 303.32) would be revised to read: ``Any upholstered product, mattress, or cushion which contains stuffing
which has been previously used as stuffing in any other upholstered product, mattress, or cushion shall have securely
attached thereto a substantial tag or label, at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) by 3 inches (7.62 cm) in size, and statements
thereon conspicuously stamped or printed in the English language and in plain type not less than 1/3 inch (8.38 mm)
high, indicating that the stuffing therein is composed in whole or in part of ``reused stuffing,'' ``secondhand stuffing,''
``previously used stuffing,'' or ``used stuffing.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 45(a)(xv) (16 CFR 303.45(a)(xv)) would be revised to read: ``Flags with heading or more than 216 square inches
(13.9 dm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in size;''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are technical, non-substantive amendments to Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 which merely provide metric equivalents
to the measurements expressed in inch/pound units; they do not create any new requirements. Thus, under the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), no formal rulemaking proceeding is necessary to implement these revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission solicits public comments on the following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') is soliciting comments on the Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation
Rule (the ``Used Car Rule'' or ``Rule''). Specifically, the Commission is requesting comments about the overall
costs and benefits of the Rule and its overall regulatory and economic impact as a part of its systematic review of all
current Commission regulations and guides. Additionally, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the
Commission is soliciting comments and data on whether the Used Car rule has had a significant economic impact on small
entities, and if it has, whether the Rule should be amended to minimize any such economic impact on small entities.
The Commission also is soliciting comments on two nonsubstantive amendments the Commission proposes to make to the
Spanish language version of the Buyers Guide.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission promulgated the Used Car Rule, 16 CFR part 455, under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(``FTC Act''), and the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. 2309, on November 19, 1984. 49 FR 45692 (1984). The Rule
became effective on May 9, 1985. Any violation of the Rule constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice under
the FTC Act, and is subject to civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Used Car Rule is primarily intended to prevent oral misrepresentations and unfair omissions of material facts
by used car dealers concerning warranty coverage. The Rule provides a uniform method for written disclosure of warranty
information on a window sticker called the ``Buyers Guide.'' The Rule requires clear disclosure on the Buyers Guide
of the basic terms and conditions of any warranty offered in connection with the sale of a used car, including the duration
of coverage, the percentage of total repair costs to be paid by the dealer, and the exact systems covered by the warranty.

The Rule also requires other disclosures that must be printed directly on the Buyers Guide, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A suggestion that consumers ask the dealer if a pre-purchase inspection is permitted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A warning against reliance on spoken promises that are not confirmed in writing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A list of fourteen major systems of an automobile and the major problems that may occur in these systems. The Rule
also provides that the Buyers Guide disclosures are to be incorporated by reference into the sales contract, and are
to govern in the event of an inconsistency between the Buyers Guide and the sales contract. When used car dealers conduct
sales in the Spanish language, Spanish language Buyers Guides are required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(the ``RFA''), requires that the FTC conduct a periodic review of rules that have or may have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, as part of its oversight responsibilities, the Commission
has determined to review rules and guides periodically. See 59 FR 2955 (Jan. 20, 1994). Both reviews will seek information
about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory impact. The information obtained
will assist the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant modification or rescission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA review is limited to determining whether the Rule should be continued without change, or should
be amended or rescinded, consistent with the state objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any significant
economic impact of the Rule upon a substantial number of small entities. For the purpose of the RFA review, a ``small
entity'' is a used motor vehicle dealer with less than $11.5 million in annual sales, as defined by the Small Business
Size Standards, 13 CFR 121.601. The purpose of the Commission's periodic review is to solicit comment on issues relating
to the operation of the Rule. This review is not limited to the Rule's impact on small entities, but encompass all affected
entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also solicits comment on two non-substantive amendments the Commission proposes to the Rule involving
the Spanish language version of the Buyers Guide, &sect;455.5 of the Rule. The first proposed change is grammatical:
The ``As Is'' (``Como Esta-Sin Garantia'') section of the Buyers Guide reads ``El vendedor no asume ninguna responsabilidad
por cualquier 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
las reparaciones
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). This language will be amended to read: ``El vendedor no asume ninguna responsabilidad
por cualquier reparacione *&blank;*&blank;*'' The second suggested modification appears in the ``Warranty''
(``Garantia'') section of the Buyers Guide. The word ``vendedo'' in the second full sentence will be amended to read
``Pida al 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260), Kentucky submitted a proposed program
amendment that would add a new section (405 KAR 7:200) to Kentucky's Administrative Regulations. The proposed new
regulation offers surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal combustion waste on the permit area
under the special waste permit-by-rule established at 401 KAR 45:060 Section 1(6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the January 13, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 1921) and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on February 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated April 18, 1994, Kentucky gave OSM notice that it was withdrawing the program amendment, submitted
on November 17, 1993, from further consideration. The regulation, which was the subject of the amendment, completed
the promulgation process and took effect on March 13, 1994. During promulgation, a letter of objection was attached
to the regulation by the Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee, with the result that the regulation expired
April 15, 1994, upon adjournment of the regular session of the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly. During the same legislative
session, Senate bill 266 which addresses the same issues, was enacted into law and has been submitted to OSM as a proposed
amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program and will be the subject of a separate rulemaking by OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed program amendment published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been certified that this proposed rule does not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This determination is made based upon the fact that the rule merely recodifies the procedural aspects
of the Defense Investigative Service Freedom of Information Act Program, which includes guidance on how and from
whom to request information pertaining to the Defense Investigative Service; it imposes no new requirements, rights,
or benefits on small entities; and will have neither a beneficial nor adverse affect on small entities. Prior publication
of this rule may be found at 53 FR 36968, September 23, 1988. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 58180, November 16, 1991.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of DIS to make publicly available all information which may be released under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA), consistent with its other responsibilities. In implementing this policy, DIS follows the procedures
set forth in 32 CFR part 286. DIS maintains the following records which may be of interest to the public:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII), which contains references to investigative records
created and held by DoD Components. The records indexed are primarily those prepared by the investigative agencies
of the DoD, covering criminal, fraud, counterintelligence, and personnel security information. This index also
includes security clearance determinations made by the various components of the Department of Defense. Information
in the DCII is not usually available to the general public, since general release would violate the privacy of individuals
whose names are indexed therein.

(a) All requests will be submitted in writing to: Defense Investigative Service, Office of Information and Public
Affairs (V0020), 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;1651.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests directed to any agency activity (headquarters or field elements) will be forwarded to the Office of Information
and Public Affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All requests shall contain the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As complete an identification as possible of the desired material including to the extent known, the title, description,
and date. 32 CFR part 286 does not authorize ``fishing expeditions.'' In the event a request is not reasonably described
as defined in 32 CFR part 286, the requester will be notified by DIS of the defect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The request must contain the first name, middle name or initial, surname, date and place of birth, social security
number, and, if applicable, military service number of the individual concerned, with respect to material concerning
investigations of an individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement as to whether the requester wishes to inspect the record or obtain a copy of it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A statement that all costs for search (in the case of ``other'' and ``commercial'' requesters), duplication (in
the case of all categories of requesters), and review (in the case of ``commercial requesters'') will be borne by the
requester even if no records, or no releasable records, are found, if appropriate. See 32 CFR part 286 for information
on fees and fee waivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The full address (including ZIP code) of the requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A notarized request by an individual requesting investigative or other personnel records may be required to avoid
the risk of invasion of privacy. Requesters will be notified and furnished appropriate forms if this requirement
is deemed necessary. In lieu of a notarized statement, an unsworn declaration in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746 may
be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When a request is incomplete or fails to include all of the information required, the requester will be contacted
for additional information prior to beginning release procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) DIS shall normally respond to requests within 10 working days after receipt by the Office of Information and Public
Affairs, unless an extension is required and the requester is notified in writing. If a significant number of requests
prevents responding in 10 working days, requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure
equitable treatment to all requesters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When the release of information has been approved, a statement of costs computed in accordance with the DoD Fee
Schedule (32 CFR part 286), or a statement waiving the fee, will be included in the notification of approval. Records
approved for release will generally be mailed immediately following the receipt of fees. Fees may be waived or reduced
in accordance with 32 CFR part 286. Remittances must be in the form of a personal check, bank draft, or postal money order.
Remittances are to be made payable to the Treasurer of the United States. Certified documents may be requested for
an official government or legal function, and will be provided at a rate established by 32 CFR part 286 for each authentication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When requests are denied in whole or in part in accordance with 32 CFR part 286, the requester will be advised of the
identity of the official making the denial, the reason for the denial, the right of appeal of the decision, and the identity
of the person to whom an appeal may be addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Facilities for the review or reproduction of records following approval of the request or appeal are available
at the Defense Investigative Service, Office of Information and Public Affairs, 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria,
Virginia 22314&hyph;1651. All other transactions will be conducted by mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes amending the regulations concerning vessel Hull Identification Numbers (HIN) and establishing
new regulations requiring Certificates of Origin for new vessels offered for sale in the United States. The Coast
Guard is proposing the regulations in order to provide additional information identifying vessels and establishing
evidence of vessel ownership to aid in marine investigations, deter theft, and provide a more useful vessel identifier
for the purposes of developing the vessel identification system, as required by legislation. The Coast Guard also
proposes to make several editorial corrections to its HIN regulations.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Transportation is required to establish the Vessel Identification System (VIS) (46 U.S.C. chapters
125, 131 &amp; 313) for use by the public and law enforcement officials. The Secretary has delegated to the Commandant,
U.S. Coast Guard, the authority to implement VIS. VIS will provide a nationwide pool of vessel and vessel owner information
that will help in identification and recovery of stolen vessels and deter vessel theft. This rulemaking would aid
in the development of VIS by expanding the existing 12 character HIN to include certain vessel-specific information
and thereby create a more useful vessel identification number. Further, requiring vessel manufacturers and importers
to provide a Certificate of Origin with each vessel produced or imported for the purposes of sale would ensure the availability
of documentation certifying this information and establishing a chain of ownership.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Investigations of lost and stolen vessels depend in large part on the proper authorities' ability to identify a vessel
and establish a chain of ownership. The proposed regulations would aid in this pursuit by expanding the current 12
character HIN to include detailed information about each vessel. In addition, a check digit in the expanded HIN would
make alteration of an HIN more difficult thereby helping to prevent fraud in the sale of vessels. The proposed regulations
would also require that vessel manufacturers provide a Certificate of Origin certifying the truth about certain
information in the HIN and for use as the first document in the paper trail establishing proof of vessel ownership.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of the definition for ``model year'' would clear up a drafting error which has existed since the last time the
HIN regulations were amended in 1984. Finally, removal of the references to ``State Boating Law Administrator''
in 33 CFR 181.31(c) would allow States which use their Department of Motor Vehicles as vessel numbering and titling
authorities to issue HINs to individuals building their own vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discusses the proposed changes to 33 CFR part 181:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) ``Model Year'' Definition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``model year'' would be removed from &sect;181.3. Up until 1984 the regulations allowed for two
methods of indicating the date of manufacture in the last four characters of the 12 character HIN. When those two formats
were devised, it was the Coast Guard's understanding that the new model year would not commence prior to August. Some
manufacturers complained that they wanted to vary the introduction date of the new model year from year to year, but
that they were prevented from doing so by the HIN regulations which defines model year as the period beginning August
1 of any year and ending on July 31 of the following year. The Coast Guard amended the HIN regulations in 1984 to give vessel
manufacturers the freedom to designate model year in the HIN as they requested. The Coast Guard amended &sect;181.25(a)
to require characters 11 and 12 to indicate the model year using the last two characters of the model year such as ``84''
for 1984. However, due to a drafting error, the Coast Guard failed to delete the outdated and superfluous definition
of ``model year.'' The proposed amendments would remove the definition of ``model year'' from part 181.

(b) Incorporation by Reference

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following material would be incorporated by reference in &sect;181.4:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 3166 ``Codes for the representation of names of
countries.'' International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 1073/I&hyph;1976 ``Alphanumeric
character sets for optical recognition_Part I: Character Set OCR&hyph;A_Shapes and dimensions of the printed image.''
Copies of the material are available for inspection where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Copies of the material are available at the addresses in &sect;181.4. Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard
will submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register for approval of the incorporations by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISO Standard 3166 contains two character alphabetic codes which would be used to indicate the ``country code'' in
the expanded HIN. ISO Standard 1073/I&hyph;1976 prescribes shapes and sizes of alphanumeric characters for optical
character recognition (OCR) systems, which means that the characters are both human and machine readable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Nineteen Character Hull Identification Number
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing Hull Identification Number (HIN) is a unique 12 character serial number required on each recreational
vessel manufactured in or imported into the United States for the purposes of sale. The Coast Guard assigns the first
three characters, a Manufacturer Identification Code (MIC) which identifies the manufacturer or importer; characters
four through eight are a manufacturer serial number; characters nine and ten indicate date of certification for vessels
subject to safety standards or the date of manufacture for vessels not subject to standards; and characters eleven

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two serious problems involving the current 12 character HIN format. Thieves can alter an HIN and ``launder''
a stolen vessel in States with ineffective titling and registration programs. Similarly, the last four characters
in many HINs are fraudulently altered as a means of misrepresenting vessels as ``newer.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As early as May 1987, the National Auto Theft Bureau (NATB), which is supported by more than 600 casualty insurance
companies, recommended that the Coast Guard adopt a 17 character HIN format (similar to the format required for the
Vehicle Identification Number [VIN] on an automobile) as a means of detecting and deterring vessel theft. Each VIN
contains certain characters which describe features such as body style and engine type which are specific to the automobile
to which the VIN is assigned. A VIN also contains a check digit which assures the integrity of the other characters in
a VIN. According to the NATB and officials of the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA),
the additional HIN characters would lead to increased recovery of stolen vessels and more successful enforcement
efforts, thereby deterring would-be thieves.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During meetings with the International Standards Organization (ISO) some ISO member countries expressed a desire
for the Coast Guard to include a two character country of MIC registration code as part of the expanded HIN format to
distinguish between MICs issued by different foreign countries. The Coast Guard agrees that including the two character
country of MIC registration code in the proposed HIN would be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed expanded HIN would consists of 19 characters. The additional seven characters would indicate country
of MIC registration, length, hull material, principal means of propulsion, vessel type and a check digit. The expanded
HIN with its check digit would reflect additional information useful to law enforcement authorities investigating
vessel thefts and provide a useful means of identifying vessels in VIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 181.25 would be revised to require that each of the Hull Identification Numbers prescribed by &sect;181.23
must consist of 19 characters uninterrupted by slashes, hyphens or spaces:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characters one and two would be the two character alphabetic ``country code'' from ISO Standard 3166. The country
code for Manufacturer ID Codes the Coast Guard assigns in the United States, for example, would be ``US.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Characters three through five would be the existing manufacturer identification code the Coast Guard assigns
to the vessel manufacturer in accordance with &sect;181.31(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Characters six through ten would be the serial number the manufacturer currently assigns in accordance with &sect;181.25(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Characters eleven and twelve would indicate date of certification for vessels subject to safety standards or
the date of manufacture for vessels not subject to standards in accordance with the existing format specified in &sect;181.25(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Characters thirteen and fourteen would indicate the model year in accordance with the existing format specified
in &sect;181.25(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The fifteenth character would indicate overall length of the vessel using a corresponding letter of the English
alphabet. The character, ``A,'' would indicate a vessel with a hull length of less than six feet; ``B'' would indicate
a vessel with a hull length of six feet to 10 feet, 11 inches; ``C'' would indicate 11 feet; ``D'' would indicate 12 feed,
and so on. The character, ``Z'', would indicate a vessel with a hull length of more than 31 feet. Inches would not be included
in the measurement of length, therefore, 15 feet, 10 inches is 15 feet and 16 feet, 2 inches is 16 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The sixteen character would indicate hull material using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one
through eight would indicate aluminum, ferrocement, fiber reinforced plastic (FRP), flexible fabric, foam, plastic,
steel and wood, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The seventeenth character would indicate the principal means of propulsion of the vessel using a corresponding
Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals one through nine would indicate air propeller, bracket mounted outboard, inboard,
inboard jet, inboard/outdrive, nonpowered, outboard, sail and sail with inboard auxiliary, respectively. Footnotes
to a table in this section would distinguish between which Arabic numerals to use to indicate nonpowered vessels,
sailboats and sailboats with auxiliary power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The eighteenth character would indicate the type of vessel using a corresponding Arabic numeral. Arabic numerals
one through nine would indicate air cushion vehicle; canoe, kayak, sailboard or surfboard; inflatable; monohull/cabin
configuration; monohull/closed bow; monohull/open bow; multihull/cabin or closed bow; multihull/open deck;
and personal watercraft, respectively. Footnotes to a table in this section would distinguish between which Arabic
numerals to use to indicate the vessel types described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The nineteenth character would be a check digit determined by performing certain arithmetic calculations involving
the previous 18 characters. Characters consisting of letters of the English alphabet would be converted to corresponding
numerical values. A diagram in the section would show how the calculations should be performed. The Coast Guard has
developed a computer program which calculates the check digit and is available to any vessel manufacturer with a computer.
The Coast Guard has also developed several work sheets to help determine the HIN for a vessel which are also available.

Section 181.31 prescribes the regulations on the assignment of a Manufacturer Identification Code (MIC) to each
recreational vessel manufacturer and importer. According to &sect;181.31(c), persons who are building vessels
for their own use and not for the purposes of sale, must obtain an entire Hull Identification Number from the State Boating
Law Administrator of the State where the vessel will be principally used, in lieu of applying for a MIC. A number of the
States use their Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for numbering and titling of vessels and the DMV would issue a State
HIN. Under the proposed amendments, references to ``State Boating Law Administrator'' would be removed from the
section and the words ``the issuing authority of the State'' would be added in their place.

(e) Certificate of Origin
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is required to include information assisting law enforcement officials in VIS (46 U.S.C. 12501(b)(6)).
A Certificate of Origin (COO) is a document issued by a product's manufacturer certifying to the truth of certain facts.
Many States require vessel owners to provide a COO before they will issue a title or register and number a vessel. Thus,
a COO is usually the first document in the paper trail identifying a vessel and establishing proof of ownership. Unfortunately,
many vessel manufacturers do not issue COOs for vessels they manufacture or they issue COOs which many States consider
unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A purchaser's possession of a standardized COO for a vessel would ensure that documentation of the vessel's chain
of ownership is established. This would aid law enforcement investigations by providing a means to demonstrate vessel
ownership as well as providing a means to certify vessel information that could be used in the development of VIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed amendments the Coast Guard would add a new Subpart D_``Certificates of Origin for Boats.'' The
proposed amendments would require manufactures and U.S. importers of foreign-built vessels to provide a completed
COO with each vessel manufactured or imported. The issuing authorities in the States would be given the option of issuing
COOs to individuals building their own vessels or exempting them from the requirement altogether.

Comments or suggestions pertaining to the format or content will be welcomed. Also, the Coast Guard specifically
seeks comments on the most cost efficient manner to create and distribute the forms. Any proposed form will be submitted

Solicitation of Views
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is particularly interested in receiving comments on the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The majority of the recreational vessel manufacturers are small volume builders who lack computers and cannot
use a computer program developed by the Coast Guard. These manufacturers may have a difficult time determining the
check digit in the proposed 19 character Hull Identification Number. When using simple arithmetic, those calculations
may take as long as 15 minutes per vessel. Is 15 minutes a reasonable estimate for performing the calculation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should the Coast Guard consider expecting certain classes of low cost vessels from the 19 character HIN, or do States
which number all watercraft insist on universal application of this requirement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Are there other methods for calculation of the check digit which are not as time consuming and will still assure
the integrity of the other characters in an HIN?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The proposed regulations will require a COO for each new vessel manufactured or imported. Since a COO is unique
to the vessel to which it is assigned, there may be some additional requirements associated with ensuring that the
proper COO accompanies each vessel, particularly for importers of inflatables and similar, high volume, low cost
vessels which are shipped in bulk containers. As a result, the COO requirement in the proposed regulations may require
change in the manner in which small, high volume vessels are packaged for shipment. Should the Coast Guard consider
excepting from the COO requirement certain classes of low cost vessels, or vessels involving special problems associated
with the manner in which they are shipped?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Do the States which number all watercraft insist on universal application of the COO requirement?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) A prototype of a proposed COO form is reproduced in appendix A. The Coast Guard proposes issuing a COO template to
all boat manufactures and importers which they could copy to make COO forms for each boat. The Coast Guard would partially
complete the COO templates with each manufacturer (or importer) name and address and the first five characters of
the HIN as a means for minimizing information collection burdens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Coast Guard is seeking comments on whether the proposed COO contains sufficient security features and
information to make it an effective document. The NASBLA Numbering and Titling Committee has recommended, through
a mailing to the Coast Guard, that the COO form be machine readable utilizing the OCR&hyph;A font which provides the
criteria for character set and print quality for optical character recognition; be uniform in all jurisdictions;
and conform to the following format, standards, security, and specifications:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an engraved border produced from banknote engraved artwork;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Feature a prismatic, i.e., rainbow printing which is used as a deterrent to color copying, and/or a copy void pantograph,
i.e., the word ``void'' appears when the document is copied;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be printed using erasable fluorescent background inks which fluoresce under ultraviolet light and react to any
attempt to erase information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Include a background security design consisting of a repetitious pattern which hinders counterfeiting efforts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Be printed on sensitized security paper that is reactive to chemicals commonly used to alter documents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Be printed on non optical brightener paper without added optical brighteners which will not fluoresce under ultraviolet
light;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Include a microline_a line of small alpha characters in capital letters which requires a magnifying glass to read;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Bear a pre-printed consecutive number for control purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Consist of complex colors which are developed by using a mixture of two or more of the primary colors (red, yellow
and blue) and black if required; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Contain a security thread with or without a watermark, and/or an intaglio print with or without a latent image,
and/or a security laminate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard's preliminary investigations indicate that due to the high cost of creating forms meeting the NASBLA
suggested requirements, the Coast Guard could not absorb the cost of printing COO forms meeting the NASBLA security
features. The Coast Guard does not have the authority to charge manufacturers to reimburse the Coast Guard for its
expenditures on COO forms. Therefore, if the Coast Guard were to adopt the NASBLA recommended security features,
manufacturers would be responsible for creating or purchasing the forms on their own.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there interested parties who believe the NASBLA recommended security features would be appropriate for a State
issued certificate of title, but are excessive for a manufacturer issued certificate of origin?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some manufacturers build thousands of vessels annually, while others may build as few as a single vessel annually.
What do printers estimate would be the costs to various volume boat manufacturers for creating and printing forms
meeting the NASBLA recommended security features?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Coast Guard were able to obtain authorized funding, what would be the cost to the Coast Guard for creating, printing,
partially completing, and distributing forms meeting the NASBLA recommended security features to various volume
boat manufacturers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the contents and security features of a finalized COO form are developed, based upon comments received, what
are the most equitable and cost-efficient methods for creating, printing, and distributing COO forms to boat manufacturers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The proposed &sect;181.47 addresses the subject of duplicate COO forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Who should be able to apply for a duplicate COO form from a boat manufacturer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What information should a duplicate COO contain?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should an affidavit or other type of proof be required as a condition to obtaining a duplicate COO form?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If a duplicate COO must contain the same information as an original, should the regulations require the manufacturer
to retain a copy of each original COO form? For how long?

Regulatory Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and has not been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget. It is also not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal
to be so minimal that a Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project would benefit law enforcement officers by aiding in deterrence and detection of vessel fraud and theft.
An estimated 2,000,000 recreational vessels are manufactured or imported annual. Issuing authorities in the States
issue an estimated 17,000 HINs to individuals building their own vessels annually. This means an estimated 2,017,000
HINs are affixed annually. The estimated average cost for the affixing the existing 12 character HIN is $.50 per vessel.
The estimated cost of expansion to a 19 character format is an additional $.25 per vessel, for a total cost of approximately
$.75 per vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard is soliciting specific comments on the estimated costs for COOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard considered three alternatives in developing the proposed rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Take no action. If the Coast Guard fails to take any action, the numbers of vessels stolen and the incidence of vessel
fraud involving altered HINs will continue to increase. In addition, the development of VIS requires a means for identification
of each vessel and proof of vessel ownership. Use of the 19 character HIN and a COO requirement appear to be the best way
to accomplish those requirements. Many of the States and many law enforcement agencies support the proposal for a
19 character HIN and NASBLA, the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (NBSAC) and the National Association of
Marine Investigators (NAMI), all support Coast Guard adoption of the 19 character HIN. The Coast Guard has also received
numerous complaints from owners who are unable to register their vessels because they do not have a COO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Initiate a rulemaking to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Amend the HIN regulations in 33 CFR part 181 to require additional information about the vessel to be reflected
in the HIN and add a requirement for a check digit to aid in the prevention of fraud, thereby expanding the current HIN
format from 12 to 19 characters; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Require manufacturers and importers to complete a Builder's Certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expanding the HIN to 19 characters would provide the best means of developing a vessel identifier for VIS and help to
discourage and detect alterations of HINs through inclusion of the check digit. While requiring all vessel manufacturers
to provide a completed Builder's Certification would have the advantage of utilizing one form for all vessels whether
documented, numbered or titled, it would prove overly burdensome to many manufacturers and importers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Builder's Certification is designed for use by those documenting a vessel under 46 CFR part 67. Obtaining endorsements
for documented vessels requires detailed information about the vessel, including the country in which the vessel
and its major components were manufactured. Since a COO does not satisfy these documentation information requirements,
it is not accepted as evidence of ownership for the purposes of documentation. The Builder's Certification satisfies
documentation requirements, but would require information well beyond what is needed for VIS purposes and it would
be overly burdensome to require manufacturers and importers to complete a Builder's Certification for every recreational
vessel. The estimated reporting burden for the Builder's Certification is 30 minutes, while the estimated burden
to complete the COO is five minutes. Therefore, requiring a Builder's Certification is not the preferred alternative
for establishing the chain of ownership for the purposes of VIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Initiate a rulemaking to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Amend the HIN regulations in 33 CFR part 181 to require additional information about the vessel to be reflected
in the HIN and add a requirement for a check digit to aid in the prevention of fraud, thereby expanding the current HIN
format from 12 to 19 characters; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Require manufacturers and importers to provide a completed COO for each recreational vessel they manufacture
or import. This is the preferred alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This alternative would provide VIS with the preferred 19 character HIN as well as the best method of establishing the
chain of ownership for VIS purposes through the COO requirement. The COO requirement would provide all the information
necessary for VIS and would take just five minutes to complete.

Small Entities

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small business that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations will apply to the following small entities: Small manufacturers building vessels, small
importers importing vessels and State issuing authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are reporting requirements associated with an expanded HIN that could be more burdensome to small entities
than to the larger volume manufacturers, especially in the calculation of the check digit. Eighty percent of the new
recreational vessels manufactured annually are build by 20 percent of the industry. These are large companies with
engineering departments that are equipped with computers and the expertise to understand and properly encode the
additional characters and the check digit. The majority of the recreational vessel manufacturers, however, are
small volume builders who may have a more difficult time implementing the regulations and making the necessary calculations
to determine the check digit. When using simple arithmetic, those calculations may take as long as 15 minutes per vessel.
The Coast Guard has developed a computer program which calculates the check digit which is available to any vessel
manufacturer with a computer. The Coast Guard has also developed several work sheets to help determine the HIN for
a vessel and the worksheets are also available. Therefore, preliminary analysis indicates that a 19 character HIN
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement for a COO may also result in additional requirements for small entities. Since a COO is unique to the
vessel to which it is assigned, there may be some additional requirements associated with assuring that the proper
COO accompanies each vessel, particularly for importers of inflatables and similar, high volume, low cost vessels
which are shipped in bulk containers. As a result, the COO requirement in the proposed regulations may require changes
in the manner in which small, high volume vessels are packaged for shipment. However, a preliminary analysis indicates
that the COO requirement will not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 4,000 U.S. manufacturers and importers of recreational vessels. They manufacture or import
an estimated 2,000,000 recreational vessels annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighty percent are built by major manufacturers. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates five minutes
per vessel to determine the HIN and affix it to the vessel:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty percent of the vessels are built by small and often non-sophisticated manufacturers. For those manufacturers
the Coast Guard estimates 15 minutes per vessel to determine the HIN and affix it to the vessel:

An estimated 17,000 individuals build their own vessels annually. Individuals building their own vessels are assigned
an entire Hull Identification Number by the State in which they reside. The Coast Guard estimates that it takes an individual
approximately 15 minutes to affix the HIN to a vessel:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This total annual burden estimate would vary from year to year depending upon the state of the national economy which
impacts upon annual production figures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also no practical way to estimate the burden per respondent for the proposed COO requirement. The respondents
are vessel manufacturers and importers and State vessel registration and numbering authorities and members of the
public who build their own vessels. Most manufacturers with a computer will not suffer from significant burdens,
because the computer can be programmed to generate completed COOs. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates
3 minutes per vessel to complete a COO:

Twenty percent of the vessels are built by small and often non-sophisticated manufacturers. For those manufacturers
the Coast Guard estimates 5 minutes per vessel to type the required information (security standards would require
that the COO be machine prepared):

Approximately 17,000 individuals build their own vessels annually. The States assign Hull Identification Numbers
to individuals building their own vessels. For individuals the Coast Guard estimates 30 minutes per vessel to obtain
a COO from the State.

States and territories participating in VIS and assigning Hull Identification Numbers would have computers to generate
the COO and HIN on the basis of information supplied by an individual. The Coast Guard estimates 5 minutes for States
or territories to enter information about a vessel into a computer and generate a COO:

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. These regulations will benefit State boating authorities enforcing State
titling and registration regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title 46 U.S.C. 4302 authorizes the Coast Guard to establish HIN regulations. Unless the Secretary provides an exemption,
a State may not establish, continue in effect, or enforce a law or regulation that is not identical to a regulation prescribed
under 46 U.S.C. 4302. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State and local laws and regulations which are
not identical to the Coast Guard's HIN or COO requirements. Title 46 U.S.C. chapter 125 requires the Coast Guard to
establish VIS requirements. The States' participation in VIS is entirely voluntary; however, once a State elects
to participate, it must comply with the requirements of VIS in order to ensure the integrity and uniformity of the system.
Therefore, only those States meeting all of the VIS requirements will be allowed to participate in the VIS system,
and the Coast Guard would preempt State and local laws prescribing requirements for VIS which are not identical to
those the Coast Guard prescribes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The first two characters must be an alphabetic code from column 2 of ISO 3166&hyph;88 indicating the country of
manufacturer identification code registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Characters three through five must be a manufacturer identification code assigned under &sect;181.31(a) or
the importer designation assigned under &sect;181.31(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Characters six through ten must be a serial number assigned by the manufacturer in letters of the English alphabet,
or Arabic numerals, or both, and may not include the letters, I, O and Q.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Characters eleven and twelve must indicate the month and year of certification when a date of certification is
required. In all other cases characters eleven and twelve must indicate the date of manufacture. The date indicated
can be no earlier than the date construction or assembly began and no later than the date the vessel leaves the place
of manufacture or assembly or is imported into the United States for the purposes of sale. Character eleven must be
indicated using letters of the English alphabet. The first month of the year, January, must be designated by the letter
``A'', the second month, February, by the letter ``B'', and so on until the last month of the year, December. Character
twelve must be the last digit of the year of manufacture or certification and must be an Arabic numeral.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Characters thirteen and fourteen must indicate the model year using Arabic numerals for the last two numbers of
the model year such as ``94'' for 1994 and ``95'' for 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The fifteenth character must indicate the overall length of the vessel using the corresponding letter of the English
alphabet from Table 181.25(f).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) anticipates a significant increase in the number of
alternatively fueled motor vehicles in the United States. This expectation stems from initiatives by the President,
Congress, State and local governments, and private interest, since these vehicles will help reduce air pollution
and conserve petroleum fuel. NHTSA has undertaken a comprehensive program to address the safe performance of these
vehicles on the road and in crashes. Further, because the Clean Air Act specifies that vehicle fleets in non-attainment
areas (mostly large cities) must be converted to clean burning fuels, many city transit bus fleets are being converted
to run on fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG). As NHTSA has become more aware of these fleets of heavy vehicles
powered by CNG, the agency believes that their safe performance merits examination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed requirements for CNG fuel
system and fuel container integrity (58 FR 5323). The vehicle fuel system requirements were proposed to apply to vehicles
with a GVWR of 4536 kilograms or less, and all school buses. The container requirements were proposed to apply to CNG
fuel containers for any vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 25, 1994, the agency published a final rule (59 FR 19648), which addresses the fuel system integrity of CNG
vehicles. The new regulation, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 303, applies to all passenger cars,
trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 4536 kilograms of less, and all school buses regardless
of weight. FMVSS No. 303 sets allowable leakage limits for the vehicle fuel system after a barrier crash test. With
regard to the fuel container requirements, NHTSA anticipates issuing another final rule that will specify performance
requirements addressing the strength, durability, and pressure relief of CNG fuel containers. In addition, as a
result of public comments on the January 1993 NPRM, the agency anticipates issuing a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking for CNG fuel containers addressing internal corrosion, brittle fracture under low temperatures, environmental
degradation, external damage, and fragmentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The January 1993 NPRM briefly discussed the issue of whether vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms, other than
school buses, should be included in the vehicle requirements. The agency believes that an opportunity should be provided
for a more focused view on this issue. This request for comment will serve that purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 58 comments were received on the NPRM, of which six addressed CNG safety for vehicles over 4536 kilograms
GVWR other than school buses. Four of the six commenters, Navistar, Chrysler, Flexible, and Amoco, believed that
federal safety requirements should not apply to CNG-powered heavy vehicles. The main reason given by the commenters
was that the vehicle applicability of the CNG fuel system integrity standard should be the same as that for NHTSA's
liquid fuel system integrity standard, FMVSS No. 301, ``Fuel System Integrity.'' The latter only applies to vehicles
with a GVWR of 4536 kilograms or less, and school buses. However, two commenters believed that the requirements should
apply to heavier vehicles. The Transportation Manufacturing Company, a bus manufacturer, believed that heavy vehicles
should have requirements that are comparable to those for smaller vehicles. No rationale was provided. The Washington
Superintendent for Public Instruction (WSPI), also believed that these vehicles should be regulated. WSPI stated
that the agency should consider including these vehicles in the proposed rule, but did not offer a rationale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the lack of accident data indicating a fuel system integrity problem for CNG-powered heavy vehicles, and
the lack of rationale from the two supporters, the agency concluded that FMVSS No. 303 should not apply to heavy vehicles.
However, because of the increasing number of CNG-powered transit buses, the agency seeks information by which to
consider whether federal safety action is desirable, for both transit buses and or other heavy vehicles. It may be
that action is merited with regard to buses, which carry many occupants and can have high traffic exposure, but not
other heavy vehicles with only one or two occupants.

Current and Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of NHTSA's inquiry in this notice, the agency seeks comments on the desirability of actions which would be harmonized
with those of Canada.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FMVSS No. 303 requires that school buses, regardless of weight, must comply with a moving contoured barrier crash
test. In this test, a barrier traveling longitudinally at 48 kilometers per hour impacts the bus at any point and angle.
During and after the impact, the fuel pressure drop must not exceed a specified limit. The final rule contains no requirements
for heavy vehicles other than school buses with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Canada's Existing and Proposed Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Canadian motor vehicle safety standard No. 301.2, ``CNG Fuel System Integrity,'' requires that all vehicles
with a GVWR of more than 4536 kilograms be subjected to a 48 kilometers per hour contoured barrier crash test. This is
similar to the test NHTSA requires for school buses in FMVSS No. 303. On December 11, 1993, Canada proposed an amendment
to its standard. Under the amendment, the current requirement would apply to vehicles with containers mounted lower
than 183 centimeters from the ground. If the fuel containers are mounted 183 centimeters or more above the ground,
the vehicle would need to meet the requirements of the National Standard of Canada CAN/CGA&hyph;B149.4&hyph;M91
Natural Gas for Vehicles Installation Code, dated January 1991 (copy available in the docket). This is a design standard
which specifies in great detail the method for building a CNG vehicle.

Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA seeks two types of information in this notice. First, the agency seeks information regarding the current and
projected population size and vehicle type (transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other heavy vehicle) for
CNG vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms. Second, NHTSA seeks information about the potential safety problems
of these vehicles. When appropriate, please comment by vehicle type, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck,
or other type of heavy vehicle.

CNG Heavy Vehicle Population: Current and Projected
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The agency requests information on how many CNG transit buses, intercity buses, heavy trucks, and other heavy vehicles
of over 4536 kilograms GVWR are in service or are planned to be placed in service in the United States. How many of these
vehicles are made by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and how many are aftermarket vehicles that are converted
from a vehicle powered by gasoline, diesel, or other fuel?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How many entities manufacture heavy CNG vehicles by type, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other
type of heavy vehicle? How many convert them from other fuels, by type, if appropriate? What specifications are used
for converting these vehicles? Do voluntary industry guidelines exist? Please describe and provide the guidelines
or citations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How long have heavy CNG vehicles (by type) been used in this country? What are the projections for their future use,
in terms of numbers and in type of usage?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What are the various locations for mounting CNG containers on heavy vehicles? Which are more common; less common?
Why? At what height are the CNG containers mounted? Are they typically protected by shielding or cages? What factors
go into deciding where to mount the container on the vehicle? How many CNG containers are typically placed on a heavy
vehicle, and how much do the containers weigh? Does the number of containers vary, depending upon the type of vehicle,
i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other type of heavy vehicle?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance in Crashes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is interested in obtaining specific information about crashes involving these heavy vehicles. General
information about the number of accidents as well as information regarding specific issues such as container detachment
would be helpful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Have there been any CNG fuel container or fuel system failures in these types of vehicles? If so, describe the failure,
e.g., sequence of events, what failed, and how it failed. If the failure occurred as the result of a crash, was another
vehicle involved? Please describe the other vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Was the vehicle a transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or some other type of heavy vehicle? Was it an OEM vehicle
or a conversion? Who was the manufacturer of the vehicle? If it was a conversion, who did the conversion? Was the conversion
done before or after the vehicle's first consumer purchase?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Please identify and describe any situations where a container became detached in a crash situation? Did the container
leak? If crashes occurred, were they reported to a policy agency, hazardous materials agency, or other State/local
agency?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should the agency specify how the fuel containers should be attached to the vehicles? Should a requirements apply
to all vehicles or just for those with containers mounted greater than 183 centimeters above the ground (such as referenced
in the Canadian proposal)? Are CNG tanks rigidly mounted or are they mounted so as to be isolated from shock in a crash,
permitting some allowable design movement? What is the typical orientation of the CNG tank with respect to the longitudinal
axis of the vehicle? Does a CNG tank's mounting orientation and method affect its useful life?

9. Were there any injuries to the vehicle occupants, pedestrians, emergency personnel, or other individuals? What
was the type and seriousness of the injury?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. What type (steel, aluminum, fiberglass wrap, carbon fiber wrap, hoop wrap, full wrap, all composite, or other)
was the fuel container? What were the dimensions of the container? What was the service pressure of the container?
Who manufactured the container? How long had it been in service? To which design specification or standard were the
tanks built?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Should any Federal standard include a labeling requirement to address the periodic reinspection of fuel systems
on alternatively fueled vehicles? Should States establish guidelines to address the periodic reinspection or recertification
of such fuel systems? Should these schedules be set at specified time or mileage intervals? After a vehicle is involved
in an accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Should CNG heavy vehicles, which are not school buses, be crash tested for fuel system integrity in the same way
as heavy school buses under FMVSS No. 303, i.e., a contoured barrier traveling at 48 kilometers per hour striking the
test vehicle at any point and angle? If so, which types of CNG heavy vehicle should be included, i.e., transit bus, intercity
bus, heavy truck, or other type? Are there other tests or guidelines which would be more appropriate to assure the fuel
system integrity of such vehicles? If so, what are they?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Venting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the size of these vehicles, there may be large enclosed areas in which natural gas could accumulate if there
is a slow leak in the CNG fuel system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Are there instances where gas accumulated? Did any of them result in explosions?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Should venting of the container away from possible areas of accumulation and potential ignition sources be required
to address leakage accumulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. What experimental or observed data are available regarding the dispersion behavior that results from a CNG fuel
system leak? Will the gas rise or remain near the ground? If the gas remains near the ground, how long will it remain there?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Leakage Detection and Warning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If there is a leak in the fuel system, there would be little or no visible evidence of the gas accumulation. If persons
nearby could not smell the gas, it could accumulate in an area near them without notice, which would increase the potential
for an explosion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Are there instances where CNG leaked out of a vehicle fuel system and caused a safety problem before the natural
gas was detected? Describe how the situation occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Should a leakage detection/warning system be required in vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms to detect
leakage of CNG as well as to warn persons nearby of the potential hazard? What type of system? Is it commercially available?
What would be the cost? Would the leakage detection/warning system, including its power source, become a potential
ignition sources when activated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Refueling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA seeks information on potential safety hazards associated with the refueling of heavy CNG vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Are manufacturers or fleet operators aware of safety hazards or accidents that have occurred during refueling
operations? If so, please provide information on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. What items are included in current guidelines or procedures for CNG refueling, such as the need for grounding straps,
operator protective clothing, etc.?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Is a small amount of CNG normally released during connecting/disconnecting of the refueling equipment? If so,
how much? Are devices, such as excess flow valves, used in refueling equipment to prevent excess CNG leakage in the
event of a refueling line rupture? To what extent are such devices used?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. What standards or guidelines currently exist for refueling couplers and related equipment?

 NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) for the Gulf of
Alaska (GOA) groundfish fishery, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) groundfish fishery, Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off
Alaska. The Research Plan would provide an industry-funded observer program and promote management, conservation,
and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut, and crab resources off Alaska.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and GOA in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area and the FMP for Groundfish
of the GOA. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act) and are implemented for the U.S. fishery by regulations at 50 CFR parts 620, 672, and 675. The domestic
fishery for Pacific halibut off Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided
by the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (16 U.S.C. 773&hyph;773k), with implementing regulations at 50 CFR part
301. Regulations implementing individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the domestic groundfish and halibut fisheries
off Alaska are at 50 CFR part 676. The king and Tanner crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area are managed
under the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. This FMP delegates
management of the crab resources in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area to the State of Alaska (State) with Federal
oversight. Regulations necessary to carry out the crab FMP appear at 50 CFR part 671.

Section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Pub.
L. 102&hyph;582, authorizes the Council to prepare, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary),
a Research Plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction except salmon fisheries. The proposed Research
Plan would require that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating
in the BSAI groundfish, GOA groundfish, and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and
it would allow these requirements to be extended to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers would be deployed for
the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of fisheries
under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also would establish a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing
the Research Plan. The fees would be based on the exvessel value of retained catch in the BSAI and GOA groundfish fisheries,
the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and the Pacific halibut fishery off Alaska
(Research Plan fisheries). Future recommendations by the Council to include other fisheries under the Research
Plan would require an amendment or amendments to the Research Plan and to the regulations implementing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations implementing Amendments 18 and 13 to the FMPs for Groundfish of the GOA and the Groundfish Fishery of the
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, respectively (54 FR 50386, December 6, 1989), authorized a data collection
program to obtain information necessary for conservation and management of the groundfish fisheries. One of the
measures in Amendments 18 and 13 authorized a comprehensive domestic fishery observer program. The Secretary, in
consultation with the Council, prepared and implemented an Observer Plan to implement provisions of that program
(55 FR 4839, February 12, 1990). The Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) implemented a Shellfish Onboard Observer Program
for the king and Tanner crab fisheries off Alaska in April 1988 (5 AAC 39.645). Currently, no observer program is established
for the Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two problems with the current Federal and State observer programs have been identified. First, the costs of observer
coverage are not borne by all fishery participants. Under the current Federal observer program, some groundfish
operations are required to pay for 100 percent observer coverage, others are required to pay for 30 percent coverage,
and still other operations that benefit from the observer program pay none of the cost. The last group includes some
groundfish and all halibut operations, because they have no observer coverage requirements. State king and Tanner
crab regulations require observer coverage for all vessels that process king or Tanner crab in waters off Alaska,
but mandate no observer coverage for crab catcher vessels or shoreside processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the current method of paying for observers under the Federal and State observer programs limits NMFS and State
control over the observer programs and impedes the agencies' ability to manage the programs effectively. Observer
contractors are not solely responsible to NMFS or to the State for the quality of their work performance; sometimes
they have conflicting responsibilities to their clients, to whom they are providing observers, and to NMFS or to the
State. The owners and operators of vessels and processing facilities now are responsible for making arrangements
with an observer contractor of their choice to meet observer requirements and for paying the costs of observers directly
to that contractor. This direct business relationship, and the ability of an owner or operator to select among the
group of contractors, mean that the contractors and, indirectly, the observers, work for the operations they are
observing. This relationship could provide a means for an operation to reward or penalize contractors and their observers
and thus negatively influence the work performance of the observers and quality of the data collected. This appearance
of a conflict of interest could reduce the credibility of observer data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To resolve these problems, the Council initiated development of the Research Plan. A draft EA/RIR for the Research
Plan was initially reviewed and approved for public distribution and comment by the Council and its advisory bodies
at their January 15&hyph;17, 1991, meetings. After reviewing written comments and advice from its advisory bodies,
and hearing public testimony at its meetings of April 23&hyph;26, 1991, the Council further refined the Research
Plan. A revised EA/RIR was reviewed and approved for public distribution and comment by the Council and its advisory
bodies at their April 20&hyph;26, 1992, meetings. After reviewing written comments, obtaining further advice from
its advisory bodies, and hearing public testimony at its June 23&hyph;28, 1992, meeting, the Council adopted the
Research Plan and recommended that it be submitted to the Secretary for review. The EA/RIR was updated in December
1993 to reflect newly available information. The Council approved the Research Plan as described in this proposed
rule at its December 1993 meeting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Provide a framework for an observer program for the Alaska groundfish fisheries and the Pacific halibut fishery
to accommodate inseason management and stock assessment needs, and to provide accurate, real-time data of sufficient
quality to implement an individual vessel incentive program developed to meet specified management objectives
of the Council; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide a framework for an observer program for Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries
to accommodate inseason management needs, monitor industry compliance with Federal and State regulations, and
collect biological and management data necessary to achieve the sustained yield of the crab resource without overfishing;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Ensure that the groundfish and crab observer programs are efficient and cost effective, that any increased costs
are commensurate with the quality and usefulness of the data to be derived from any revisions to the programs, and that
such changes are necessary to meet fishery management needs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provide for cooperation and coordination between the groundfish observer program administered by NMFS and the
crab observer program administered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Determination of Research Plan Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS would annually establish a Research Plan fee percentage for the upcoming calendar year. As described in this
preamble, the fee percentage would be based on standard exvessel prices by species and projections of the following:
(1) Retained catches by species (i.e., catch retained by either at-sea or shoreside processors) in all Research Plan
fisheries; (2) observer program costs; and (3) the surplus in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund (Fund), other
sources of funding for the Research Plan, and nonpayments. After consulting with the Council and State, NMFS would
publish the fee percentage and the values of the variables on which it is based in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite comments. After considering comments received and again consulting with the Council and the State, NMFS
would publish final values in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard Exvessel Prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS would annually establish standard exvessel prices for species harvested in Research Plan fisheries. These
prices would be used in estimating the total exvessel value of the Research Plan fisheries for the coming year and in
assessing fees. The standard exvessel prices would be based on: (1) Exvessel price information for the most recent
12-month period for which data are available, (2) factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the upcoming
calendar year, and (3) any other relevant information that may affect expected exvessel prices during the upcoming
calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retained Catch.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS would project retained catch, by species, for the Research Plan fisheries annually, using the best available
information concerning expected catches and discards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Total Exvessel Value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS would annually calculate the total exvessel value of retained catches for Research Plan fisheries as the sum
of the products of the standard exvessel prices and projected retained catches, for all Research Plan species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Observer Program Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS and ADF&amp;G would each prepare an annual budget that identifies expected recoverable Research Plan costs
for the upcoming calendar year. Recoverable costs identified in each budget would include: (1) Costs for observer
training, certification, briefing, and debriefing; (2) costs for stationing observers, including travel, salaries,
benefits, and insurance; (3) costs for data collection, transmission, input, processing, and management; and (4)
contract services and general program operational costs, excluding overhead. The estimated budget would be based
on anticipated observer coverage and the anticipated costs directly incurred in carrying out the Research Plan.
The observer program costs also would include the costs associated with a risk-sharing pool to provide comprehensive
insurance coverage for vessels and owners if such an insurance program is established under section 313 of the Magnuson
Act (see Risk-sharing Pool, in this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Surplus Funds, Other Sources of Funding, and Fee Nonpayment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Annually, NMFS would project each of the following: (1) The surplus that would be in the Fund at the end of the current
calendar year, (2) the funds that would be available from other sources for use in funding the Research Plan during
the upcoming calendar year, and (3) the nonpayment rate on fees assessed under the Research Plan during the upcoming
calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculation of the Fee Percentage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Magnuson Act, the fee percentage established to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan may not
exceed 2 percent of the exvessel value of fish harvested under the authority of the Council (except salmon), including
shellfish and the Northern Pacific halibut fishery. Annually, the fee percentage for the upcoming calendar year
will be set equal to the lesser of 2 percent of the exvessel value of retained catch in the Research Plan fisheries or
the fee percentage calculated using the equation described above and set out at &sect;677.11(a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the fee percentage calculated using this formula is greater than 2 percent, there would be a funding shortfall due
to the 2 percent limit in the Magnuson Act. This would require a reevaluation of the levels of coverage that would be
required and funded. Available funds would be utilized to address the Research Plan objectives in the following priority:
(1) Status of stock assessments (i.e., collection of data on total catch, species composition, size, sex, and age);
(2) inseason management; (3) bycatch monitoring; and (4) vessel incentive programs and regulatory compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Fee Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors would be responsible for collecting all fee assessments and for paying them bimonthly (i.e., every 2 months).
Section 313 of the Magnuson Act stipulates that fees shall be assessed against all fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors
participating in Research Plan fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council, including those not required to
have observers. Fee assessments would not apply to fish, except halibut, caught in the territorial sea (0&hyph;3
miles), or to any fish caught in internal waters of the State. Recordkeeping and reporting requirement changes that
would require processors to indicate if fish are caught in Federal or State waters will be developed prior to implementation
of the fee collection system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Catcher vessels would be expected to pay half of the fee liabilities on their retained catches to the processor(s)
responsible for making the bimonthly fee assessment payments to NMFS. NMFS would calculate bimonthly fee assessments
by multiplying the fee percentage times the standard exvessel price times the round weight or round-weight equivalent
of all retained catches, by species, in Research Plan fisheries. For example, if the fee percentage for Research Plan
fisheries were 1.00 percent, and the standard exvessel price of pollock were $0.09/lb ($0.20/kg), a retained catch
of 500,000 lbs (227,727 kg) of pollock would result in a fee assessment due from the processor of:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Retained catch is defined as the catch retained by either at-sea or shoreside processors. The round weight of fish
delivered to shoreside processors would be determined from scale weights. Standard product recovery rates would
be used to derive round-weight equivalents when other than whole fish is delivered to shoreside processors. Standard
product recovery rates also would be used to calculate round-weight equivalents of groundfish and halibut harvested
by or delivered to at-sea processors. For crab at-sea processors, scale weights of sample catches would be used to
calculate weight of retained catch. NMFS is developing a regulatory amendment to establish standard product recovery
rates that would be used throughout the industry to calculate round-weight equivalents of retained catch. Assuming
Secretarial approval, NMFS anticipates that standard product recovery rates will be effective by 1995. If a more
reliable system for determining total weights is implemented in the future, these regulations would be amended accordingly.
Public comment is specifically encouraged on this aspect of the proposed Research Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS would obtain values for the weight of retained catch to be used in calculating fee assessments through existing
data reporting systems. Groundfish data would be obtained from Weekly Production Reports or from ADF&amp;G fish
tickets for those vessel operators who are not required to submit Weekly Production Reports under Federal regulations
but who sell catch directly to consumers. Crab data would be obtained from ADF&amp;G Weekly Processor Reports, fish
tickets, or other required reports. Halibut data would be obtained from the IPHC or from Individual Fishing Quota
(IFQ) reports, when available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS would bill processors bimonthly for their fee assessments. The bimonthly periods would be determined on the
basis of weekly reporting periods. NMFS is preparing a rule to revise the definition of a weekly reporting period.
Assuming its approval, the 1995 bimonthly periods would be January 1 through February 25; February 26 through April
29; April 30 through July 1; July 2 through September 2; September 3 through October 28; and October 29 through December
31. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) would need to receive payments within 30 days of the date
the bill is issued. Interest and administrative charges would be charged for late payments. Payments would be deposited
in the Fund within the U.S. Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A processor would be required to notify the Regional Director, in writing, within 30 days of issuance of the bill, if
any billed amount is disputed. The processor would be responsible for paying the undisputed amount of the bill within
30 days of its issuance, and for providing documentation supporting the disputed amount claimed to be under- or over-billed.
Within 60 days of the date of issuance of the disputed bill, the Regional Director would review the disputed bill and
the documentation provided by the processor, and would notify the processor of his determination. If the Regional
Director determines a billing error has occurred, the processor's account would be rectified by credit or subsequent
billing. If the Regional Director determines a billing error has not occurred, the balance of the disputed bill would
be due within 15 days of issuance of the determination. Interest and administrative charges would be assessed for
payments that are not received within 15 days. Processor permits would not be issued until all fee assessments are
paid. (See Permit and Recordkeeping Requirements in this preamble).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council recommended requiring guarantees equal to the maximum estimated quarterly fee assessment for the upcoming
calendar year to secure anticipated fee liabilities, in the form of prepayments, letter of credit, surety bond, or
lien on property. NMFS believes that the requirement of such guarantees is premature and could be burdensome to the
industry, particularly to smaller enterprises, and costly to administer. Small or marginally profitable enterprises
could have difficulty in securing such guarantees. There are irrecoverable costs associated with guarantees such
as letters of credit and surety bonds. Some guarantees may be of limited value in ensuring necessary cash flows and
achieving the objectives of the Research Plan. Collection could also be difficult to accomplish in a timely and cost-effective
manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, NMFS is proposing a simplified system to encourage timely fee assessment payments by processors that would
consist of: (1) Bimonthly billing, (2) semi-annual processor permitting with a requirement that all Research Plan
fee assessments must be current before a permit would be issued, (3) a prohibition against processing landings from
Research Plan fisheries without a valid processing permit, and (4) a prohibition against delivery of catch from Research
Plan fisheries to a processor not possessing a valid processing permit. This system also has the advantage of greatly
simplified reporting and recordkeeping requirements for processors and reduced administrative costs for NMFS.
The extent of nonpayment of fee assessments, which is inherent in any fee collection system, would be taken into account
in determining the fee percentage rate for the following year. The proposed system is designed to minimize such nonpayment.

First Year of the Research Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the first, or start-up, year of the Research Plan, NMFS would accumulate necessary start-up funds in the Fund.
Fees would be assessed against all fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating in Research Plan fisheries
under the authority of the Council. Processors would be responsible for collecting all fee assessments and for paying
them bimonthly. The observer coverage requirements in the Federal Observer Plan and existing State Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab regulations (5 AAC 39.645) would remain in effect during the start-up year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), all processors and vessels participating in Research Plan fisheries
would pay the full fee assessment. Vessel operators and processors that currently are required to carry observers
under the Federal Observer Plan and under State regulations would continue to do so during the first year of the Research
Plan. NMFS would issue rebates to those who paid directly for required observer coverage during the first year of the
Research Plan. The rebate per standard observer day would equal either the actual payment to an observer contractor
per standard observer day or the standardized cost of a standard observer day, whichever is less. A standard observer
day is defined as all or part of a 24-hour period that begins at 0001 hours Alaska local time (A.l.t.) and ends at 2400
A.l.t., during which an observer is stationed on a vessel or at a shoreside facility for purposes of complying with
observer coverage requirements set forth in the proposed rule at &sect;677.10(a). A standard observer day cannot
be attributed to more than one vessel or shoreside facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standardized cost of a standard observer day would be based on the estimate(s) of the cost per observer day used
to calculate both the total cost of the Research Plan and the fee percentage during 1995. Proposed standardized cost(s)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public review and comment as part of the annual Research Plan specification process set forth at &sect;677.11
of the proposed rule. At this time, NMFS anticipates that standardized cost(s) could range between $170 and $265 per
day, depending on whether 100 percent or 30 percent observer coverage is obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rebates issued for vessel or processor observer coverage may exceed Research Plan fee payments. However, issuance
of a rebate to a processor would be dependent on the processor being current with respect to submitting its fee payments.
The rebates would be based on information provided to NMFS by observer contractors on an Observer Coverage Rebate
Application (Form FPP&hyph;2). This information would include the number of standard observer days paid for by each
vessel or processor and the amount paid for those observer days. The required information would be submitted by each
observer contractor within 15 days after the end of each calendar month in which it received payments for providing
observers. Initial rebates would not be issued before mid-year, to allow for the collection of sufficient funding
for the rebate program. Subsequent rebates for 1995 observer coverage would be issued on a more regular basis, e.g.
bimonthly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS believes that a fund equal to approximately two-thirds of the estimated annual cost needed to operate the Research
Plan is the minimum amount needed to begin full operation of the Research Plan and to ensure that cash flow is adequate
to meet start-up costs. Assuming approval of regulations implementing the Research Plan, full implementation of
the observer and fee portions of the Research Plan is anticipated to begin January 1, 1996.

Permit and Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the first year of the Research Plan, most of the burden of recordkeeping would rest with processors, who would
be responsible for collecting and paying the bimonthly Research Plan fee assessment when billed by NMFS. During the
first year of the Research Plan, additional reporting requirements would be implemented for observer contractors
to support the rebate program for direct observer costs. The rebate program and associated recordkeeping requirements
are described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All processors of Research Plan fisheries would need a Federal Processing Permit. A Federal Processing Permit Application
(Form FPP&hyph;1) would be required to obtain a processing permit, and would serve to gather information about the
processor and its owner. Fishermen who sell their catch directly to the public at a dock, roadside, or elsewhere would
be considered processors under the Research Plan. Each processing vessel or shoreside facility would be required
to submit a separate permit application, even if several vessels or facilities are owned by the same company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits would be issued for each of the two 6-month periods_January 1 through June 30, and July 1 through December 31.
No permit would be issued until the permit application is complete and all fee assessments paid. Processors that have
paid their accounts and submitted complete permit applications would be issued a permit within 30 days. Permits would
not be issued to those processors not submitting complete applications or to those whose accounts are past due, until
their applications are complete and their accounts are paid. Processing fish from Research Plan fisheries without
a valid permit, or delivering fish from Research Plan fisheries to a processor not possessing a valid permit, would
be prohibited. NMFS would make available to the public a list of those processors holding valid permits to process
fish from Research Plan fisheries.

Observer Coverage
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), observer coverage levels in the groundfish fishery would be as currently
required by the Federal Observer Plan. All king and Tanner crab catcher/processors and mothership processors in
the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area would continue to carry observers under the State Shellfish Onboard Observer
Program. Observer coverage would not be required for the halibut fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starting with the second year of the Research Plan (1996), NMFS would annually determine the level of observer coverage
necessary to achieve the objectives of the Research Plan. NMFS would consider the amount of available funds, as well
as the objectives of the program, in determining the appropriate observer coverage levels. NMFS would annually present
an analysis of observer coverage, including criteria for selection of vessels to carry observers if coverage is less
than 100 percent, to the Council, and to the State in the case of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner
crab fisheries. NMFS would then publish the proposed levels of coverage in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite comments. State costs for observer coverage in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner
crab fisheries allowable under the Magnuson Act would be paid from fees collected from all Research Plan fisheries.
After considering comments received and again consulting with the Council, and with the State in the case of the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, NMFS would publish the final levels of observer coverage
for the upcoming year in the

Inseason Changes in Observer Coverage
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regional Director may increase or decrease the observer coverage requirements for the groundfish, halibut,
and crab observer programs at any time during the effective period of the Research Plan to improve the accuracy, reliability,
and availability of observer data, and to ensure solvency of the observer program, so long as the conditions set forth
in section 313 of the Magnuson Act are met, and based on one or more of the following findings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A significant change in fishing methods, times, or areas for a specific fishery or fleet component has occurred,
or is likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A significant change in catch or bycatch composition for a specific fishery or fleet component has occurred, or
is likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Unanticipated shortfalls in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund require decreased observer coverage to maintain
solvency of the observer programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. An increase in observer coverage is necessary to ensure or improve data availability or quality in order to meet
specific fishery management objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any decrease in observer coverage due to unanticipated funding shortfalls must be consistent with the following
priorities: (a) Status of stock assessments (i.e., collection of data on total catch, species composition, size,
sex, and age); (b) inseason management; (c) bycatch monitoring; and (d) vessel incentive programs and regulatory
compliance. Any increased costs must be commensurate with the quality and usefulness of the data to be derived from
any revised program and necessary to meet fishery management needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director would consult with the Commissioner of ADF&amp;G prior to making inseason changes in observer
coverage level for the crab observer program. NMFS would publish changes in observer coverage requirements in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, with the reasons for the changes and any special instructions to vessels required to carry observers, at least 10
calendar days prior to their implementation.

Groundfish and Halibut Observers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Groundfish and halibut observers would be either employees of NMFS or employees of NMFS observer contractors. Observer
contracts would be subject to a competitive bid process and would comply with Federal and agency procurement regulations.
A minimum of three contractors would be used in accordance with the procurement regulations, if cost effective, and
if three or more bidders are qualified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Observers would possess the education and specific training as specified in the contracts issued by the Federal Government
to provide groundfish or halibut observers. The observers' duties are described in detail in the NMFS observer manual,
which is updated as necessary and is available from the NMFS Observer Program, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, 7600
Sand Point Way N.E., BIN C15700, Building 4, Seattle, WA 98115. Observer duties may include the collection of data
on catch, effort, bycatch, and discards of finfish and shellfish, including prohibited species catches, to facilitate
inseason management. Observers may collect information on gear, processing, or other fishing information; biological
samples to determine species, length, weight, age, sex composition of catch, and predator-prey interactions; or
any other information needed to manage the fisheries. They may collect data on marine mammals, seabirds, and other
species as appropriate. Information obtained from observers would also be used to monitor compliance with fishing
and related regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director would review fishery monitoring programs and report to the Council on methods to improve data
collection and sampling techniques and to provide for real-time data transmission from the groundfish and halibut
fleet, including daily reporting and other measures as appropriate to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fishery
monitoring programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule was published on April 29, 1994, (59 FR 22133) that authorizes NMFS to disclose specified observer data
on prohibited species bycatch or bycatch rates. This authority would continue under the Research Plan and is included
in this proposed rule (&sect;677.10(f)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Crab observers would either be employees of ADF&amp;G, or employees of NMFS observer contractors. The observers
would be required to possess the education and specific training requirements as specified in the contracts issued
by the Federal Government to provide crab observers. The observers' duties are described in detail in the ADF&amp;G
observer manual, which will be updated as necessary. The ADF&amp;G observer manual is available from ADF&amp;G,
Box 308, Dutch Harbor, AK 99692&hyph;0308. Crab observer duties may include the collection of data on catch, effort,
bycatch, and discards of finfish and shellfish to facilitate inseason management. Observers may also collect biological
samples to determine information such as species, length, weight, age, sex composition of catch, predator-prey
interactions, or any other biological information needed to manage the fisheries. They may also collect data on marine
mammals, seabirds, and other species as appropriate. Crab observers also provide an effective means to ensure management
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State would review its fishery monitoring and data transmission programs in conjunction with NMFS, to coordinate
methods to improve data collection and sampling techniques, provide for real-time data transmission from the fleet,
including daily reporting, improve the accuracy and efficiency of fishery monitoring programs, and improve coordination
between State and Federal agencies. Initially, data collection, transmission, and input programs would be the same
as specified under existing State regulations and guidelines to facilitate inseason management.

Notification of Observer Contractors by Processors and Operators of Vessels Required To Carry Observers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors and operators of vessels required to carry observers under the Research Plan would be responsible for
meeting their observer coverage requirements. To ensure that an observer will be available, processors and vessel
operators would be required to notify the appropriate agency or observer contractor, as identified by NMFS, not less
than 60 days prior to their need for an observer. This notification must be in writing or facsimile copy. A second notification
to the appropriate observer contractor, in writing, facsimile copy, or by telephone, must be made not less than 10
days prior to the need for an observer, to make final arrangements for observer deployment. Proposed ports from which
observers may embark/disembark are Akutan, Atka, Beaver Inlet, Chignik, Cordova, Craig, Dutch Harbor, Homer, Juneau,
Ketchikan, Kenai, King Cove, Kodiak, Petersburg, Sand Point, Seward, Sitka, St. George, St. Paul, Valdez, Wrangell,
and Yakutat. Ports were selected using the following criteria: (1) Previous selection by observer contractors,
(2) accessibility and transportation costs, and (3) availability of overnight accommodations. Public comments
on this list of ports is specifically encouraged. This list would be reviewed annually by NMFS, in consultation with
the Council and the State, during the annual budget review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), observer coverage requirements would be as described in &sect;677.10(a).
NMFS would publish subsequent observer coverage requirements, along with the names of the observer contractors,
information for contacting contractors, and a list of embarkment/disembarkment ports for observers, annually
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Coordination Between the Federal Groundfish Observer Program and the State King and Tanner Crab Observer Program
Under the Research Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under authority of the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands,
the State king and Tanner crab observer program for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area was designed by the Board
and is administered by ADF&amp;G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS and ADF&amp;G would form a work group to maximize efficiency in administration and implementation of the groundfish,
halibut, and king and Tanner crab observer programs. The University of Alaska, as an observer training entity, would
be a member of this work group when required to help in the development of observer training and debriefing procedures.
The work group would review costs and identify possible cost-saving measures, including the use of contractors to
perform some or all of the duties under the Research Plan, other than briefing or debriefing. The work group also would
review the costs and benefits of training observers in Alaska or elsewhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The work group would address items including: (1) Development of consistent, cost-effective, and compatible observer
training and debriefing procedures; (2) development of a consistent data collection, transmission, and processing
system, including a single database available to both agencies on a real-time basis; and (3) identification of costs
that are appropriate for reimbursement to the State pursuant to the Magnuson Act. NMFS and ADF&amp;G would annually
provide to the Council a report detailing steps taken to improve overall coordination between the two observer programs
and to improve administrative efficiency.

The Council Chairman would establish an Observer Oversight Committee (Committee) to provide advice to the Council,
the Board, the Commissioner of ADF&amp;G, and the Regional Director on general provisions of the observer and fee
portions of the Research Plan. NMFS, with the assistance of ADF&amp;G, would annually provide Research Plan reports
and budget documents to the Committee. The Committee would consist of industry representatives from the following
groups: Factory trawler, catcher trawler, shoreside processor, crab catcher vessel, freezer longliner, non-freezer
longliner, crab catcher-processor, vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) in length overall, observers, observer contractors,
and an independent observer training representative. The Committee would meet with NMFS and ADF&amp;G staff within
the annual cycle of the Research Plan to review the reports and budgets and provide input to the Council on fee levels
and observer coverage needs. The Committee would not have oversight of the daily operations of the Federal and State
observer programs.

to provide comprehensive commercial insurance coverage for vessels and owners, and the availability of such insurance
for vessels and owners, against liability from civil suits by observers. If the Secretary determines that a risk-sharing
pool is feasible, any implementing regulations would be codified at subpart B of 50 CFR part 677.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Although
it would affect all firms in the Research Plan fisheries, it would not decrease revenues by more than 2 percent. Since
costs are approximately equal to revenues in the Research Plan fisheries, costs are not expected to go up by more than
2 percent. Thus, while a substantial number of small entities would be affected, the effect is not expected to be economically
significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. These
collections of information have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval. Public reporting
burden for each year of this collection is estimated to average 0.5 hours per response for completing the semi-annual
Federal Processing Permit Application, 0.25 hours per response for notifying contractors of needs for observers,
and 1.0 hour per response to provide information to document claims of disputed bills. For the first year of the Research
Plan, completion of Observer Coverage Rebate Application forms is estimated to average 0.16 hours per response.
All reporting burden estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding
these burden estimates, or any other aspect of the data requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden,
to NMFS (see

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fee percentage will be set annually under procedures at &sect;677.11, such that the total fees equal the lesser
of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The cost of implementing the Research Plan, including nonpayments, minus any other Federal funds that support
the observer program and any existing surplus in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bimonthly fee assessment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Research Plan bimonthly fee assessment is the fee percentage established pursuant to &sect;677.11 for the calendar
year, multiplied by the standard exvessel price established pursuant to &sect;677.11 for the calendar year, multiplied
by the round weight or round-weight equivalent of retained catch for each species from Research Plan fisheries during
the bimonthly period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fee assessment payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each processor that retains fish for processing from a Research Plan fishery must collect and pay the Research Plan
fee. NMFS will bill each processor of Research Plan fisheries for bimonthly fee assessments, based on the best available
information on retained catches processed during that bimonthly period. Bimonthly fee assessment payments must
be in the form of certified check, draft, or money order payable in U.S. currency to ``NOAA-NMFS.'' The Regional Director
must receive payment in full within 30 calendar days from the date of issuance of each bimonthly fee assessment bill.
Payments will be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund within the U.S. Treasury.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disputed fee assessments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor must notify the Regional Director, in writing, within 30 days of issuance of the bimonthly fee assessment
bill, if any portion of the bimonthly fee assessment bill is disputed. The processor must pay the undisputed amount
of the bimonthly fee assessment bill within 30 days of its issuance, and provide documentation supporting the disputed
portion claimed to be under- or over-billed. The Regional Director will review the disputed bimonthly fee assessment
bill and the documentation provided by the processor, and will notify the processor of his determination within 60
days of the date of issuance of the disputed bimonthly fee assessment bill. If the Regional Director determines a billing
error had occurred, the processor's account will be rectified by credit or issuance of a corrected bimonthly fee assessment
bill. If the Regional Director determines that a billing error had not occurred, the balance of the disputed bimonthly
fee assessment bill is due within 15 days of issuance of the determination. Late charges will be assessed for payments
not received within 15 days. If the processor does not dispute the amount of the bimonthly fee assessment bill within
30 days of its issuance, the bimonthly fee assessment will be final, and will be due to the United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Late charges. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NOAA Office of the Comptroller shall assess late charges in the form of interest and administrative charges for
late payment of fee assessments. Interest will accrue on the unpaid amount at a percentage rate established by the
Federal Reserve Board and applied to funds held by the U.S. Treasury for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that
the payment is overdue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide, at no cost to observers, the State of Alaska, or the United States, accommodations and food on the vessel
for the observer or observers that are equivalent to those provided for officers of the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Maintain safe conditions on the vessel for the protection of observers during the time observers are on board the
vessel, by adhering to all U.S. Coast Guard and other applicable rules, regulations, or statutes pertaining to safe
operation of the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Allow observers to use the vessel's communication equipment and personnel, on request, for the entry, transmission,
and receipt of work-related messages, at no cost to the observers, the State of Alaska, or the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Allow observers access to, and the use of, the vessel's navigation equipment and personnel, on request, to determine
the vessel's position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Allow observers free and unobstructed access to the vessel's bridge, trawl or working decks, holding bins, processing
areas, freezer spaces, weight scales, cargo holds, and any other space that may be used to hold, process, weigh, or
store fish or fish products at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Notify observers at least 15 minutes before fish are brought on board, or fish and fish products are transferred
from the vessel, to allow sampling the catch or observing the transfer, unless the observers specifically request
not to be notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Allow observers to inspect and copy the vessel's daily fishing logbook, daily cumulative production logbook,
transfer logbook, any other logbook or document required by regulations, printouts or tallies of scale weights,
scale calibration records, bin sensor readouts, and production records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable observers to carry out their duties, including, but not limited
to, assisting the observers in measuring decks, codends, and holding bins; providing the observers with a safe work
area adjacent to the sample collection site; providing crab observers with the necessary equipment to conduct sampling,
such as scales, fish totes, and baskets; assisting in collecting bycatch when requested by the observers; assisting
in collecting and carrying baskets of fish when requested by observers; and allowing observers to determine the sex
of fish when this procedure will not decrease the value of a significant portion of the catch.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a council-prepared amendment
to a fishery management plan be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval.
The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that
the document is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment in determining
approvability of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Amendment 7 proposes the following actions. (1) The eastern zone commercial quota for the Gulf migratory group of
king mackerel would be divided into equal quotas for Florida east and west coast fisheries. The Florida east coast
sub-zone would encompass the waters off the east coast of Florida from a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler
County, Florida boundary (29

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N. lat.). The east coast sub-zone would exist from November 1 through March 31, when the boundary separating
the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler
County, Florida boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the Florida west coast sub-zone would encompass the waters
off the southeast, south, and west coasts of Florida from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary to a line extending
directly south from the Alabama/Florida boundary (87

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->

groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly west from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary (25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;48
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N. lat.), the west coast sub-zone would extend from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary to the Alabama/Florida
boundary. (2) The west coast sub-zone quota would be further subdivided into equal quotas for fishermen harvesting
with hook-and-line and those using run-around gillnet gear. (3) Persons would be allowed to fish under the gillnet
quota in the west coast sub-zone only aboard vessels that have endorsements on their Federal commercial mackerel
permits to fish with gillnets in that sub-zone. All harvest of Gulf group king mackerel in the west coast sub-zone by
vessels with such an endorsement would be counted against the gillnet quota.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to amend FAR policies and clauses on Prompt Payment. This proposed rule,
in combination with changes made by Federal Acquisition Circular 84&hyph;45, dated March 31, 1989, will complete
the implementation of changes made in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 (Revised), dated December 12, 1989, to comply with
the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100&hyph;496). Changes are also proposed to clarify, simplify,
and correct inconsistencies in the existing FAR text and clauses. This regulatory action was not subject to Office
of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84&hyph;45 published a final FAR rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 54 FR 13332, March 31, 1989, to implement changes required by the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988 (Public Law
100&hyph;496). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implemented the statutory requirements by revising OMB
Circular A&hyph;125, Prompt Payment. The Circular was published as a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 21, 1989, and became effective 30 days after publication. OMB's final guidance differed somewhat from
earlier proposed coverage which served as the basis for the FAR changes published in FAC 84&hyph;45. This proposed
FAR rule implements the guidance published in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 (Revised).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major FAR changes proposed include: (1) Clarifying policy on partial payments for partial performance by establishing
coverage at FAR 32.102(d) and 32.903(f); (2) revising and adding definitions at FAR 32.902 to be in consonance with
definitions in OMB Circular A&hyph;125 and to make related editorial changes; (3) adding coverage at FAR 32.904 to
address an ongoing problem with contracts containing more than one set of payment terms; (4) clarifying policy at
FAR 32.905(a)(1)(ii) concerning use of extended acceptance periods; (5) adding coverage at FAR 32.905(c)(6) to
address construction prime contractor certification requirements under the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;5; (6) adding
coverage at FAR 32.905(j) to address the use and payment of ``mixed'' invoices; (7) adding coverage at FAR 32.907&hyph;1(b)(3)
concerning interest penalties in relation to electronic funds transfers; (8) adding coverage at FAR 32.907&hyph;1(g)
concerning additional interest penalties and contractor demands for such penalties; (9) adding coverage at FAR
32.910 to address construction contractors' payment of interest on unearned amounts under the clauses at FAR 52.232&hyph;5
and 52.232&hyph;27; and (10) revising the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;5 to include the specific criteria required
by A&hyph;125 for construction contractors' requests for progress payments. FAR clauses 52.232&hyph;5, 52.232&hyph;8,
and 52.232&hyph;25, 52.232&hyph;26, 52.232&hyph;27, and 52.232&hyph;28 are amended to reflect the proposed FAR
text changes. In addition, numerous changes are proposed to clarify, simplify, and correct inconsistencies in the
existing FAR text and clauses. (Note: The requirements that no late payment penalty payments be made to certain foreign
vendors were removed from the FAR by FAC 90&hyph;20, Item XIII, March 10, 1994, 59 FR 11368.)

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to FAR 32.102, subpart 32.9, and related part 52 clauses at 52.232&hyph;5, 52.232&hyph;8, 52.232&hyph;25,
52.232&hyph;26, 52.232&hyph;27, and 52.232&hyph;28 may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the proposed rule will apply to all small businesses who contract with the Federal Government and to all small
businesses who enter into construction contracts with contractors holding prime Federal construction contracts.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for
Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments
are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subparts will also be considered in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

et seq.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 32.102 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->

(d) Partial payments for accepted supplies and services that are only a part of the contract requirements are authorized
under section 305 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (41 U.S.C. 255). OMB Circular A&hyph;125,
Prompt Payment, requires agencies to pay for partial delivery of supplies or partial performance of services unless
specifically prohibited by the contract. Although partial payments are generally treated as a method of payment
and not as a method of contract financing, using partial payments can assist contractors to participate in Government
contracts without, or with minimal, contract financing. When appropriate, contract statements of work and pricing
arrangements shall be designed to permit acceptance and payment for discrete portions of the work, as soon as accepted
(but see 32.903(f)(2)).

 as used in this subpart, means calendar day, including weekends and holidays, unless otherwise indicated. (However,
see 32.903(e)(3) concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Designated billing office,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as used in this subpart, means the office or person (governmental or nongovernmental) designated in the contract
where the contractor first submits invoices and contract financing requests. This might be the Government disbursing
office, contract administration office, office accepting the supplies delivered or services performed by the contractor,
contract audit office, or a nongovernmental agent. In some cases, different offices might be designated to receive
invoices and contract financing requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discount for prompt payment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an invoice payment reduction voluntarily offered by the contractor, in conjunction with the clause at 52.232&hyph;8,
Discounts for Prompt Payment, if payment is made by the Government prior to the due date. The due date is calculated
from the date of the contractor's invoice. If the contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date is calculated
from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice
with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday
when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be
made on the following business day and a discount may be taken.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All solicitations and contracts subject to this subpart shall specify payment procedures, payment due dates,
and interest penalties for late invoice payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Government shall not make invoice and contract financing payments earlier than 7 days prior to the due dates
specified in the contract unless the agency head, or designee, determines to make earlier payment on a case-by-case
basis (see 32.908 for required clauses).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment will be based on receipt of a proper invoice or contract financing request and satisfactory contract performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Agency procedures shall ensure that, when specifying due dates, full consideration is given to the time reasonably
required by Government officials to fulfill their administrative responsibilities under the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) Checks shall be mailed on the same day they are dated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Payments made by electronic funds transfer shall be specified by the Government (see 32.902 definition of

(3) When the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government
business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day without incurring a late
payment interest penalty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f)(1) Contracting officers shall, where the nature of the work permits, write contract statements of work and pricing
arrangements that allow contractors to deliver, and receive invoice payments for, discrete portions of the work
as soon as completed and found acceptable by the Government (see 32.102(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unless specifically prohibited by the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment for accepted partial deliveries
of supplies or partial performance of services that comply with all applicable contract requirements and for which
prices can be calculated from the contract terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Under some types of contracts, such as many cost-reimbursement contracts, partial payments cannot be made because
the invoice price cannot be determined until after settlement of total contract costs and other contract-wide final
arrangements. However, interim payments or contract financing payments may be made in accordance with the terms
of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Discounts for prompt payment offered by the contractor shall be taken only when payments are made within the discount
period specific by the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Agencies shall pay an interest penalty, without request from the contractor, for late invoice payments or improperly
taken discounts for prompt payment. The interest penalty shall be absorbed within funds available for administration
or operation of the program for which the penalty was incurred. The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely
payment does not relieve an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties or the additional interest penalties
discussed in 32.903(i) and 32.907&hyph;1(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For contracts awarded after October 1, 1989, if the interest penalty is not paid within 10 days after it is due and
the contractor makes a written demand for payment within 40 days after payment of the principal amount due, agencies
shall pay an additional penalty amount, which shall be calculated in accordance with 32.907&hyph;1(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) If the contractor has assigned a contractor identifier (such as an invoice number) to an invoice or financing request,
each payment shall use the contractor identifier (in addition to any Government or contract information) in describing
any payment made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) May adopt different payment procedures to accommodate unique circumstances, provided such procedures are consistent
with the policies in this subpart; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Shall inform contractors of points of contact within their cognizant payment offices to enable contractors to
obtain status of invoices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Contracting officers, in drafting solicitations and contracts, shall identify for each contract line item number,
subline item number, or exhibit line item number_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Which of the applicable Prompt Payment clauses applies to each item when the solicitation or contract contains
items which will be subject to different payment terms; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicable Prompt Payment food category (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which item numbers are meat or meat food products, which are perishable agricultural commodities, etc.), when using
the clause at 52.232&hyph;25 which contains multiple payment terms for various classes of foods and edible products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the due date for making an invoice payment
by the designated payment office shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the contractor (except as provided
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section); or the 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services
performed by the contractor, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance shall be deemed

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance
shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has delivered supplies or performed
services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity,
quality, or contractor compliance with a contract requirement. In the event that actual acceptance occurs within
the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of
acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept
supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
Except in the case of a contract for the purchase of a commercial item or service as defined in 15.804&hyph;3(c)(3),
including a brand name commercial item for authorized resale (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
commissary items), the contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance in the solicitation
and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the supplies
furnished or to evaluate the services performed. The contract file shall indicate the justification for extending
the constructive acceptance period beyond 7 days. Extended acceptance periods shall not be a routine agency practice
but shall be used only when necessary to permit proper Government inspection and testing of the supplies delivered
or services rendered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt,
the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided a proper invoice
is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The due date for making payments on contracts that contain the clause at 52.232&hyph;10, Payments under Fixed-Price
Architect-Engineer Contracts, shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The due date for work or services completed by the contractor shall be the later of the following two events:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor. On a final invoice
where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
release of claims), acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the settlement. For the sole
purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed
to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or services in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also paragraph (b)(4) of this section). In the event that actual
acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be
based on the actual date of acceptance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The due date for progress payments shall be the 30th day after Government approval of contractor estimates of work
or services accomplished. For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor,
Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after contractor estimates have
been received by the designated billing office (see also paragraph (b)(4) of this section). In the event that actual
approval occurs within the constructive approval period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based
on the actual date of approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice or payment request with the actual date of receipt
at the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice or payment
request, provided a proper invoice or payment request is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality,
or contractor compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)
of this section are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality,
contractor compliance with contract requirements, or the requested progress payment amount. These requirements
do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration
functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer
period for constructive acceptance or constructive approval, if required to afford the Government a reasonable
opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or to evaluate the services performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The due date for making payments on construction contracts shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The due date for making progress payments based on contracting officer approval of the estimated amount and value
of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project, shall be 14 days after receipt
of a proper payment request by the designated billing office. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the
payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 14th day after
the date of the contractor's payment request, provided a proper payment request is received and there is no disagreement
over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements. The contracting officer may specify
a longer period in the solicitation and resulting contract if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity
to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance under the contract.
The contract file shall indicate the justification for extending the due date beyond 14 days. The contracting officer
or his representative shall not approve progress payment requests unless the certification and substantiation
of amounts requested are provided as required by the clause at 52.232&hyph;5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction
Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232&hyph;5,
Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, shall be as specified in the contract or, if not specified, 30
days after approval by the contracting officer for release to the contractor. This release of retained amounts shall
be based on the contracting officer's determination that satisfactory progress has been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The due date for final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work (including any retained amounts),
and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the Government (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated separately in
the contract) shall be as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Either the 30th day after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper invoice from the contractor, or the
30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor, whichever is later. If the
designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the
invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided a proper invoice
is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement action (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
release of contractor claims), acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract settlement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor for payments described in
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively
on the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the contract (see also paragraph (c)(5) of this section). In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive
acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section
are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality, contractor
compliance with contract requirements, or the requested amount. These requirements do not compel Government officials
to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment
prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive
acceptance or constructive approval in the solicitation and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government
a reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance
under the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Construction prime contracts contain special provisions concerning prime contractor payments to subcontractors,
along with special prime contractor certification requirements. The Office of Management and Budget has determined
that these certifications are not to be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor's performance. The certification
in 52.232&hyph;5(c) implements this determination; however, certificates are still acceptance if the contractor
deletes paragraph (c)(4) of 52.232&hyph;5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Due dates for payments of contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural
commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)),
as further defined in Public Law 98&hyph;181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry
meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day
after product delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)),
will be as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities
Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless
another date is specified in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)),
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than,
the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese
products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this
classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise about
the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices should be followed in specifying
a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing
industry practice is upon the bidder making the representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(8) of this section. If the invoice
does not comply with these requirements, the contractor must be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt
of the invoice at the designated billing office (3 days on contracts for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days on
contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared
from edible fats or oils). The reason that the invoice is not a proper invoice must be specified. If such notice is not
timely, then an adjusted due date for the purpose of determining an interest penalty, if any, will be established in
accordance with 32.907&hyph;1(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name and address of the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(f) All invoice payments shall be supported by a receiving report or any other Government documentation authorizing
payment. The agency receiving official should forward the receiving report or other Government documentation to
the designated payment office by the 5th working day after Government acceptance or approval, unless other arrangements
have been made. This period of time does not extend the due dates prescribed in 32.905. Acceptance should be completed
as expeditiously as possible. The receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment shall,
as a minimum, include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed.

Government certified invoice must also contain the information described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(6) of
this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When a discount for prompt payment is to be taken, payment will be made as close as possible to, but not later than,
the end of the discount period. Payment terms are specified in the clause at 52.232&hyph;8, Discounts for Prompt Payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) The interest penalty computation shall not include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The time taken by the Government to notify the contractor of a defective invoice, unless it exceeds the periods
prescribed in 32.905(e);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The time taken by the contractor to correct the invoice. If the designated billing office failed to notify the contractor
of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in 32.905(e), the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted
by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest
penalty owed the contractor will be based on this adjusted due date; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the contractor furnishes correct
electronic funds transfer data; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Government notifies the contractor of the defective data within 7 days after the Government receives notice that
the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.

(d) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g., tariffs). The rate in effect on the day after the due date shall
remain fixed during the period for which an interest penalty is calculated. This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation
Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. Information concerning this interest rate can be obtained from the Department
of the Treasury, Finance Management Branch, Washington, DC 20227, telephone (202) 208&hyph;1515. Interest calculations
shall be based upon a 360-day year. The interest penalty will accrue daily on the invoice payment amount approved by
the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment
date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment amount
and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. The interest penalty amount, interest
rate and the period for which the interest penalty was computed, will be separately stated by the designated payment
office on the check, in accompanying remittance advice, or for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) by an appropriate
electronic or other remittance advice. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating
interest penalties.

(g)(1) For contracts awarded on or after October 1, 1989, a penalty amount (calculated in accordance with paragraph
(g)(3) of this section) shall be paid, in addition to the interest penalty amount, only if the contractor_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is owed an interest penalty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and

(g)(2) of this section, postmarked not later than 40 days after the date the invoice amount is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demands must be postmarked on or before the 40th day after payment was made, except that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent, the demand must have been received and annotated with the date of receipt
by the designated payment office on or before the 40th day after payment was made, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation,
the demand's validity will be determined by the date the contractor has placed on the demand; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any original late payment interest penalty that is due
on or after January 22, 1990, except_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For additional penalties due on or before January 22, 1992, such penalties shall not exceed $2,500;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) After January 22, 1992, the additional penalty shall not exceed $5,000;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The additional penalty shall never be less than $25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the limits stated in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this
section, the amount of the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest penalty that would have
accrued in the absence of these limits, but shall not exceed the limits specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall be the interest penalty due on
each separate payment made for each separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty shall not be based
upon individual invoices unless the invoices are paid separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing
purposes, the maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made separately for each contract therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (for example, payments
under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) The Payments under Fixed-Price Construction clause (52.232&hyph;5), paragraph (d), and Prompt Payment for
Construction Contracts clause (52.232&hyph;27), subparagraph (e)(6), provide for the contractor to pay interest
on unearned amounts in certain circumstances. This interest shall be recovered from subsequent payments to the contractor.
Therefore, no demand for payment shall normally be made. Contracting officers shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compute the amount in accordance with the clause;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide the contractor with a final decision; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notify the payment office of the amount to be withheld.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The payment office shall be responsible for making the deduction of interest. Amounts collected in accordance
with these provisions shall revert to the Treasury of the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, at the time of receipt,
the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese
products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this
classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise about
the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a
contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing
industry practice is upon the bidder making the representation.

The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper
invoice must include the items listed in subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(viii) of this clause. If the invoice
does not comply with these requirements, the Contractor will be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt
of the invoice at the designated billing office (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable
agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils). Untimely notification
will be taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph

(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Interest penalty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this
clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal
Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following
business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement
over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed,
the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Computing penalty amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through
the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment
amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing
office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(3)
of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based
on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest
penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance
shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after
the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with a contract provision.
In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest
penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however,
compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make
payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed
7 days (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products,
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the Contractor furnishes correct
electronic funds transfer data; provided, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7
days after the Government receives notice that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause
at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor
over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will
be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes.

Prompt payment discounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated as described in subparagraph
(a)(5) of this clause on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the
discount period through the date when the Contractor is paid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Is owed an interest penalty;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and

of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation,
the demand's validity will be determined by the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
provided, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii)(A) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any original late payment interest penalty that is
due on or after January 22, 1990, except_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the limits stated in subdivision (a)(5)(iii) of this
clause, the amount of the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest penalty that would have
accrued in the absence of these limits, subject to the overall limits on the additional penalty specified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall be the interest penalty due on each
separate payment made for each separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty shall not be based upon
individual invoices unless the invoices are paid separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing purposes,
the maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made separately for each contract therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interest penalty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iii) of this
clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal
Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following
business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement
over quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition, or requested progress payment
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount
was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Computing penalty amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through
the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment
amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing
office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(2)
of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based
on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest
penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance
or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively as shown in subdivisions (a)(4)(i) (A) and (B) of this
clause. In the event that actual acceptance or approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval period,
the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance or approval. Constructive
acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality,
Contractor compliance with a contract provision, or requested progress payment amounts. These requirements also
do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration
functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For work or services completed by the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively
on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For progress payments, Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred on the 7th day after Contractor estimates
have been received by the designated billing office.

provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7 days after the Government receives notice
that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause
at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor
over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable will
be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes.

Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated on the amount
of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when
the Contractor is paid.

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated billing office fails to make the required annotation,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall be the interest penalty due on each

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Progress payments, if provided for elsewhere in this contract, based on Contracting Officer approval of the estimated
amount and value of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The due date for making such payments shall be 14 days after receipt of the payment request by the designated billing
office. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the payment request with the actual date of receipt, at
the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 14th day after the date of the Contractor's payment request, provided
a proper payment request is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance
with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232&hyph;5,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work and presentation of release of all claims against
the Government arising by virtue of the contract, and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the
Government (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated separately in
the contract):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The due date for making such payments shall be either the 30th day after receipt by the designated billing office
of a proper invoice from the Contractor, or the 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed
by the Contractor, whichever is later. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the date
of actual receipt, at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's
invoice, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor
compliance with contract requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

over quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition, or requested progress payment
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Computing penalty amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty
is prescribed by other governmental authority (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, tariffs). This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,'' and it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount
approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through
the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment
amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing
office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(2)
of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based
on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest
penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor for payments described in
subdivision (a)(1)(ii) of this clause, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively
on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the contract. In the event that actual acceptance or approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval
period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance or approval. Constructive
acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality,
or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. These requirements also do not compel Government officials
to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment
prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed
7 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The period between the date of an attempted electronic funds transfer and the date the Contractor furnishes correct
electronic funds transfer data; provided, the Government notifies the Contractor of the defective data within 7
days after the Government receives notice that the transfer could not be completed because of defective data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause
at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor
over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained
in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will
be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233&hyph;1, Disputes.

 An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor,
if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated on the amount of discount
taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when the Contractor
is paid.
