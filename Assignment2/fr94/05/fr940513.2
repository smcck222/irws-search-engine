<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the renewal of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. The
Committee is being renewed in cooperation with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and was recommended
by a 1985 report of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Food Protection, Subcommittee on Microbiological
Criteria, ``An Evaluation of the Role of Microbiological Criteria for Foods.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA is charged with the enforcement of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), the Poultry Products Inspection Act
(PPIA), and the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA). Under these Acts, USDA is responsible for the wholesomeness and
safety of meat, poultry, egg products and products thereof intended for human consumption. Similarly, the Secretary
of HHS is charged with the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Under this Act, HHS is responsible
for ensuring the safety of human foods and animal feeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to continue to meet the responsibilities under the FMIA, PPIA, EPIA, and the FFDCA, the National Advisory
Committee of Microbiological Criteria for Foods is being renewed. The Committee will be tasked with advising and
providing recommendations to the Secretaries on the development of microbiological criteria by which the safety
and wholesomeness of food can be assessed, including criteria for microorganisms that indicate whether foods have
been processed using good manufacturing processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Renewal of this Committee is necessary and in the public interest because the development of a sound public policy
in this area can best be accomplished by a free and open exchange of information and ideas among Federal, State, and
local agencies; the industry; the scientific community; and other interested parties. The complexity of the issues
to be addressed assures that more than one meeting will be required to accomplish the Committee's tasks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Members will be appointed by the Secretary of USDA after consultation with the Secretary of HHS. Because of their interest
in the microbiological criteria for foods, advice on membership appointments will be requested from the Department
of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Department of Defense's U.S. Army Natick Research and Development
Center. Nominations for membership are based primarily on expertise in food science, microbiology, and other relevant
disciplines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Climate and Global Change Program represents a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contribution
to evolving national and international programs designed to improve our ability to observe, understand, predict,
and respond to changes in the global environment. This program builds on NOAA's mission requirements and longstanding
capability in global change research and prediction. The NOAA Program is a key contributing element of the U.S. Global
Change Research Program (USGCRP), which is coordinated by the interagency Committee on Environmental and Natural
Ressources. NOAA's program is designed to complement other agency contributions to that national effort.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Funding Availability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NOAA believes that the Climate and Global Change Program will benefit significantly from a strong partnership with
outside investigators. Current Program plans assume that 30&hyph;35% of the total resources available ($84 million)
anticipated in FY 1995 will support extramural efforts, particularly those involving the broad academic community.
Approximately $20 million will be applied toward extramural grants and cooperative agreements already in progress
and those proposals submitted in FY 1994 that were recommended for funding in FY 1995. Remaining funds, approximately,
$9 million will be available for new grants and cooperative agreements. This Program Announcement is for projects
to be conducted by investigators both inside and outside of NOAA, primarily over a one, two or three year period. Actual
funding levels may be subject to change depending on the final FY 1995 budget appropriation. The funding instrument
will be a grant unless it is anticipated that NOAA will be substantially involved in the implementation of the project
for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument should be a cooperative agreement. Examples of
substantial involvement may include but are not limited to proposals for collaboration between NOAA or NOAA scientists
and a recipient scientist or technician and/or contemplation by NOAA of detailing Federal personnel to work on proposed
projects. NOAA will make decisions regarding the use of a cooperative agreement on a case-by-case basis. Funding
for non-U.S. institutions and contractual arrangements for services and products for delivery to NOAA are not available
under this announcement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The long term objective of the Climate and Global Change Program is to provide reliable predictions of climate change
and associated regional implications on time scales ranging from seasons to a century or more. NOAA believes that
these time scales can be studied with an acceptable probability of success and are the most relevant for fundamental
social concerns. Predicting the behavior of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land surface system will characterize
NOAA's role in a successful national effort to deal with observed or anticipated changes in the global environment.
NOAA has a range of unique facilities and capabilities that can be applied to Climate and Global Change investigations.
Proposals that seek to exploit these resources in collaborative efforts between NOAA and extramural investigators
are encouraged.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1995, NOAA will give priority attention to individual proposals in the areas described below. Investigators
are asked to specify clearly which of these areas is being pursued. The names, affiliations and phone numbers of relevant
Climate and Global Change Program Officers are provided. Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact Program
Officers for further information. Proposals should be sent to the NOAA Office of Global Programs rather than to individual
Program Officers.

Atmospheric Chemistry_The Atmospheric Chemistry Project focuses on global monitoring, process-oriented laboratory
and field studies, and theoretical modeling to improve the predictive understanding of atmospheric trace gases
that influence the Earth's chemical and radiative balance. FY 1995 actions in Atmospheric Chemistry will focus on
studies associated with the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) program of the IGBP. Proposals are
solicited for the following: (i) (highest priority) the North Atlantic Regional Study (NARE), with emphasis on intensive
field studies and modeling; (ii) the International Support Activity: intercalibrations/intercomparisons, with
emphasis on the Nonmethane Hydrocarbon Intercomparison Experiment; (iii) the East Asian/North Pacific Regional
Experiment (APARE), with emphasis on coordination of ground-based chemical measurements and diagnostic analyses
and modeling of regional chemical processes. In addition, proposals are solicited for stratospheric/upper tropospheric
ozone research, with an emphasis on the development or deployment of instruments capable of measuring key chemical
compounds from high-altitude jet aircraft. For an information sheet containing further details, contact: Joel
Levy, NOAA/Global Programs, 301/427&hyph;2089 ext. 756, OMNET: J.Levy, Internet: Levy@ogp.noaa.gov., or Fred

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Climate Observations_A new FY 1995 Climate and Global Change program element is under consideration at this time.
It will focus on ocean, atmosphere and land surface climate observations, measurement systems, and techniques and
is expected to be a blend of former elements including Operational Measurements (OM), Long-Term Ocean Observations
(L&hyph;TOO), Measurement Technique Development, and Solar Variability. Funding for new starts in this element
in FY 1995 will be extremely limited, with no more than one or two new projects anticipated in the OM and L&hyph;TOO areas
and no new projects in Measurement Technique Development or Solar Variability. OM anticipates a tightly focused
program which addresses the development, validation, and implementation of high-quality, climate relevant data
products derived from operational meteorological satellite and in-situ observing systems. Activities in the L&hyph;TOO
focus will continue to be on observations for climate prediction, primarily at seasonal to interannual time scales.
In parallel with ongoing data collection efforts, L&hyph;TOO will support design studies and observing system simulation
experiments aimed at assessing the impact of ocean data on climate prediction. Because of the limited FY 1995 funding
expected, investigators considering submitting a proposal are encouraged to contact program officials for preliminary
discussion of ideas, and are urged to submit letters of intent prior to proposal submission. For further information

Atlantic Climate Change_The goal of this project is to determine the nature and influence of interactions between
the meridional circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, sea surface temperature and salinity, and the global atmosphere.
Proposals are sought in the following areas: (i) Studies using models or historical data to examine variability in
the climate system resulting from interactions between the global atmosphere and the Atlantic Ocean; (ii) modeling
of the maintenance and variability of the relatively warm upper layer water in the Grand Banks region and the sea surface
temperature field of the tropical Atlantic, and what role these regions may play in the larger scale atmospheric and
oceanic climate system; (iii) use of conceptual and numerical models to synthesize near surface data (e.g. surface
drifters, XBTs and sea level) and data from the full water column (e.g. hydrographic, tracer and other data sets);
(iv) documentation of the general characteristics of decadal/century modes of Atlantic climate variability through
synthesis of information from both instrumental and proxy sources. For further information contact: David Goodrich,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tracers and World Ocean Circulation Experiment Hydrography_As part of NOAA's contribution to WOCE, proposals are
sought for tracer observations on WOCE hydrographic cruises. Of particular interest are studies employing transient
tracers operating on decadal to centennial time scales, including chlorofluorocarbons, helium-3/tritium, and
carbon isotopes. WOCE-related proposals will be jointly reviewed by NOAA and the National Science Foundation (NSF)
as part of the interagency WOCE Program Announcement. Proposals for this element should be submitted directly to
the NSF Ocean Sciences Division, using NSF format. For further information contact: David Goodrich, NOAA/Global
Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089 ext. 38, OMNET: D.Goodrich, Internet Goodrich@ogp.noaa.gov.

Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study (OCAES)_As part of NOAA's contribution to the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study
(JGOFS) and as a continuing effort aimed at improving our understanding of the role of the ocean in sequestering the
increasing burden of anthropogenically derived carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, proposals are sought for the planning
NOAA research cruises in the Indian Ocean/Arabian Sea (FY 1995) and along 170
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; West longitude in the South Pacific Ocean (FY 1996). Proposals addressing the measurement of specific chemical
variables including alkalinity, pH, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, primary
productivity and carbon isotopes are encouraged. For an information sheet containing further details, contact:
James F. Todd, NOAA/Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089 ext. 32, OMNET:J.Todd, Internet:

Global Ocean_Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS)_The objectives of the GOALS Program are to understand global climate
variability on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, to determine the extent to which this variability is predictable,
to develop the observational, theoretical, and computational means to predict this variability, and to make experimental
predictions within the limits of proven feasibility. GOALS will broaden the scientific scope of the Tropical Ocean-Global
Atmosphere (TOGA) Program by extending the region of interest to the global climate system, by investigating the
feasibility of predicting regional short-term climate variations throughout the world, and by expanding the observational
and data transmission network as appropriate. GOALS will support research in the areas of monitoring, data management,
empirical studies, modeling and prediction. In this first year, proposals are particularly sought for modeling
and diagnostic studies of the coupled global ocean-atmosphere-land system. A related program, the Pan-American
Climate Studies (PACS) Program, is being formulated to advance seasonal-to-interannual climate prediction over
the Americas and contiguous waters. Proposals for PACS will be solicited under a separate announcement. For further
information contact. Kenneth Mooney, NOAA/Office of Global Programs, Silver Spring MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089

and (iv) to manage long-term C&amp;GC data and information archives. Proposals are sought which are clearly linked
to the specific scientific objectives of the NOAA C&amp;GC Program and which are under the direction of a scientific
principal investigator. Proposals to enhance system and infrastructure responsibilities without firm science
driven objectives will not be considered. Priorities include construction of long-term climate and global change
data sets and information products involving data assembly, digitization, quality control and data rescue, and
support of information management applicable to national and international research programs. For further information

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)_This program element replaces Atmospheric and Land Surface Processes
(ALSP) listed in previous announcements. In FY95, NOAA's principal contribution to GEWEX will be directed at improving
our understanding of physical processes associated with the transfer of heat, moisture and momentum across the land/atmosphere
interface and through the atmospheric boundary layer. Particular emphasis will be placed on issues involving the
scale integration of these processes in climate models. The focus for this activity is the GEWEX Continental-scale
International Project (GCIP) centered on the Mississippi River Basin. Also to be supported within this program element
will be proposals addressing the role of aerosols in forcing climate variability and change, with a focus on the forthcoming
series of Aerosol Characterization Experiments (ACE&hyph;1 &amp; 2). For further information contact: Michael
Coughlan, NOAA/Office of Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089 ext. 40, OMNET: M.Coughlan,

Marine Ecosystem Response_The principal objective of the Marine Ecosystem Response Program is to determine the
relationship between ecosystem dynamics and the climatic variability associated with global change. The majority
of the resources of this program will be devoted to the USGCRP Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (U.S.GLOBEC) program.
A solicitation for proposals, separate from this announcement, will be issued by the jointly supported (NSF/NOAA)
U.S. GLOBEC program, and will be directed at the ongoing U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Study and the planned
California Current study. In addition to U.S. GLOBEC activities, some resources will be devoted to the early detection
of climate change. Under this activity, modest proposals may be sought for the development of coordinated, scientifically
based monitoring of coral reef ecosystems and other innovative pilot projects that might contribute to early detection
of climate change. For further information, contact Mark Eakin, NOAA/Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089

Paleoclimatology_The Paleoclimatology Program solicits proposals that will make significant advances in our
understanding of decade-to-century-scale variability in the climate system. This includes development of new,
high-resolution time series from climatically-sensitive areas presently without adequate data coverage (e.g.,
the tropics and Southern Hemisphere), and datasets that reconstruct large-scale historical patterns of climatic
change that can be used to verify climate and ocean models. FY 1995 proposals may be submitted for either research (both
field and analytical work) or database development. Further details will be published in the next issue of ``The Paleoclimate
Data Record'' published by the World Data Center_A for Paleoclimatology at NOAA/NGDC. For an information sheet or
more information, contact Mark Eakin, NOAA/Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089 ext. 710,

Economics and Human Dimensions of Climate Fluctuations_A new 1995 program element representing the merging of the
Economics and Human Dimensions programs is under consideration at this time. The objective is to promote multidisciplinary
research that increases our understanding of the impacts of climate on human forcing functions of environmental
change. The Program is also intended to provide opportunities for proposals in economics, anthropology, geography,
sociology, and policy sciences to yield insight into this complex relationship. Because funding for new starts may
be limited, a more tightly focussed program will reflect an emphasis, where appropriate, on seasonal to interannual
time scales. For 1995, proposals on the following topics will be considered: (1) Economics research on the value of
scientific and economic information and decision-making frameworks relating to climate fluctuation; (2) historical
and archeological perspectives on climate change; and (3) climate-human interactions, including anthropogenic
activities affecting climate variability/change, as well as social and economic consequences of and adaptation
to climate fluctuation. Within any of the above topics, a focus on coastal issues is welcomed. NOAA's mission includes
human adaptations and vulnerabilities, coastal infrastructure, and governance and management. Interdisciplinary
teams of researchers that include both physical and social scientists are strongly encouraged. Investigators considering
submitting a proposal are strongly encouraged to contact program officials for preliminary discussion of ideas,
and are urged to submit letters of intent prior to proposal submission. For an information sheet containing further
details, contact: Claudia Nierenberg, NOAA/Office of Global Programs, Silver Spring, MD; 301&hyph;427&hyph;2089

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2) and 41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 51&hyph;2.3. Its purpose is to provide interested persons an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to submit comments on the possible impact of the

proposed actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Committee approves the proposed additions, all entities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government (except as otherwise indicated) will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to procure the commodities and services listed below from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the commodities and services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46 - 48c) in connection with the commodities and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 4 and 18, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices
(59 FR 10378 and 12895) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined that the commodities and services listed below are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the commodities and services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby

I. Description of Proposed Rules and Rule Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
By a letter dated May 6, 1994, NYMEX submitted for Commission approval pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (``Act'') proposed rule amendments designed to implement a Plan of Merger (``Plan'') between NYMEX
and COMEX.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Plan, COMEX would remain a separate corporate entity, but would be restructured as a wholly owned subsidiary
of NYMEX (the ``COMEX Division''). Current COMEX memberships would be converted to transferable trading rights
in the COMEX Division of NYMEX which would allow the holders access to COMEX Division markets. The Plan also would provide
for certain cross-access trading rights between members of NYMEX and members of the COMEX Division.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The merger plan as set forth has been approved by the governing boards of both exchanges and by a vote of their memberships.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The COMEX Division would be governed by a Board of Directors selected by NYMEX. The COMEX Board would be advised by a
COMEX Governors Committee on matters pertinent to specifically identified rights and obligations of the COMEX Division
membership. The COMEX Governors Committee would be composed of ten members elected by the COMEX Division membership
and also include three appointed members representing NYMEX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the rules proposed to establish the newly created governance system for the COMEX Division, and to govern
the associated rights and obligations of the COMEX Division membership, the proposed rule changes for the COMEX Division
are substantively the same as existing NYMEX rules, which have previously received Commission approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission requests comments from interested persons concerning any aspect of the proposed merger of COMEX and
NYMEX that commenters believe raises issues under the Act or Commission regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the proposed rules and related materials are available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies also may be obtained through

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity is established under section 1205 of the
Higher Education Act (HEA) as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;325 (20 U.S.C. 1145). The Committee advises the Secretary
of Education with respect to the establishment and enforcement of the standards of accrediting agencies or associations
under subpart 2 of part H of Title IV, HEA, the recognition of a specific accrediting agency or association, the preparation
and publication of the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies and associations, and the functions of
the Secretary under subpart 1 of part H of Title IV, HEA relating to State institutional integrity standards. The Committee
also develops and recommends to the Secretary standards and criteria for specific categories of vocational training
institutions and institutions of higher education for which there are no recognized accrediting agencies, associations,
or State agencies, in order to establish eligibility for such institutions on an interim basis for participation
in federally funded programs.

In accordance with the Federal policy governing the granting of academic degrees by Federal agencies (approved by
a letter from the Director, Bureau of the Budget, to the Secretary, Health, Education, and Welfare, dated December
23, 1954), the Secretary is required to establish a review committee to advise the Secretary concerning any legislation
that may be proposed which would authorize the granting of degrees by a Federal agency. The review committee forwards
its recommendation concerning a Federal agency's proposed degree-granting authority to the Secretary, who then
forwards the committee's recommendation and the Secretary's recommendation to the Office of Management and Budget
for review and transmittal to the Congress. The Secretary uses the Advisory Committee as the review committee required
for this purpose. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee will review the following at this meeting.

The Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, authorize the Secretary to grant recognition
only to those accrediting agencies that either accredit institutions of higher education, provided that accreditation
by those agencies is a required element in enabling those institutions to establish eligibility to participate in
HEA programs, or accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs, provided that accreditation
by those agencies is a required element in enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate
in other programs administered by the Department or by other Federal agencies. Because of the requirements of the
new law, a number of agencies currently recognized by the Secretary are no longer eligible for recognition. At this
meeting, the Advisory Committee will consider the withdrawal of recognition of the following agencies, based upon
the Department staff's determination that they are no longer eligible for recognition by the Secretary because they
do not meet this new requirement:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed grant will provide funding to Harvard to organize and conduct the ``23rd Department of Energy/Nuclear
Regulatory Commission Nuclear Air Cleaning and Treatment Conference,'' to be held from July 25 through 28, 1994,
in Buffalo, New York. It is planned that the conference will be a forum for direct and efficient information transfer,
both within the domestic United States and internationally, among nuclear air cleaning experts, to industry, to
the general public, and to governmental entities. The focus of this information exchange will be currently available
technology and forecasted developments for air and gas cleaning wherever nuclear materials are present. This conference's
proceedings will be incorporated with those of the previous conferences into a cumulatively indexed publication
to aid information retrieval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project is meritorious because of its relevance to the accomplishment of an important public purpose_providing
an international forum for the dissemination of nuclear energy process and safety information related to nuclear
air cleaning and treatment systems in a manner such that the safety of the public will be enhanced by implementation
of operational and design improvements in these systems. The conference is planned to include individual presentations
and panel discussions. Such formats have been proven by the previous events to be very conducive to direct and efficient
information exchange in the state-of-the-art discipline of nuclear air, gas, and water cleaning and treatment.
The conference and its subsequent proceedings may demonstrate once again that research and operating experiences
to be reported from abroad can benefit workers in the United States in areas of research and operations not now conducted
here. Revisions of Federal nuclear standards and regulations pertaining to air and gas cleaning technology are again
expected to receive attention and discussion at the conference. Previous conference proceedings have been cumulatively
indexed and published to aid information retrieval. These data represent the world's largest, most important, and
most accessible information resource on nuclear air and gas cleaning technology. In addition to previously attained
benefits to all sectors of the United States nuclear industry, the planned conference is again expected to expand
the previous successes with prompt introduction of new technology from worldwide sources, candid exchanges of ways
to handle operational difficulties experienced by many installations, stimulation to research in matters of current
regulatory concern, and an international forum for unfettered evaluations of research results, design proposals
for safety improvements, and the practical effects of implementing new regulations and standards. The DOE knows
of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.

Edison Company (``Toledo Edison'') (together, the ``Applicants''), pursuant to section 203 of the Federal Power
Act, 16 U.S.C. section 824b, and part 33 of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission''),
tendered for filing an application for an Order from the Commission authorizing the merger of Toledo Edison into Cleveland
Electric. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants are public utilities organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio, and both Applicants
are engaged in the business of supplying electric energy to wholesale and retail customers within the State of Ohio.
Cleveland Electric generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy to approximately 748,000 customers
in Northern Ohio. Toledo Edison generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy to approximately 285,000
customers in Northwestern Ohio. Cleveland Electric's and Toledo Edison's operations are subject to regulation
by The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Centerior Energy Corporation (``Centerior''), which is organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Ohio, is the 100% owner of the common stock of both Cleveland Electric and Toledo
Edison. Each of Cleveland Electric and Toledo Edison has outstanding serial preferred shares that are held by the
public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms and conditions of a definitive Agreement of Merger entered into by Cleveland Electric and Toledo Edison,
100% of the common shares of Toledo Edison will be converted into newly-issued common shares of Cleveland Electric,
the Toledo Edison preferred shares will be exchanged for newly-issued preferred shares of Cleveland Electric, and
any dissenting preferred shareholders of Toledo Edison will be paid cash for their shares upon exercise of applicable
dissenters' rights. Upon the occurrence of these events, Toledo Edison will be merged into Cleveland Electric and
the separate corporate existence of Toledo Edison will cease. Cleveland Electric will, by operation of law, acquire
title to and interest in all facilities of Toledo Edison that are currently under the jurisdiction of the Commission,
and Cleveland Electric will operate such facilities without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleveland Electric and Toledo Edison believe the proposed corporate reorganization is consistent with the public
interest, and that it will be in the best interests of the customers, shareowners and employees of both Applicants.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Niangua Hydroelectric Project, located on the Niangua River in
Camden County, Missouri near the city of Camdenton, and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (EA) for the
project. In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts
of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
[Docket No. CP94&hyph;389&hyph;000] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on April 28, 1994, Entre Energy Corporation (Entre), 909 Fannin, suite 1095, Houston, Texas 77010,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;389&hyph;000, an application pursuant to sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas
Act (NGA) and subparts A and F of part 157 and subparts G and J of part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under subpart A of part 157, Entre seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The conversion of an existing natural gas producing field to an interstate natural gas storage field; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The construction, installation and operation of the necessary facilities to place the natural gas storage field
into service; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The right to provide firm and interruptible storage services at market-based rates; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Pre-granted abandonment authority for the field and the facilities upon termination of the storage contracts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under subpart F of part 157 and subparts G and J of part 284, respectively, Entre also seeks the following to carry out
its proposal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A Blanket Certificate under sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the NGA for certain interstate natural gas facilities transactions
described in subpart F of part 157; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A Blanket Certificate under sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the NGA for certain interstate natural gas storage and transportation
activities described in subpart G of part 284; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A Blanket Certificate under sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the NGA, as described in subpart J of part 284, to sell about
7.5 Bcf of natural gas that Entre plans to inject to test the storage reservoir. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entre states that it is a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entre Holdings Company, an independent
producer of natural gas. Entre states that its propose is to develop, construct and operate the first underground
natural gas storage facility to be located entirely offshore. The proposed storage reservoir is located in the Chandeleur
Area, Block 29 field, of the Federal OCS_Offshore Louisiana. The proposed interstate storage facility would be connected
to the interstate pipeline facilities of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern). Specifically,
Entre proposes to connect into Texas Eastern's 24-inch pipeline in the Main Pass Area, Block 92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entre filed a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tariff which contains rate schedules for firm storage service, interruptible storage service, a sales service and
general terms and conditions. Entre states that the storage services will be provided on an open access basis and will
confirm to Order No. 636, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Entre further states that it will hold an open season for the storage capacity which is proposed to begin on July 1, 1994
and continue for 45 days. In addition, Entre proposes to make sales of approximately 7.5 Bcf of gas that it anticipates
injecting into the storage reservoir during the testing phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entre states that it is currently planning to operate this proposed storage facility with a total working gas capacity
of 25.6 Bcf. Entre says that the storage field will be designed to provide first day withdrawal service of 300,000 Mcf
per day and 193,000 Mcf per day withdrawal service at the end of the expected 105-day withdrawal period. Entre further
says that if enough interest is generated during its open season, it will seek authorization from the Commission to
increase the size of the storage project to 41 Bcf of working gas capacity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Entre states that facilities associated with the proposed 25.6 Bcf storage project will consist of a 6.5-mile, 16-inch
diameter pipeline connected to Texas Eastern, 7 injection/withdrawal wells, compression of about 12,000 horsepower
and appurtenant facilities. Entre says that if it elects to pursue the 41 Bcf storage project, it will propose to increase
the size of 16-inch diameter pipeline to 24 inches and will increase total compression to 21,400 horsepower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entre has proposed market-based rates for all of its services. Entre maintains that it lacks market power for the proposed
storage services and that granting it the authority to utilize market-based rates would be consistent with Commission
action in other cases. However, Entre does propose to retain 2.2 percent of injected volumes as a fuel reimbursement.
Entre also proposes to add the Annual Charge Adjustment to the negotiated base rate of its various proposed charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entre says that the construction of storage-related facilities is scheduled to commence later in 1994. Therefore,
Entre requests that the Commission expedite the processing of this application and grant the requested authorization
by July 29, 1994, to permit the commencement of service during the 1994&hyph;1995 heating season.

[Docket No. CP94&hyph;459&hyph;000]

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on May 2, 1994, Appalachian Gas Sales, Inc. (AGS), 333 N. Fairfax Street, Suite 300, Alexandria, Va.
22314, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;459&hyph;000 a complaint pursuant to Rule 206 of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure against Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf). AGS states
that Columbia Gulf has unduly discriminated against them by erroneously allocating their gas to a third party, Centran
Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy on 1/2/93. In addition, AGS claims that Columbia Gulf's refusal to remedy
the misallocation creates an undue preference in their favor, all as more fully set forth in the complaint which is
on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interruptible transportation service that Columbia Gulf performs for AGS is provided under Columbia Gulf's
blanket certificate pursuant to part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. AGS states that the Commission, pursuant
to its authority under Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), should direct Columbia Gulf to remedy the discrimination
prejudice, and preference against AGS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically AGS claims that Columbia Gulf's arbitrary allocation of gas on a pro rata basis between two shippers
at a receipt point was not authorized in its tariff. AGS states that Columbia Gulf refused to accept a good faith reallocation
request, tendered outside the time period provided under section 6(b)(3) of Rate Schedule ITS&hyph;1, while granting
out-of-time reallocation requests for other shippers. AGS requests that the Commission order Columbia Gulf to reallocate
all volumes of gas delivered for AGS's account during October 1992. AGS claims that Columbia Gulf has provided itself
with a preference at AGS's expense by arbitrarily allocating AGS's gas to a third party in order to reduce its exposure
as an unsecured creditor in the Centran Corporation bankruptcy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on May 4, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway), P.O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1478,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;525&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to seek certificate authority
for facilities previously constructed under section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act and &sect;284.3(c) of the
Commission's Regulations under Koch Gateway's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;430&hyph;000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koch Gateway states that the proposed certification of facilities will enable Koch Gateway to provide transportation
services under its blanket transportation certificate through two six-inch taps and meter station constructed
in Harrison County, Texas. Koch Gateway also states that it will operate the proposed facilities in compliance with
18 C.F.R., Part 157, Subpart F, and that it has sufficient capacity to render the proposed service without detriment
or disadvantage to its other existing customers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's Acid Rain Program was established by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) to reduce acid rain
in the continental United States. The Acid Rain Program will achieve a 50 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions from utility units. The SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction program is a flexible market-based approach to environmental management. As part of this approach, EPA
allocates ``allowances'' to affected utility units. Each allowance is a limited authorization to emit up to one ton
of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. At the end of each calendar year, each unit must hold allowances in an amount equal to or greater than its SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions for the year. Allowances may be bought, sold, or transferred between utilities and other interested parties.
Those utility units whose annual emissions are likely to exceed their allocation of allowances may either install
pollution control technologies or switch to cleaner fuels to reduce SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, or buy additional allowances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements potentially affect any device that combusts fossil fuel and supplies electricity for sale or serves
an electrical generating device that supplies electricity for sale. Thus, units owned or operated by industrial
or commercial entities may be affected. To ensure adequate notice to all potentially affected units, EPA has chosen
to provide this notice of availability of the Acid Rain applicability guidance.

Summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expressed environmental concerns about adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts which may occur on the Forest Service land to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given to the Plum Creek Timber Company (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wildlife habitat, old growth, visual, fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts). EPA also expressed concerns about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty of future activities (i.e., subdivision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development, oil and gas leasing, and mining) on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchanged parcels. EPA recommended that the Forest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service require a conservation easement prohibiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future subdivision development on the Forest Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land to be given to Plum Creek Timber Company.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that M.A. Norden Company has petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for reconsideration
of the total site prohibition identified in EPA's June 15, 1984, Final Determination concerning the Norden site in
Mobile, Alabama pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). M.A. Norden has requested this amendment
as a prerequisite to seeking CWA authorization to discharge dredged or fill material into wetlands to construct a
road across the restricted section 404(c) area in order to provide access to an adjacent parcel of upland property.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is requesting comments on M.A. Norden's proposal for reconsideration of the Final Determination's total site
prohibition. In particular, EPA is interested in determining whether discharges associated with the proposed road
construction will result in unacceptable adverse effects under section 404(c).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to restrict or prohibit the use of an area as a disposal site for
dredged or fill material if the discharge will have unacceptable adverse effects on municipal water supplies, shellfish
beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas. Prior to making
such a determination, the Administrator of EPA consults with the Chief of Engineers and the applicant/landowner.
In the case of the Norden Company site, such consultations did not resolve EPA's concerns over the originally planned
use of the site and on June 15, 1984, EPA issued a Final Determination prohibiting the discharge of dredged or fill materials
into the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Determination described the then proposed project, the ecological values associated with the site, project
alternatives, and the efforts made to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. Based on the record it had compiled,
EPA determined that ``the discharge of the fill materials into the site proposed by the M.A. Norden Company (`the Norden
site') would have an unacceptable adverse effect on shellfish beds and fishery areas and wildlife areas'' and prohibited
the use of the area for specification as a disposal site. This prohibition prevented the future disposal of any dredged
or fill material at the entire 25 acre site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 5, 1992, M.A. Norden Company (Norden Company) formally applied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) for reconsideration of the June 15, 1984 Final Determination for the Norden Company site in Mobile, Alabama
pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to accommodate a scaled down proposal. Additional information supporting
this request was received by EPA on August 5, 1993. EPA made visits to the Norden Company site in February 1992 and September
1993. As more fully described below, Norden Company has proposed to discharge 9,300 cubic yards of dredged or fill
material into approximately 1.5 acres of wetlands on the section 404(c) restricted site in order to construct a roadway
to provide access to an adjacent upland site. This new proposal would reduce the direct impacts of the original proposal
from 25 acres of wetlands filled to approximately 1.5 acres filled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The June 15, 1984 Norden Final Determination restricts the use of the entire 25 acre Norden Company site for any discharges
of dredged or fill material. Therefore, implementing this new proposal would require that EPA amend the 1984 Final
Determination. If EPA, upon consideration of the original administrative record, the new proposal, supporting
documentation, and any public comments, determines that such amendment is appropriate, a section 404 permit issued
by the Corps of Engineers would still be necessary before discharges associated with the access road could proceed.
Norden Company would have to follow the standard permitting process for that approval. That process provides an additional
opportunity for public notice and comment.

Proposed Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Norden Company has submitted a detailed description of the proposed project. The project description below is based
on these Norden Company submissions and may be further revised in the section 404 permit application review process.
The proposal is to extend an existing abandoned railway spur across the site as a vehicular roadway for use by heavy
truck (container) traffic from the Port of Mobile facilities to a storage area on the upland. The existing railway
spur is 30 feet wide and 900 feet long. It would be widened and extended, at a slight angle, approximately 600 feet across
the wetlands and drainage canal to reach an upland area. Approximately 9,300 cubic yards of sand material on geotechtile
fabric will be placed in the wetlands for roadbed fill. The typical road section will be 36 feet wide at the top and 60
feet wide at the base with 3:1 side slopes. Silt screens will be erected and the side slopes will be seeded and mulched
to prevent erosion and sedimentation of the adjacent waters and wetlands. Four concrete culverts (three 24 inch diameter
culverts and one 36 inch diameter culvert) will be placed through the fill, underneath the roadway to allow for exchange
of water between the divided portions of the wetland. A box culvert will be placed in the existing drainage canal to
allow for unobstructed flow. Mitigation for project impacts is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the form of providing culverting where none previously existed through the railway spur to allow for better
water circulation. Norden Company anticipates that the work would be completed in six months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on the current proposal by the Norden Company. Specifically, comments should address
whether this proposal would have lesser impacts on the aquatic environment than the project which was originally
proposed. In addition, EPA is interested in determining whether there are less environmentally damaging practicable
alternatives to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem while fulfilling
the basic project purpose.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the ``Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986'', under which the Environmental Protection
Agency is directed to conduct research and disseminate information on all aspects of indoor air quality, this notice
announces that the report described below is available for public review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment
requested that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency analyze (quantitatively where possible) the compliance
costs and the health and economic benefits of H.R. 3434. Specifically, the Agency was requested to assess the cost
of compliance including provisions for smoking lounges; the value of benefits resulting from reduced exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke and changes in smoking behavior including the value of lives saved; the value of increased
productivity and reduced absenteeism; savings from reduced operation and maintenance costs; and savings in fire
related injuries and property damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993 (H.R. 3434) would require that all residential buildings regularly entered
by ten or more persons in the course of a week that bans smoking inside the building or restricts smoking to separately
ventilated smoking rooms. The proposed legislation provides for enforcement actions in the United States District
Courts by an individual, government or other aggrieved entity and allows for fines of up to $5,000 per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report presents EPA's analysis and findings of the costs and benefits of implementing national legislation that
would establish policies that would prohibit smoking indoors in specified buildings and/or provide for separately
ventilated smoking lounges.

Notice of Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 10, 1994, notice was published that the State of Massachusetts had petitioned the Regional Administrator,
Environmental Protection Agency, to determine that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment
of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for the coastal waters of Waquoit Bay, that border the Towns of
Falmouth and Mashpee, within the State of Massachusetts (56 FR 57891). The petition was filed pursuant to section
312(f)(3) of Pub. L. 92&hyph;500 as amended by Pub. L. 95&hyph;217 and Pub. L. 100&hyph;4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 312(f)(3) states:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After the effective date of the initial standards and regulations promulgated under this section, if any State determines
that the protection and enhancement of the quality of some or all of the waters within such States require greater environmental
protection, such State may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not,
into such waters, except that no such prohibition shall apply until the Administrator determines that adequate facilities
for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for such water
to which such prohibition would apply.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information submitted to me by the State of Massachusetts certified that there are two pump-out facilities available
to service vessels in Waquoit Bay that border the coastal waters of Falmouth and Mashpee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pump-out facility No. 1 is located at the Edwards Boat Yard, on the Childs River in Falmouth. This facility will provide
stationary pump-out service and will be available seven days a week from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Memorial Day through
Columbus Day. During the rest of the year, the pumpout facility will operate Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until
4:30 p.m., and half days on Saturdays several weeks before Memorial Day and after Columbus Day. There will be a $5.00
fee per pump-out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pump-out facility No. 2 is located at the Little River Boat Yard, on Seconsett Island in Mashpee. This facility will
provide stationary/mobile pump-out service seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Memorial Day through Columbus Day.
Business hours at other times of the year will be Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. During the summer season,
the mobile service will make a scheduled round of Waquoit Bay to provide service to moored boats throughout the bay,
including transient boats located along the shores of Washburn Island. Mariners will be able to contact the operator
by marine radio (Channel 09 VHF&hyph;FM) or visible signal to request a pump-out. The remainder of the time, the facility
will be docked so that pump-out service will be available for any boats wishing to use it. There will be a $5.00 fee per
pump-out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All pump-out waste will be stored in a 2000 gallon licensed tight tank at the Edward's Boat Yard. A licensed hauler will
remove the waste and dispose of it in the Falmouth Sewage Treatment Plant which is approved by the Massachusetts Department
of Environmental Protection to receive boat waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marinas are found along the Childs and Little River and docks line the bay's tributaries and salt ponds. Currently,
there are an estimated 2610 boats in Waquoit Bay and its tributaries and salt ponds with approximately 570 boats having
some type of Marine Sanitation Device (MSD) based on their size classification. Waquoit Bay is 931 acres in size with
a watershed of approximately 20 square miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments received by the Agency on the merits of the petition prior to the deadline for receipt of comments
as stated in the March 10, 1994

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on an examination of the petition, and its supporting information which included a site visit by EPA Region I
staff, and the fact that the Agency received no comments concerning the petition, I have determined that adequate
facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for
Waquoit Bay and its tributaries and salt ponds that border the Towns of Falmouth and Mashpee, within the State of Massachusetts,
to qualify as a ``No Discharge Area''.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As part of its payments system risk reduction program, the Board is adopting an interpretation of its Policy Statement
on Payments System Risk. Under the payments system risk reduction program, government-sponsored enterprises that
maintain accounts at Reserve Banks should not incur daylight overdrafts in these accounts and are not permitted to
adopt a positive daylight overdraft net debit cap. Furthermore, the Board interprets the Policy Statement on Payments
System Risk to include government-sponsored enterprises under the policy on daylight overdraft fees. Until October
13, 1994, fees on daylight overdrafts in accounts of government-sponsored enterprises will be waived. A temporary
exemption from daylight overdraft fees is granted for daylight overdrafts in principal and interest accounts of
government-sponsored enterprises. This interpretation supports the Board's payments system risk reduction program
by providing a comprehensive policy towards daylight overdrafts incurred by government-sponsored enterprises
while at the same time recognizing the unique nature of the fiscal agency relationship between the Federal Reserve
and these entities.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``government-sponsored enterprise'' (GSE) is generally used to refer to corporations chartered by Congress
to perform certain financial market functions deemed to be in the public interest. These entities include, but are
not limited to, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac), the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), and entities of the Federal Home Loan Bank System
and the Farm Credit System. These GSEs are owned by private shareholders and their obligations are not guaranteed
by the U.S. government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress authorized the Reserve Banks to act as depositaries, custodians, and fiscal agents for these entities.
Under agreements with the GSEs, the Reserve Banks issue and redeem the GSEs' debt and asset-backed securities over
the Fedwire system, in addition to providing other payment services generally related to these fiscal agency services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's payments system risk (PSR) policies and guidelines have addressed daylight overdrafts by government-sponsored
enterprises that maintain accounts with Federal Reserve Banks only in certain limited instances. In 1985, the Board
determined that Federal Home Loan Banks should not be allowed a positive net debit cap and should be discouraged from
incurring daylight overdrafts in their accounts with the Reserve Banks. In June 1986, the Board similarly determined
that the Farm Credit System Banks should be discouraged from incurring overdrafts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has never addressed daylight overdrafts of other GSEs, including those for which the Reserve Banks act as
fiscal agents in issuing and redeeming their securities. Further, when the Board approved in 1992 the policy of charging
fees for daylight overdrafts beginning in April 1994, it did not address the question of whether GSEs would be subject
to the fees. However, the policy did not exclude GSEs or any other class of account-holders from the fees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, in 1994, the Board adopted a penalty fee for daylight overdraft incurred by institutions that do not have
regular discount window access, although GSEs were not included in this penalty fee policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Reserve is not obligated to provide intraday credit to the GSEs in the form of daylight overdrafts as part
of its fiscal agency functions; indeed, the GSEs have generally agreed not to incur overdrafts in their accounts.
However, many of the GSEs have nonetheless incurred daylight overdrafts. The Board believes that, with the advent
of daylight overdraft fees for depository institutions on April 14, 1994, it is particularly important that the GSEs
not be permitted unlimited free access to intraday Federal Reserve credit. Such access would represent a benefit
not available to depository institutions and could serve to undermine the Board's payment system risk reduction
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Board interprets the Policy Statement on Payments System Risk to include GSEs under the policy on daylight
overdraft fees. In addition, the Board has determined that a capital-based fee deductible, as permitted for depository
institutions, will not be permitted for the GSEs. These entities do not have regular access to the discount window
and should not be permitted the same access to intraday credit as depository institutions. However, because a number
of these entities have not been formally subject to the PSR policy in the past and have not previously been explicitly
advised that daylight overdraft fees would apply to their accounts, the Board has determined that they should be afforded
some period within which to make the necessary adjustments to their payment systems and practices. As a result, daylight
overdraft fees for daylight overdrafts in GSEs' accounts will be waived until October 13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Board recognizes that, in large part, the GSEs' daylight overdrafts are related to regular payments
of principal and interest (P&amp;I) on securities that they issue through the Federal Reserve. These payments are
initiated by the Reserve Banks, and the Federal Reserve's daylight overdraft posting rules specify that these payments
will be made before 9:15 a.m. Eastern time. These posting times were primarily designed to grant depository institutions
the benefit of P&amp;I payments prior to debits being made to their accounts from their purchases of new issues of government
securities. The GSEs typically do not fund debits to their accounts resulting from P&amp;I payments until they issue
new securities later in the day, causing daylight overdrafts in their Federal Reserve accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To eliminate these daylight overdrafts, the Reserve Banks could delay making P&amp;I payments on the GSEs' securities
until sufficient funds were available in their accounts. This would likely require that the P&amp;I payments be made
later in the day. Delaying the P&amp;I payments might increase the magnitude and duration of daylight overdrafts
for the depository institutions that receive the corresponding credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, the Board is permitting a temporary exemption of overdrafts incurred in GSEs' P&amp;I accounts (special
accounts which are used only for the payment of principal and interest), until the potential benefits and drawbacks
of shifting the timing of P&amp;I payments can be analyzed. This analysis will be performed once the initial impact
of daylight overdraft fees on depository institutions has been assessed. In addition, the Board has not ruled out
future application of the daylight overdraft penalty fee to GSEs' daylight overdrafts.

Interpretation of the Policy Statement on Payments System Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Board's payments system risk reduction program, government-sponsored enterprises that maintain accounts
at Reserve Banks should not incur daylight overdrafts in these accounts and are not permitted to adopt a positive daylight
overdraft net debit cap. Furthermore, the Board interprets the Policy Statement on Payments System Risk to include
government-sponsored enterprises under the policy on daylight overdraft fees. A capital-based fee deductible
is not permitted for government-sponsored enterprises. However, a temporary exemption from daylight overdraft
fees is granted for daylight overdrafts in principal and interest accounts of government-sponsored enterprises.
Fees on daylight overdrafts in accounts of government-sponsored enterprises will be waived until October 13, 1994.

Changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a Federal department or agency considers that these standards do not provide for its essential needs, a statement
citing inadequacies shall be sent in duplicate to the General Services Administration, Regulations Analysis Division
(KMR), Washington, DC 20405, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Information Resources Management
Regulation, Subpart 201&hyph;20.3. The General Services Administration will determine the appropriate action
to be taken and will notify the agency. Federal departments and agencies are encouraged to submit updates and corrections
to these standards, which will be considered for the next revision of this standard. The General Services Administration
has delegated the compilation of suggested changes to the National Communications System whose address is given

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, life expectancy at birth for Americans in 1991 rose to a record
75.5 years. The Census Bureau predicts that by the year 2020 the average life expectancy will be 82 years for women and
74.2 years for men. At the turn of the century, only 4 percent of the American population was 65 and over. By 1990, it was
12 percent. Beginning in approximately 15 years, the percentage is projected to increase rapidly to 20 percent and
then to increase slowly to about 21% by 2050 and 22% by 2060. By the year 2030, there will be more people age 65 and older
than young people under age 15 in the population.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The baby boom generation, which will begin to reach retirement age in little more than a decade, now represents the
largest age segment of the U.S. population, numbering approximately 75 million. The current older population, already
noted for its heterogeneity, will be significantly more diverse with the aging of the baby boomers in the early decades
of the 21st century. The great increase in the numbers and the diversity of the elderly, combined with dramatically
different lifestyle changes, such as four-generation households and more women serving in both caregiving roles
and the work force, are all important factors to consider in planning for an aging society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Nation is to be well prepared for the burgeoning numbers of older persons at the turn of the century, and to be equally
well equipped to take advantage of the opportunities those changes provide_and not be daunted by the hard challenges_then
today we must grasp the basic implications of an aging society, and act on the basis of those realizations. Our Nation
has many different policies and agencies that impact on what people may or may not do when they retire. Although the
Department of Health and Human Services provides the bulk of public financing for programs and benefits that directly
or indirectly affect older persons, almost every federal agency is involved in providing services to older persons
including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Justice, Agriculture, Labor, Defense,
Energy and Treasury. By creating the position of Assistant Secretary for Aging, the President and the Secretary of
the Department Health and Human Services have provided a focal point for aging policy, whereby the disparate program
responsibilities of federal government agencies can be linked into a more coherent vision of what is needed for an
aging society.

B. Older Americans Act Responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, is designed to provide assistance in the development of new or improved
programs to help older persons, through grants to the States and tribal organizations for community planning and
services and for research, demonstration and training projects. Through the Act, the Congress has declared that
it is the responsibility of the Federal government, the States and Native American tribal organizations to assist
older people as they endeavor to secure an adequate retirement income, the best possible physical or mental health
services, suitable housing, long term care services, employment opportunities and participation in a wide range
of civic, cultural, eduational and recreational activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II of the Act declares, further, that it is the responsibility of the Assistant Secretary for Aging to serve as
the effective and visible advocate for older individuals within the Department of Health and Human Services and with
other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government. Under Title II, the Assistant Secretary
is charged with directly assisting the Secretary of Health and Human Services in all matters pertaining to problems
of the aged and aging and with the responsibility to administer the formula and discretionary grant programs authorized
by Congress under Titles III, IV, VI and VII of the Act.

1. The AoA Discretionary Funds Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Discretionary Funds Program authorized by Title IV of the Act constitutes the major research, demonstration,
training and development effort of the Administration on Aging. Through this Title IV Program Announcement, the
Assistant Secretary for Aging intends to draw special attention to the Discretionary Funds Program as an essential
mechanism for: (a) improving programs and services to the elderly: (b) emphasizing several major initiatives that
respond directly to the current and future challenges and opportunities of an aging society, and; (c) carrying out
his responsibilities as a chief advocate for older persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Title IV mandate is aimed, generally, at building knowledge, developing innovative model programs, and training
personnel for service in the field of aging, and matching these resources to the changing needs of older persons and
their families in the coming decades. AoA's research, demonstrations, training and other discretionary projects
are focused on:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
2. Coordination With Other Federal Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with Title II of the Older Americans Act, the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on
Aging (AoA) function as focal points within the Federal government for aging-related concerns. In that capacity,
the Assistant Secretary advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services on matters affecting older Americans
and provides consultation and information to units across the Federal government on the characteristics, circumstances,
and needs of older persons. AoA has a strong commitment to working with other Federal agencies on policy and program
development in issue areas of importance to older Americans. To carry out its national level program and advocacy
responsibilities, AoA places major emphasis on developing collaborative relationships with other Federal agencies
aimed at coordinating diverse and wide-ranging Federal program resources and linking those resources to the similarly
diverse needs of older persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dating back two decades, AoA has worked hard to develop and implement a network of Federal Interagency Agreements
to better serve older Americans, combining our resources with those of the Departments of Transportation, Housing
and Urban Development, Labor, and Education, the Farmers Home Administration, and the Corporation for National
and Community Service (formerly ACTION), as well as with other agencies within the Department of Health and Human
Services, such as the Social Security Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration, the Administration
for Children and Families, and the Public Health Service, including the National Institute on Aging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These interagency collaborations represent a strategic coupling of AoA's resources to serve the nation's elderly,
especially those at risk of losing their independence. AoA's Federal Interagency Agreements cover a spectrum of
program efforts_in housing, transportation, health promotion, elder abuse, etc._that closely parallel a number
of the priority areas in this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
3. Dissemination of Title IV Project Results and Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In keeping with the provisions of the Older Americans Act, all projects funded under Title IV are required to undertake
vigorous steps to disseminate the results and products of their projects to appropriate audiences involved in promoting
the well-being of older persons. This should include energetic marketing of products and results. Projects are strongly
encouraged to utilize appropriate promotional media campaigns in order to insure that their outcomes receive the
widest possible attention. Such campaigns should seek to educate consumers, providers (including the Aging Network),
the private sector, and policy sector about their results and to promote use of their products. A special priority
area in this Program Announcement further emphasizes the importance of dissemination and utilization of Title IV
project findings, products, and results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described below in Part III, Section I.2, the most effective dissemination begins at the moment a project is conceptualized
and includes the involvement of potential user audiences throughout the project, particularly in the design of products.
As part of their dissemination plan, applicants are also encouraged to consider the development, as appropriate,
of brief products suitable for widespread dissemination to older persons, their families and other caregivers,
and practitioners who serve older persons. Advice on ways to maximize the utilization of a proposed project may be
obtained by contacting Saadia Greenberg at the AoA Office of Dissemination and Utilization at (202) 619&hyph;0441.
Applicants may also be interested in obtaining a publication entitled,

C. Major Strategic Initiatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Health and Human Services has charged the Assistant Secretary for Aging with lead responsibility
within the Department for four major strategic initiatives_home and community-based long-term care; older women;
an aging blueprint for future generations; and nutrition and malnutrition. These initiatives are in concert with
the Older Americans Act mandate to develop new and improved programs to help older persons. Through this Program Announcement,
the Assistant Secretary is focusing Title IV Discretionary Funds support on each of these initiatives. (Full descriptions
of the initiatives are available by contacting the Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging at 202&hyph;619&hyph;0441).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Home and Community Based Long Term Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The home and community-based long-term care initiative responds to the central concern that persons with chronic
illnesses and disabilities have the resources to live independently in their homes and communities as long as possible.
One critical issue now being debated is how we can best ensure that government at all levels works in a more efficient
and effective manner to help meet that concern. To focus attention on this and other key issues affecting home and community-based
long-term care, the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging convened a Health Care University
in January 1994. The Health Care University provided a forum for (1) outlining the Assistant Secretary's home and
community-based long-term care initiative; (2) encouraging the participants (including community, state, Tribal,
and national organizations, agencies, and officials) to better understand and fully discuss the Health Security
Act legislation proposed by the President, and; (3) providing preliminary findings of the AoA home and community-based
long-term care survey.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The home and community-based long term care initiative will focus on building a comprehensive policy on long-term
care for all persons who need services, with a special emphasis on the elderly. Surveys show that older people overwhelmingly
prefer to live in their own homes and communities, rather than in institutional settings, but many need home and community-based
services to do so. Approximately 6.1 million older people living in the community experience difficulty with one
or more activities of daily living such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, or transferring in or out of bed.
However, less than half of these individuals receive any personal help. Through this Discretionary Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program (DFP) Announcement, AoA will provide leadership for the continued development of consumer-driven home
and community-based systems of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Older Women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Efforts to improve the quality of life for America's older women comprise another of the Assistant Secretary's initiatives
upon which this DFP Announcement will focus. Women comprise 60 percent of today's 65 plus population. Today, there
are 18.3 million women, as compared to 12.6 older men. By the year 2000, it is expected that there will be five women for
every two men over the age of 75. The special circumstances faced by older women are frequently overlooked. Almost
three-quarters of all elderly persons living below poverty are women. Poverty is projected to be an even greater problem
for women when the baby boom generation reaches retirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although women live longer than men, the quality of their lives often deteriorates substantially in the later years
due to illnesses, chronic conditions, falls and other injuries, and stresses of caregiving or of living alone. Some
physical conditions which typically affect older women can be prevented if they are encouraged to adopt healthier
lifestyles in the late middle years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration on Aging recognizes the need for a highly visible, well-coordinated effort which, through outreach,
education, dissemination, advocacy and partnership-building, will focus on critical issues affecting older women
including income security, health, caregiving and housing. The older women's initiative will work to enhance the
capacity of the Aging Network to effectively address older women's issues and explore the feasibility of developing
intradepartmental and interagency partnerships to address the needs of older women. It will also endeavor to educate
older women at the grass roots/local level, as well as the public and private sectors, about issues affecting older
women; and reinforce the capacity of women to make significant contributions to society throughout the life cycle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Nutrition and Malnutrition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nutrition and malnutrition initiative of the Assistant Secretary will address the critical problem of malnutrition
among the elderly. Recent surveys show that alarming numbers of older Americans are malnourished. At the same time,
because of medical advances and the availability of community-based services, such as home delivered meals, more
older persons have been able to remain independent and in their own homes, rather than having to be institutionalized.
The Administration on Aging's nutrition and malnutrition initiative will focus attention on educating the public
and private sectors to the growing problem of malnutrition, and finding ways to prevent its occurrence. As part of
that effort, AoA is now supporting a synthesis of current knowledge concerning the nutritional status of older persons,
as well as an analysis of public awareness of the issues of nutrition and malnutrition among the elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration on Aging will also focus its nutrition and malnutrition initiative on the current in-home and
congregate meals programs supported under Title III and Title VI of the Older Americans Act. Key goals are: 1) increasing
public awareness regarding the issues of adequate nutrition, malnutrition, hunger, and food insecurity and their
interrelationships to health, independence, and quality of life of older individuals; 2) providing leadership
in promoting a nutrition agenda for the future; 3) developing and promoting direct prevention and intervention strategies
to enhance the nutritional status of older people, and; 4) developing integrated public policies to ensure greater
access to appropriate food and nutrition services for older individuals. In support of these essential components
of the nutrition and malnutrition initiative, the Assistant Secretary for Aging is investing approximately $2.8
million dollars in an evaluation of the National Nutrition Program for the Elderly funded under Title III of the Older
Americans Act. A contract to perform the evaluation has been awarded to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., of Princeton,
N.J.

4. Blueprint for an Aging Society 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another major AoA initiative that the Program Announcement will address is development of a blueprint for how the
Nation can and should now prepare for the retirement of future generations, particularly the baby-boom generation.
As society ages, and the first of the baby boom generation reaches retirement age in the next decade, we must begin to
plan for the impact that this aging cohort, and those following, will have on our society. Significant increases in
the numbers and diversity of older persons, the complexity of claims on resources being made between generations,
dramatically different lifestyle changes such as four generation households and more women serving in both caregiving
roles and the work force_these are among the critical factors that must be addressed in planning for an aging society.
In addition, society must learn to recognize that active and productive retirement is the norm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining how best to address the needs of our aging society, we must examine not only the economic implications,
but the social implications as well. The Blueprint will outline a framework for responding to the issues of future
retirees by examining the aging of the baby boom cohort from a wide perspective, including issues such as the role of
health and long-term care; the importance of supportive services such as housing and transportation; lifestyle
choices and individual responsibility; the impact of demographic changes on family and social structures; diversity
issues; and the economic realities of an aging society. This conceptual framework will assist the federal government
in sorting out the options available to promote a more coordinated approach to our aging society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing the aging of society from this broad framework necessitates that we explore ways of working both within
and outside of the Department of Health and Human Services to address these critical issues. The role of the Administration
on Aging would include mounting an education campaign around savings and thrift issues, as well as physical fitness
and health promotion. This education campaign would have as its focus making society aware of the opportunities and
choices available to older persons to remain productive and active citizens, as well as the contributions seniors
make to this country.

D. Other Older Americans Act Mandates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other areas of emphasis in this Title IV Discretionary Funds Program Announcement derive from certain specific mandates
of the Older Americans Act, which concentrate discretionary funding resources on making specific aging programs
more effective and on better serving vulnerable population groups. The priority program areas (in addition to long
term care, nutrition, older women, and a future aging society) include multigenerational and intergenerational
programs, volunteerism, and minority aging.

AoA invites comments on this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. In addition, because the field of aging is
characterized by rapidly unfolding events, new data, findings and interpretations, and a diversity of issues important
to older people, the Administration on Aging is considering the publication of two Discretionary Funds Program Announcements
in Fiscal Year 1995, in early Winter and late Spring. We invite comments on that possibility as well. Please direct
your comments to: Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging, 330 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part II of the Discretionary Funds Program (DFP) Announcement sets forth the priority areas under which applications
will be considered for funding by the Administration on Aging. Part II also provides general guidelines concerning
eligible applicants as well as project costs and duration. More specific instructions regarding eligibility, the
federal share of project costs, project duration, and deadline dates for the submission of applications may be found
under the individual priority areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications must be directly and explicitly responsive to the expressed concerns of the particular priority area
under which they are submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general rule, any public or nonprofit agency, organization, or institution is eligible to apply under this Discretionary
Funds Program Announcement. Where there are exceptions to this rule, they are specified in the appropriate priority
area description. The Administration on Aging will not consider grant applications from individuals because they
are ineligible to receive a grant award under the provisions of Title IV of the Older Americans Act. For-profit organizations
are not eligible applicants, but may participate as subgrantees or subcontractors to eligible public or nonprofit
agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any nonprofit organization applying under this program announcement that is not now a DHHS grantee should include,
with its application, Internal Revenue Service or other legally recognized documentation of its nonprofit status.
A nonprofit applicant cannot be funded without proof of its status.

B. Project Costs and Duration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under each priority area, AoA has estimated the number of projects to be funded and offered guidelines regarding both
the duration of those projects and the anticipated federal share of project costs. Because applications are reviewed
on a competitive basis within priority areas, they are expected to be comparable in terms of cost and duration. Therefore,
applicants are strongly urged to adhere to those guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Projects Funded Under Cooperative Agreement Awards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under certain priority areas, AoA has indicated it will use the mechanism of the cooperative agreement in making awards.
Under the cooperative agreement mechanism, AoA and each project grantee will share responsibility for managing
that project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee organization will have the primary responsibility for developing and implementing the activities of
the project. AoA will join with the grantee in deciding the major issues to be addressed by the project; use periodic
briefings and ongoing consultation to share with the grantee its knowledge of the issues being addressed by the project
as well as information about relevant activities being undertaken by others; provide feedback to the grantee about
the usefulness to the field of its written products and information sharing activities; and participate as much as
possible in the deliberations of the project advisory committee. The details of this relationship will be set forth
in the cooperative agreement to be developed and signed by AoA and the prospective grantee prior to the issuance of
the award.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To develop effective and efficient systems of home and community based care (HCBC), States must promote the informed
participation of consumers in the planning, development and delivery of services. For consumers to have meaningful
input, they need information and better organization. Consumers need to be informed about the complex issues relating
to governance and management of the HCBC system, including linkages with the institutional and acute care systems;
resource allocation and cost controls; access to services, including eligibility, assessment, and care planning
and coordination; and the scope, organization and quality of services. This information should serve to empower
consumers to become partners in the planning and implementation of state and community HCBC systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of critical importance is the mobilization and organization of consumers at state and community levels. Effective
input into systems development and implementation can be achieved only through the collaboration of individuals
and interest groups at all levels within the State. Collective action by consumers, based on sound information, will
result in consumer-driven HCBC which is available, accessible and appropriate in relation to defined needs within
allocated resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration on Aging is interested in receiving applications for conducting statewide demonstration projects
resulting in replicable models of consumer involvement in the design, development, and implementation of home and
community based care systems. Such models of consumer-driven HCBC may be targeted to the elderly, or to the elderly
in concert with other target populations (e.g. persons with disabilities). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed projects should emphasize empowering individuals and groups at state and community levels to participate
in the development of consumer-driven systems of home and community-based care. Applicants must identify the resources
and mechanisms for developing and disseminating information, and for the mobilization and organization of individuals
and groups to impact on HCBC policy, programs and services. Applicants should also focus on the development and implementation
of mechanisms that would allow formal consumer input. Applications should address how proposed strategies will
be targeted or modified to reach special populations such as low income and minority individuals and residents of
rural areas. Innovative approaches are highly encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals are invited from public and private non-profit organizations with demonstrated experience in representing
and serving consumers of home and community based care. The Administration on Aging plans to make 4&hyph;6 awards
with an approximate federal share of $125,000 per year for an estimated project period of two (2) years. The

1.2&blank;Capacity Building and Mentoring Program in Home and Community Based Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the absence of a cohesive federal policy on long-term care, States have been in the forefront of developing home
and community-based care infrastructures. The staff of certain State Agencies on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging
have significant knowledge and experience in the design, promotion, and implementation of home and community based
systems. At the same time, the development of state systems has been an uneven process, with some States having achieved
comprehensive statewide programs of home and community-based care while others are just now beginning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As highlighted in Part I of this Announcement, home and community based care is one of the Assistant Secretary for Aging's
priorities. In the past, the Administration on Aging has funded substantial demonstration and research projects
in this area and continues to do so. However, an understanding of, and experience in, the development of state home
and community based care infrastructures constitute a unique body of knowledge. It encompasses creating systems
to assure quality of care, maximizing consumer choice and participation, developing financing mechanisms and budgetary
systems, and understanding the pertinent policy environment. AoA's 1993 Home and Community Based Care Survey of
all fifty States documented a variety of technical assistance and capacity-building needs in these areas.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Although research can identify critical issues and evaluate alternatives, it seldom addresses the practical, hands-on
decisions that accompany the design and establishment of a statewide system. The definitive textbook or curriculum
on how to build state home and community-based care infrastructures has yet to emerge. This priority area is based
on the conviction that AoA can best facilitate the development of state home and community based infrastructures
by supporting the exchange of accumulated knowledge, expertise, and hard-earned lessons. Accordingly, AoA is soliciting
applications to design and administer a capacity-building/mentoring program in home and community based care.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of the capacity-building/mentoring program is to assist States in the development of home and community-based
care infrastructure by: (1) using the expertise and knowledge of State and Area Agency on Aging staff who have demonstrated
leadership in creating innovative systems in their States; (2) drawing from other pertinent areas of knowledge and
experience (e.g. the establishment of Medicaid waiver programs, Independent Living Centers, etc.) and; (3) providing
peer consultation to States whose leadership has a commitment to improving their state system and recognizes the
need for technical assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must present an overall agenda and set of activities/approaches for conducting the project over a three
year period, as well as provide a detailed first year plan for how the capacity-building/mentoring program will be
developed, organized, and implemented. Applications must specify the mechanisms that the applicant intends to
use to promote the hands-on exchange of expertise and peer consultation. These mechanisms could include but are not
limited to sabbaticals, conferences, partial placement, on-site job placement, intergovernmental transfers,
and other innovative techniques. Applicants should bear in mind that in order to accomodate both the needs of States
receiving peer consultation and of those providing peer consultation, multiple approaches or mechanisms will most
likely be needed. In justifying their proposed courses of action, applicants should also demonstrate how these activities
are designed to maximize the funds available to accomplish the stated goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA expects to fund one capacity-building/mentoring program in home and community based care with a federal share
of approximately $300,000 per year for three years. The deadline date

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
October 7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any public or private non-profit agency or organization is eligible to apply. However, the applicant must have extensive
knowledge of home and community-based care systems and the ability to identify key capacity-building needs regarding
state infrastructure, to select and recruit exemplary State and Area Agency on Aging staff to provide peer consultation,
to match States with the appropriate peer consultants, and to coordinate all arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant selected will be awarded a Cooperative Agreement for a three-year project period. AoA and the organization/institution
selected will work cooperatively to design and implement the capacity-building/mentoring project. Each year AoA
and the grantee will negotiate a scope of work with relevant time tables and objectives. The project shall have a director
with an appropriate background and qualifications relevant to aging and disability, long term care, systems development,
and policy studies who shall devote a minimum of 50% of his/her time to this position.

1.3 Aging and Disability: Models for Coordinated Service Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ongoing debate about health care reform, long term care and disability are clear indicators of the need for the
aging, disability and rehabilitation communities to work more closely together. The Administration on Aging seeks
proposals from State and Area Agencies on Aging, State agencies serving the disabled, Tribal organizations, and
national organizations and providers to examine the issues and establish models relating to the coordination of
services for the frail elderly and the disabled, a promising recent development in several state systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the past few years, the Administration on Aging has established working relationships with organizations such
as the Administration on Developmental Disabilities and the National Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation
Research of the Department of Education to better serve older adults with disabilities and their families. This priority
area will extend these ties to the grass roots, state and local levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recent analysis of information from State Agencies on Aging indicates that at least eighteen State Aging Agencies
have some policy or program management responsibility for the disabled. The Administration on Aging wishes to further
explore potential opportunities for interaction, coordination and joint partnerships between the aging network
and the disability community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals submitted under this priority area relate to the development of a coordinated service system. Proposals
must include evidence of collaboration between the aging community and network of organizations serving the disabled.
Joint applications may be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Coordinated Service Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There seems to be a fairly common assumption that specific programs for the disabled and the elderly, which were established
under separate legislation, are quite different from each other even though the policy objectives for the two target
groups have some similarities. Programs for the elderly promote maximum independence through access to a comprehensive,
community based service delivery system. Programs for the disabled place high value on enhancing personal autonomy,
promoting consumer choice and supporting independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An examination of the similarities between the two programs raises speculation regarding ``turf'' issues and the
legislative mandates regarding advocacy for the two constituent groups. In the interest of making programs more
responsive and cost effective, a very different environment exists for strategizing about how to use available resources
more effectively. The aging network preference for a ``non-medical'' model of home and community based long term
care may raise some concern as to whether clients of the two programs have comparable needs. Some may view programs
for the disabled as too closely tied to the medical or health care system. Another factor in this equation is how will
an aging disabled population, which benefitted from rehabilitation programs initiated in the 1970s, affect demand
for aging services as the disabled grow older.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications funded under this section should result in the development of effective and innovative models which
demonstrate linkage of the aging and disability networks. These models can build on existing models that have been
successfully implemented by public and private organizations at the national, state and local levels. Projects
may focus on various aspects of systems development such as access/care coordination, quality assurance, management
of home and community based care, interagency coordination and the financing mechanisms employed by the two different
groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing new models, successful applicants will seek the advice, input and cooperation of experts and practitioners
in the aging and disability fields. Program activities may include conferences, work groups for the design of new
approaches, and development of issue papers. Applications should include provision for wide dissemination of the
new model and a plan for marketing the model to others in a manner which actively encourages and facilitates opportunities
for replication.

Under this priority area, AoA expects to make approximately 4&hyph;6 awards with a federal share of up to $150,000

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home care remains one of the fastest growing workforce areas in today's economy. This growth will only increase as
the emphasis on home and community based long term care continues, especially if provisions for such care are included
in a health care reform bill approved by the Congress. However, shortages of home care workers affect the access older
and disabled persons have to needed care, as well as the continuity and quality of care they receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This priority area addresses the need for demonstrating approaches to increasing the size and stability of the home
care workforce by employing public assistance recipients, a group of persons typically outside the workforce. It
also reflects the Administration's commitment under proposed welfare reform to foster gainful work for those caught
in the current welfare system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many past efforts to employ persons on welfare in the home care workforce have been unsuccessful. A major deterrent
has been the perception_and in some States the reality_that welfare payments and Medicaid benefits exceed the wages
and benefits offered by the home care industry. This priority area is intended to demonstrate that this deterrent
and others can be overcome by replicating existing, proven approaches or developing new approaches for employing
welfare recipients in home care.

Examples of existing approaches that merit consideration for replication are described below. Information on these
programs is available by calling the Office of Program Development at 202&hyph;619&hyph;0441.

&bull;Denver Department of Social Services (DSS) project ``Apprenticeships for Health Services Paraprofessionals''_This
approach, funded two years ago by AoA, successfully trained, placed, and provided initial career advancement ladders
for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients in nursing aide/home health aide positions. This was
done in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services' Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS)
program and the Department of Labor's first successful nurses assistant/home health aide apprenticeship program.
One key to the success of the Denver project was creative mixing of Title IV discretionary funding with those of others
available in the community, e.g. Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), JOBS, and adult education, etc. The project
also featured careful participant screening, extensive case management, mentoring, and supportive services,
one year of training, internships, and apprenticeships resulting in an apprenticeship certification, guaranteed
jobs and benefits, and guidance in future career paths.

&bull;Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA)_The CHCA program was established in the South Bronx in 1985 as a worker-owned
cooperative that allows employees to participate in decision making about all aspects of the organization. They
primarily train and employ single mothers who have previously been on welfare. After new employees complete a trial
period, they can become worker-owners by pledging a member-equity investment, which can be deducted from weekly
pay. The agency's wages are among the highest in the home care industry and the agency provides raises based on seniority.
All employees receive health insurance, paid vacation, and sick time. The agency has provided funding for senior
paraprofessionals to become LPNs. The annual turnover is less than 20 percent, far below the industry average.

As the nation engages in a debate to develop a national long term care strategy, it is important to recognize that a successful
strategy must include choices for a wide range of housing options to serve as an alternative to institutionalization.
For several reasons, among them the high likelihood that it can and does function as a service delivery point, housing
is a significant factor which can affect how long term care home and community based services are delivered and financed.
Too frequently, the significance of housing options and living arrangements have not been taken into sufficient
consideration in attempts to develop comprehensive, coordinated long term care systems.

Over the past several years AoA has supported a number of initiatives to expand elderly housing options. Our goal has
been to increase the capacity of the aging network to work with other networks such as housing, finance, real estate,
homebuilders, etc., and provide public education and information to the elderly and their families to make informed
decisions about their housing choices. Important programmatic initiatives were launched in home equity conversion,
shared housing, consumer housing information services, supportive services in federally assisted housing, accessory
apartments, land use and zoning, home modifications and models for State Agency on Aging leadership roles in federally
assisted housing. AoA has worked in partnership with other organizations, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
to implement major initiatives in elderly housing.

Despite these many program efforts elderly housing continues to be a complex subject which requires ongoing attention.
It involves numerous levels of government and many public and private agencies. Because of the complexity of the subject
it has been difficult for the aging network and others to develop comprehensive and coordinated approaches. Program
development has been inhibited by a lack of up-to-date information, knowledge, expertise, and resources.

Because housing and supportive services are vital and integral components of home and community based long term care
services, this priority area seeks to establish a National Long Term Care Policy and Resource Center for Housing and
Supportive Services. The Center's mission is to provide a focal point for the development of long term care home and
community based services specializing in elderly housing and supportive services. In particular, applicants must
demonstrate an awareness of the special housing needs of older women, minorities and elderly residents of public
housing. Applicants must propose a strategy for addressing these issues and incorporating specific activities
into their applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In September of 1993, the Administration on Aging, pursuant to Section 407 of the Older Americans Act Amendments of
1992, funded four applications to establish and operate National Resource Centers for Long Term Care. The Centers
are responsible for conducting research, disseminating information, and providing training and technical assistance
aimed at improving national, state, and local programs for the provision of home and community based long term care.
The proposed National Long Term Care Policy and Resource Center for Housing and Supportive Services will complement
and coordinate its efforts with the four current Centers, together constituting a broad, multifaceted source of
knowledge, information, training, and technical assistance to national, state, and local organizations and agencies
working to build a comprehensive, accessible, and effective long term care system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Center will support State and Area Agencies on Aging as they promote the development of community based systems
of services for older persons throughout their State. The Center will also assist AoA to develop successful strategies
and approaches for coordinating program efforts with those programs administered by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development that affect housing for the elderly and disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Center will focus its efforts on analyzing and synthesizing available knowledge; putting it in a format which
is useful to planners, practitioners, and others; conducting training based upon it; and promoting the dissemination
and utilization of this knowledge in efforts to expand housing options and supportive services for older persons.
Special emphasis is to be placed upon those activities which support improved and close coordination between Older
Americans Act programs and programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This
special emphasis should aid State and Area Agencies in gaining timely information about new legislative and policy
issues related to federal housing programs. In addition, the following activities should be undertaken on a national
scope: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Training and technical assistance to help agencies in the Aging Network and other organizations and agencies working
in the field of long term care on policy and practice issues through such means as telephone consultation, written
products and materials, teleconferencing, workshops, and conference presentations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Public education and information dissemination that will result in effective sharing of the latest thinking,
methods and findings with State Agencies on Aging, Area Agencies on Aging, legislative officials, service providers,
researchers, educators, and the public. Applicants are encouraged to develop innovative media and marketing approaches
to reaching elderly consumers and to targeting special audiences and key decision makers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Knowledge building and policy analysis oriented toward results and products which have practical application
and immediate use to those working on housing and supportive services, e.g., the development and/or modeling of a
useful instrument or tool; preparation of educational, practice, and technical assistance materials; an analysis
of key issues of concern relative to a particular subject. Applicants should have the capacity to meet the need for
short-term policy analysis on topics relating to housing, supportive services, and long term care. Based on a high
level of knowledge and information synthesis, applicants should propose possible subjects for policy analysis
but also demonstrate that they possess the capacity to respond flexibly and quickly to such needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any public or nonprofit agency, organization, or institution is eligible to apply under this priority area. However,
to merit serious consideration, an applicant must demonstrate that it has (1) extensive knowledge and experience
in the area of housing and supportive services, (2) a record of relevant achievement in this area, and (3) the requisite
organizational capability to carry out the activities of a Resource Center on a nationwide scale. AoA and the organization/institution
selected to serve as the National Long Term Care Policy and Resource Center for Housing and Supportive Services will
work cooperatively in the development of its scope of work and agenda of major events and activities. (However, applicants
are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years based on their assessment of salient issues).
The National Long Term Care Policy and Resource Center for Housing and Supportive Services shall have a Director with
an appropriate background and qualifications in aging and policy studies who shall devote a minimum of 50% of her/his
time to this position.

AoA expects to fund the National Long Term Care Policy and Resource Center for Housing and Supportive Services through
a cooperative agreement award for a period of three years. The federal share of Center project costs will be $300,000
for year one and $400,000 per year for years two and three. The deadline date for submitting applications under this
priority is July 12, 1994.

In this fast-paced era where most women work outside the home and adult children of aging parents frequently live far
from their aging relatives, it has become more and more imperative that older people and their caregivers have access
to information about where to get services necessary to assist older persons in meeting their needs within their own
communities. As the number of agencies and organizations providing home and community based services to older persons
proliferates, there is a need to assist people in finding the right kind of service for their particular need. Especially
useful would be information and assistance for frail elderly and their families on accessing home and community based
services. Frequently, people seeking service for their aged loved ones are not aware of where to get information about
services that may be available nor are they aware of the existence of the network of aging services at the local level.

Information and assistance or information and referral as it may be more commonly known, is a mandated service under
the Older Americans Act. Each Area Agency on Aging must provide this service either itself or through contract to serve
the older population in its planning and service area. In a 1988 study of Information and Referral (I&amp;R) systems
funded by AoA, two problems were identified. First, significant variation was found in both the quality and quantity
of I&amp;R services available throughout the country. Second, people in local communities and particularly long-distance
caregivers had difficulty in finding out about available services in the community in which their loved one resided.
This feasibility study found strong support among State and Area Agencies on Aging for a national locator service
to build on and not duplicate or replace the existing I&amp;R services, a national locator service which would target
long distance caregivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these concerns, the Administration on Aging in 1990 funded the development and implementation of the
Eldercare Locator. This national 800 telephone number is designed to help direct both local and long-distance caregivers
to the appropriate source of information about services in every locality in the United States. Callers identify
the county, city or zip code in which the older person lives and describe the type of services they are looking for. The
operator then directs them to a local Information and Referral number, an Area Agency on Aging or the number of the particular
service which has been identified and the caller makes the local contact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Eldercare Locator began service in December 1991 on a limited basis in the Northeast States. Over the next year,
the Locator service was expanded in stages to other parts of the country, becoming nationwide in December 1992. The
Locator serves all 50 States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the American Trust Territories. It is operational
from 9 AM EST until 11 PM EST. In January, 1994, additional operators and telephone lines were added to increase the
ability of the Locator to serve additional clients with reduced waiting times. Prior to January, 1994, the Locator
was able to serve an average of 4000 callers a month. This figure will be significantly increased with the addition
of the new operators and lines and expanded times, although no figures were available at the time of publication of
this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Eldercare Locator is a part of an AoA Initiative begun in 1990 to improve access to and quality of I&amp;R assistance
that older people and their caregivers receive. The I&amp;R Initiative focused on heightening recognition of the
pivotal role this service plays in a comprehensive and coordinated system of community based long term care services.
The AoA Initiative focused on enhancing: the quality of I&amp;R systems; the professionalism of staff operating
I&amp;R systems; the visibility of I&amp;R systems for older persons; access to existing I&amp;R services; and the
availability of I&amp;R services to those elderly at risk of losing their independence. Under the Initiative, AoA
funded both the Locator and a National Information and Referral Support Center which provides training and technical
assistance to State and Area Agency on Aging Information and Referral programs and assists them in strengthening
and expanding their services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration on Aging is soliciting proposals, under a new competition, to continue the Eldercare Locator
and the National Information and Referral Support Center. Continued support for the Locator is aimed at strengthening
and expanding its services, increasing public awareness and understanding of the Locator, and enhancing the access
of older people and their caregivers to community based long term care services. In addition to the continuation and
expansion of the basic Locator service, the following activities should be undertaken by the grantee: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Continuous update of the database with a new survey of the Area Agencies on Aging to determine whether the database
should be expanded and if so, how. The results of this survey should be reflected in further refinements of the database.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An evaluation of the Locator service should be conducted within the first year. A previous evaluation of the
service conducted prior to implementation of nationwide service indicated that 78% of users were satisfied with
the service and would use it again. Since the service will have been operational for over two years by the time a new evaluation
is undertaken, it is necessary to look at consumer satisfaction at this point in time as well as how the service could
be improved. Other factors that should be examined are the efficiency and effectiveness of the services compared
to the overall cost per average call. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Either as part of the evaluation or as a separate study, an investigation should be conducted on the impact of
changing technology on the future of information-based services particularly as it would impact on the Eldercare
Locator. For example, in the future, might it be feasible and what are the cost implications of patching callers directly
through to local I&amp;R services.

&bull;A major public relations/publicity campaign should be conducted designed to reach the maximum number of older
people and their caregivers informing them about the availability of the Locator. With the increasing number of Baby
Boomers being put in the position of having to care for or find care for their aging parents, it is necessary to educate
this group not only where to go to find services but what kind of services they should be looking for. One of the results
of the evaluation that was conducted after the first six months of operation of the Locator indicated that use of the
Locator by minority populations was limited. Special emphasis should be directed toward outreach to minority populations
and increasing use of the Locator by these groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In its public relations and outreach activities, the grantee should encourage participation and support
by private and voluntary organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Locator should consider the possibility of creating a linkage with the Department of Defense and its military
family support centers. Frequently, military family support centers get inquiries from members of the military
about their aging relatives and where to go to get services for them. This would be a logical area in which the grantee
could promote the use of the Locator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;With the advent of elder rights systems being formalized as a result of the implementation of Title VII of the
Older Americans Act, the Locator should examine the possible role of Information and Referral services as a gateway
to elder rights systems. As these systems develop, the Locator and the I&amp;R Support Center should examine the potential
of structuring relationships between these services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Locator depends on the maintenance of quality information and referral services at the state and local level,
attention must continue to be focused on upgrading these services through training and technical assistance for
state and local Information and Referral service programs. AoA proposes to continue and expand the National Information
and Referral Support Center. The Support Center should provide training and technical assistance, capacity building,
long range development, assistance in system upgrade, implementation of standards for I&amp;R services, and other
services related to the maintenance of high quality service among state and local information and referral services.
In addition, the Support Center should, in an advisory capacity, support the operation of the Locator and help coordinate
the Locator with State Aging Agency and local information and referral networks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current Eldercare Locator project has been in operation since the summer of 1990 under the auspices of the National
Association of Area Agencies on Aging. The National Information and Referral Support Center has been operated since
the summer of 1990 by the National Association of State Units on Aging. Information regarding the Locator and the Information
and Referral Support Center is available by calling the Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging at

Because of their longevity and lengthier retirement periods, the health, economic and social problems of the elderly
are more often problems of women. As described earlier in this document under the Assistant Secretary's Initiative
on Older Women, older women are clearly a population at risk. It is imperative that policy makers at all levels, aging
organizations, other national organizations, and service providers begin to recognize and respond to the unique
needs and concerns of older women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this priority area, the Administration on Aging is soliciting proposals for the establishment of a National
Policy and Resource Center for Older Women. The Center is expected to assist the Administration on Aging in focusing
national attention on the contributions and problems of older women, with particular emphasis on the issues of income
security, caregiving, health, and housing.

As the population ages, one of the primary challenges facing decision makers will be how to enhance the quality of life
for older women, the vast majority of the older population. Without specific interventions and strategies designed
to improve the status of current and future generations of older women, they will continue to face higher poverty rates,
to bear a disproportionate share of caregiving burdens_frequently without access to caregiving when they need it_and
to suffer from more chronic illnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Single elderly women are particularly at risk. A 1991 report of the Advisory Council on Social Security projects that
single elderly women in the baby boom generation will have lower levels of income and wealth than single elderly men
or elderly couples. In fact, the economic well-being of single elderly women will continue to decline relative to
that of elderly couples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Younger and mid-life women must realize that their decisions and actions now will have a considerable impact on how
they live as older women. Society in general needs to reinforce the capacity of older women to contribute and to be less
dependent upon public benefits as they age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA believes that a National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women can play a significant role in fostering a nationwide
dialogue about how to improve the status of older women. The goals of the National Policy and Resource Center for Older
Women are to encourage greater national responsiveness to the concerns of older women through the identification
of critical issues; to educate key actors such as older women themselves, policy makers, the Aging Network, and national
aging and women's organizations; and to prepare relevant policy analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants under this priority area must discuss the overall agenda and activities of the Center over a three year
period and provide a detailed first year plan for how the Center will address caregiving, income security, housing,
and health issues as they relate to older women. The program design should clearly demonstrate how individual activities
and projects are part of and contribute to the development of a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of
life for America's older women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, applicants must show how they will carry out the following activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All consumer education and dissemination activities should focus on transmitting information on caregiving, health,
income security, housing and other relevant issues to older women at the grassroots level. Many useful materials
and products have been developed but have not reached the older women who would benefit from them. Applicants are encouraged
to develop innovative approaches to consumer education and dissemination. Also, proposals should specify how they
will work with the Aging Network as well as other networks to disseminate relevant information to women at the local
level. In particular, education efforts should recognize the diversity of older women in terms of race, ethnicity,
class, and other factors.

Education and technical assistance activities should target members of the Aging Network and national women's organizations
as well as policy makers at all levels. Both aging and women's organizations need to become more responsive to the needs
of older women and to recognize their areas of common interest. Policy makers at all levels must realize the necessity
of planning not only for an aging society but also for a society that will be predominantly female and old.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Research, development, and policy analysis should be oriented toward results and products which have practical
application and immediate use to those working on older women issues, e.g., the development and/or modeling of a useful
instrument or tool; preparation of educational, practice, and technical assistance materials; an analysis of key
issues of concern relative to a particular subject. Applicants should have the capacity to meet the need for short-term
policy analysis on topics relating to older women. Based on a high level of knowledge and information synthesis, applicants
should propose possible subjects for policy analysis but also demonstrate that they possess the capacity to respond
flexibly and quickly to such needs.

for a three year period, with a federal share of approximately $300,000 for the first year; $400,000 for the second
year; and $400,000 for the third year. AoA and the organization/institution selected to serve as the National Policy
and Resource Center for Older Women will work cooperatively in the development of its scope of work and agenda of major
events and activities. (However, applicants are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years
based on their assessment of salient issues). The National Policy and Resource Center for Older Women shall have a
Director with an appropriate background and qualifications in aging and policy studies who shall devote a minimum
of 50% of her/his time to this position. The deadline for submission of applications under this priority area is October
7, 1994.

2.2&blank;Protecting Older Women Against Domestic Violence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Physical and sexual violence against women is a serious problem. Millions of women are assaulted by their intimate
partners each year. Nearly one quarter of women in the United States will be abused by a current or former partner some
time during their lives. This violence causes serious physical, psychological, and social consequences for these
women.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Domestic violence is an ongoing, debilitating experience with profound dehumanizing consequences: the battering
of body and soul; the increased isolation from the outside world; the toll on personal freedom, and; the foreboding
sense that countervailing resources are beyond one's grasp. Whenever a woman is placed in physical danger or controlled
by threat or use of physical force, she has been abused. The risk is greatest when a woman is separated from supportive
networks. Physical/sexual abuse is recurrent and escalates in frequency and severity. It is often accompanied by
emotional and psychological abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Older women who experience domestic violence are in a unique situation, compared to younger women. They may have endured
a violent relationship for years or the abuse may begin late in the life of a relationship, brought on by age-related
changes in either or both partners, such as retirement or declining physical and mental health. In trying to leave
a violent relationship, older women face obstacles that are different from those faced by younger battered women,
obstacles linked to family relationships, health, employment, finances, and to the psychological costs of starting
over late in life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although older battered women can turn to the domestic violence/domestic abuse system, few do. With some notable
exceptions, most local domestic violence programs do not address the needs or concerns of older women. Efforts focus
on younger women and women with children. Staff are not familiar with the aging process. In addition, the majority
of shelters have not been accessible to older women with physical disabilities, although the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) of 1992 will undoubtedly provide an impetus for change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications are invited from public and non-profit organizations engaged in implementing either local domestic
abuse programs or statewide domestic violence programs. Applications should include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A plan for providing services designed to meet the physical, psychological, and economic needs of older women,
including physically disabled women; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A plan that demonstrates a coordinated systems approach to gaining the cooperation of community agencies such
as aging services providers, domestic violence shelters, religious institutions, health, emergency medical services,
mental health, legal services, law enforcement, and criminal justice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A plan that includes cross training between aging and domestic violence organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An endorsement of the program by the Area Agency on Aging if the program is local, an endorsement by the State Agency
on Aging if the program is statewide; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A plan for measuring the amount of linkages being established between the aging and domestic violence organizations,
the numbers of older women being reached through outreach programs, and the number of older women being effectively
served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the key elements which should be considered for inclusion in a coordinated system to protect older women against
domestic violence are (1) safe housing, advocacy, and support of women, (2) criminal justice system action, (3) effective
civil protection, (4) counseling/education groups for the men who batter, (5) systems cooperation, and (6) coordination,
participation by, and accountability to battered women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All public and nonprofit agencies and organizations are eligible to apply under this priority area. Applicants must
demonstrate a strong knowledge base and an extensive experience of providing services to women who are victims of
domestic violence. Preference will be given to applicants with demonstrated extensive experience in providing
services to older women. As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to develop close linkages with State and Area
Agencies on Aging in the development of the application and the implementation of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA expects to fund approximately 3&hyph;5 projects under this priority area with a federal share of approximately
$125,000 per year and an estimated project period of two (2) years. The deadline date for submission of applications
under this priority area is July 12, 1994.

Optimal nutritional status is essential to the well-being, health, independence, and quality of life for everyone,
from well, healthy individuals to frail, vulnerable, functionally impaired individuals. Access to adequate food
that provides essential nutrients is a daily issue for all Americans, but becomes a more significant issue if an individual
is elderly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most experts agree that adequate nutrition is vital to helping older individuals remain independent, avoiding premature
nursing home placement or using expensive health care services. Appropriate nutrition promotes health, prevents
or delays the onset of disease, aids in recovery from illness and trauma, reduces incidence of hospitalization and
rehospitalization, helps delay further declines in already functionally impaired individuals, fosters continued
independent living in the community, and even plays a role in helping individuals who are terminally ill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging have important responsibilities for promoting
good nutrition and preventing malnutrition in the nation's older population. This priority area, which calls for
the establishment of a National Resource and Policy Center on Nutrition and Aging, underscores the need for better
knowledge, better information, and better trained personnel to better serve malnourished older persons. Under
the Older Americans Act, AoA and the aging and nutrition service network of 57 State Units on Aging, 670 Area Agencies
on Aging, 224 Title VI Grantees, and 15,000 nutrition sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve approximately 243,150,000 meals to approximately 3.5 million people. Yet a study by the Urban Institute (November-1993)
indicates that although community nutrition programs are reaching some of the at-risk older population, only about
one-third of those in need are currently being served and that these programs are stretched to their financial limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing both the importance of good nutrition for all older Americans and that nutrition services are an integral
component of home and community based long term care services, the Assistant Secretary on Aging has established a
Nutrition/Malnutrition Initiative that focuses on the prevention of malnutrition and food insecurity and the promotion
of good nutritional practices. The Initiative places responsibility on AoA to undertake four interrelated strategies:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Increasing the awareness of consumers, providers, administrators, and policymakers regarding the importance
of good nutrition among the aging population and its role in home and community based long term care services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Providing leadership among various agencies and organizations including the aging and nutrition networks in
promoting a nutrition agenda for the future; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Developing and promoting direct prevention and intervention strategies which will enhance the nutritional
status of older individuals and nutrition programs at all levels; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Developing public policies which will ensure greater access to appropriate food and nutrition services for older
individuals, especially low-income, minority, and those at nutritional risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration on Aging and the National Resource and Policy Center on Nutrition and Aging, to be established
under this priority area, will work through a Cooperative Agreement in implementing the Nutrition/Malnutrition
Initiative to promote and improve nutritional and health status for older Americans. The Center will focus on the
following three activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Information Dissemination: Applications should include effective methods for sharing the latest thinking,
methods and findings regarding nutrition/malnutrition and the elderly with the Aging Network, service providers,
researchers, educators, private industry and the public. The Center will also be responsible for developing a media
campaign to educate consumers, providers, the private sector and policy makers about the issues and interrelationships
of adequate nutrition, malnutrition, hunger and food insecurity on health, independence, and quality of life for
older individuals. Applications must describe what outcomes and impacts are anticipated as a result of the information
dissemination efforts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Training and Technical Assistance: Applications should describe how the Center will assist agencies in the Aging
Network and other organizations and agencies that work in the field of nutrition and aging to develop effective strategies
for preventing malnutrition and promoting good nutrition at the community level. Such activities should include
encouraging leadership within communities to identify and strengthen community supports; developing strategies
to enable these entities to intervene in innovative ways, developing direct prevention and intervention strategies,
and; encouraging new partnerships with the private sector. Applications must describe what outcomes and impacts
are anticipated as a result of the training and technical assistance efforts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Knowledge Building and Policy Analysis: Applications should describe how the proposed Center proposes to assist
AoA and the Aging Network through the conduct of research for improving the nutritional well being of older adults
particularly the vulnerable and at risk populations. Research is to be limited to short term studies with practical
and useful products that develop, enhance, or promote knowledge of and solutions to issues surrounding malnutrition
and nutrition with respect to older people. Applications must describe what outcomes and impacts are anticipated
as a result of the research and policy development efforts. Applicants should have the capacity to meet the need for
short-term policy analysis on topics relating to nutrition/malnutrition and the elderly. Based on a high level of
knowledge and information synthesis, applicants should propose possible subjects for policy analysis but also
demonstrate that they possess the capacity to respond flexibly and quickly to such needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA and the organization/institution selected to serve as the National Policy and Resource Center on Nutrition and
Aging will work cooperatively in the development of its scope of work and agenda of major events and activities. (However,
applicants are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years based on their assessment of salient
issues). AoA will share with the Center information on other federally supported projects and activities relevant
to malnutrition, nutrition, and the elderly. The Center shall have a Director with an appropriate background and
qualifications in aging and policy studies who shall devote a minimum of 50% of her/his time to this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA expects to fund the National Policy and Resource Center on Nutrition and Aging through a cooperative agreement
award for a period of three years. The federal share for the first year will be $300,000 with second and third year federal
funding at $400,000 per year. The deadline date for submission of applications under this priority is October 7, 1994.
Eligible applicants for the Center are public and private non-profit organizations with knowledge and experience
regarding nutrition, malnutrition, nutrition programs and nutritional needs of the elderly.

The Administration on Aging is soliciting proposals, under a new competition, for the continuation of the National
Academy on Aging, which was established with funding from the Administration on Aging in FY 1991. The Academy has and
will continue to serve as a valuable source of knowledge and guidance on the critical future issues shaping a blueprint
for an aging society. It has brought together leaders in American society to discuss and debate emerging aging trends
and issues, as well as strategies regarding how they and their organizations can better meet the challenges inherent
in the graying of America. The Academy has achieved national recognition as an impartial national forum for policy
analysis and debate on the major policy issues of our current and future aging society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leaders and decision makers are increasingly aware of the challenges in responding knowledgeably and effectively
to the growth and change in our nation's older population. Leaders at national, state, and community levels_ from
public, private, and voluntary sectors alike_must become more cognizant of the transformations now taking place
toward an aging society, and be able to provide wise and timely decisions affecting the elderly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decision makers will be especially challenged by the growing numbers of two different generational segments of our
aging population: (1) Older persons at risk of losing their independence and; (2) the baby-boom generation_a cohort
of more than 70 million individuals born between 1946 and 1964, who will begin to reach retirement age in the first decade
of the 21st century. These two groups have different substantive expectations as well as different time perspectives
regarding such salient issues and challenges of an aging society as income maintenance, health security, caregiving,
and housing. The needs of vulnerable at-risk older persons are immediate and tangible, and the challenges to society
on their behalf are in many ways those described earlier in this Program Announcement under the Assistant Secretary
for Aging's Home and Community Based Long Term Care Initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The challenge to the baby-boom generation, and to the nation as a whole, is to prepare now to meet their not-too-distant
future resource needs, to act now in an intelligent and sensible fashion so that their independence is sustained in
the future. This challenge is more fully described under the Assistant Secretary for Aging's Initiative to Develop
a Blueprint for an Aging Society, also described earlier in this Program Announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goals of the Academy are to encourage greater national leadership on aging issues through the clarification of
critical issues in the field of aging, the thoughtful analysis and informed discussion of those issues in public forums,
and the reporting of those policy analyses and debates to key decisionmakers. The Academy should promote discussion
of nationwide approaches to these issues and challenges for the use and benefit of the Academy participants and as
input to the policy deliberations of federal, state, and local governments. The major outcome of Academy events and
activities should be an analytical and educational framework for better informing leaders, policy officials, and
the public about the need to plan comprehensively for the growing and diverse numbers of older Americans in the 21st
century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications should include the basics of a four-year plan for the Academy with a detailed first year agenda of symposia,
seminars, public forums, research, and analysis relative to emerging national aging issues. The applicant should
also plan on establishing short term working groups of experts organized around key aging issues whose tasks will
be to conduct independent policy analyses resulting in policy papers for the consideration of executive and legislative
officials, and others focused on aging issues. The program design for the Academy should encourage the exchange of
ideas and information that will stimulate creativity and innovation in programs and methods for meeting the needs
of the elderly. Attention should be devoted to bringing together participants with diverse points of view who are
cognizant of the most recent policy issues and background materials pertinent to the topic focus of discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the program activities developed by the Academy should be drawn from aging as well as non-aging organizations,
from both the private and public sectors. They should, however, share both an interest in aging issues and a capacity
for shaping future aging programs and policies. Participants from the field of aging may include executives of State
and Area Agencies on Aging and Tribal organizations, leaders in service provision, executives of national aging
organizations, as well as researchers, educators, futurists and others in the field of aging. Participants drawn
from outside the field of aging are expected to be composed of individuals with an impact on and interest in aging issues
and the needs of older persons at risk. This second group includes subject matter and policy area experts, business
leaders, executives from national organizations (non-aging), and leaders of public and voluntary agencies, elected
and appointed public officials, labor unions, religious bodies, civic groups, and educational institutions. It
is expected that through the programs offered by the Academy, these leaders will gain an enriched, more comprehensive
understanding of the elderly and of the challenges of shaping national, state, community, and organizational responses
to their needs. It is also expected that, through their involvement, participants will contribute their knowledge,
experience and insight on aging issues vital to the formation of enlightened national policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants for the National Academy on Aging award must be qualified to provide the high level of knowledge and the
expert analysis of issues expected of a prominent national forum for crystallizing our thinking and advancing our
agenda regarding the future aging society. The applicant should propose a faculty whose collective expertise spans
the broad range of policy and program issues in aging. It should describe how the Academy program is designed to focus
attention on the salient issue of preparing the baby boom generation for their coming retirement in an aging society
and on such other significant subjects as home and community based long term care, older women, and nutrition/malnutrition.
In that regard, the Academy will be assisted by AoA in coordinating its agenda and scope of work, as appropriate, with
the efforts of AoA-supported Resource Centers and projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the major tasks of the Academy will be to stimulate public officials, the business community, and individuals
to prepare comprehensively for retirement in the 21st century. The successful applicant must, therefore, set forth
a scope of work, and demonstrate the capacity, to analyze and synthesize a diverse set of factors and strategies for
the consideration of the public, private, and voluntary sectors in planning for the aging of the baby-boom cohort
and beyond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other features of the Academy include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The applicant selected will be awarded a Cooperative Agreement for a four-year project period. Under the Cooperative
Agreement award mechanism, the Academy will not conduct its activities on behalf of AoA but rather on a cooperative
basis with AoA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AoA will advise the organization/institution selected to serve as the National Academy on Aging on the development
of the Academy's agenda. However, applicants are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years
based on their assessment of salient contemporary and future aging policy issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The National Academy of Aging shall have its own organizational identification and visibility within the
structure of the performing organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The National Academy on Aging shall have a Director with an appropriate background and qualifications in aging
and policy studies who will devote at least 50% of her/his time to this position. Appropriately qualified individuals
shall be appointed to the Academy's faculty in full, part time, or consultant positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An Advisory Committee will be established to provide overall direction and guidance to the Academy in developing
its agenda of major events and substantive activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the cooperative agreement award instrument, the awardee organization will have the primary responsibility
for developing and implementing the activities of the Academy. The Assistant Secretary for Aging and AoA will share
with the Academy responsibility for clarifying the specific issues to be addressed by the Academy and for establishing
the short term working groups of experts to be organized around key aging policy issues. AoA will, through periodic
briefings and ongoing consultation, share with the Academy its knowledge of the issues being addressed by the Academy
as well as information about relevant activities being undertaken by others, and provide feedback to the Academy
about the usefulness to the field of its programs, forums, and other activities. The details of this relationship
will be set forth in the cooperative agreement to be developed and signed prior to issuance of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA expects to fund the National Academy on Aging through a cooperative agreement under this priority area with a federal
share of approximately $500,000 per year for a project duration of approximately four years. The deadline date for
submitting applications under this priority area is July 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA funds are to be used to support the administration of the Academy, the cost of conducting core research, conference
planning and meeting management, evaluation, and dissemination/utilization activities, including educational
programs and living expenses of those attending. As the Academy becomes more established, the strong expectation
of AoA is that the organizational sponsor of the Academy will develop additional sources of support. A plan for those
sources of support and for becoming self-sufficient must be spelled out in the application, as well as an evaluation
plan that reflects efforts for continuous improvement of Academy functions and activities and periodic independent
examination of the impact of its work.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout its history, the Older Americans Act has assigned a high priority to the development and provision of services
to those older individuals who are in greatest economic or social need, with particular attention to individuals
whose status is low income or minority. Consistent with this legislative mandate, the Assistant Secretary for Aging
has established four major initiatives which have special relevance to low income minority older persons. The four
initiatives, which are described in detail elsewhere in this Title IV Program Announcement are: (1) Home and Community
Based Long Term Care; (2) Special Concerns of Older Women; (3) Nutrition/Malnutrition Among the Elderly; and (4)
Developing a Blueprint for Future Aging Generations. This priority area is intended to underscore the stake of minority
aging populations in efforts now underway to advance these initiatives and to enlist national minority aging organizations
in these efforts to better serve and represent minority elders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The growth of the older population, the impending acceleration of that growth rate when the baby boom generation reaches
retirement age, and the implications of these developments have attracted considerable public attention. What
has not been impressed upon us so strongly is the diverse composition of our growing older population. While today,
44 million persons are over the age of 60, 14 percent of these older persons are minority. By the year 2030: older whites
are expected to grow by 197 percent; older African Americans will grow by 300 percent; and older Hispanics will grow
by 395 percent. Immigration is a primary factor in this projected growth. Combined with projections that older Pacific-Asian
and Native American persons will grow by 200 to 300 percent, these numbers will make minority elders total about 25
percent of the older population in 2030. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When we fully realize the potential impact of these numbers and the accompanying diversity they reflect, both among
and within future older populations, a number of key minority aging issues take on new dimensions. Minority elders
continue to experience a number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
barriers to home and community based long term care; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the gaps in income, health, caregiving, and housing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
faced by older minority women have reached crisis proportions; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
minority elders are more likely to be malnourished and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
need better access to nutrition programs and services; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
minority older persons are a litmus test of whether we, as a nation, can 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plan well for a diverse and equitable aging society
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this decade and well into the 21st century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National minority aging organizations_representing older persons, professionals, advocates, program planners_that
have the capacity, the experience, and the conviction to work for and with minority elders are a vital source of leadership
and action in addressing minority aging issues. They have essential roles to play: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In ensuring that home and community based care is accessible and available to at-risk minority elderly; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In meeting the special concerns of minority older women; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In targeting nutrition services to malnourished minority elderly; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In securing for minority elderly a fair opportunity to serve and be served in a diverse and equitable future aging
society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applicants under this priority area should demonstrate that their proposed projects will produce specific strategies,
with measurable outcomes, for dealing with one or more of the four (4) issue areas outlined above. The applicant should
make clear who will undertake what action under the proposed project; what the outcome, results, and intended benefits
will be; and what the potential is for the replication and reinforcement of the strategies being proposed. In particular,
the applicant must demonstrate that it has concrete plans for continuation of the proposed strategy and project activities
after the demonstration period has been completed. Thus, the effort being proposed by the applicant must not only
make tangible and significant differences in the lives of minority elderly, these changes must be seen as having a
lasting impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligible applicants under this priority area are national minority aging organizations with extensive knowledge
and experience in serving, representing, and working with minority elderly. AoA expects to fund approximately five
(5) projects under this priority area for a two-year period with an approximate federal share of $150,000 for the first
year and $100,000 for the second year of the project. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority
area is July 12, 1994.

An estimated five to seven million children suffer from chronic health conditions/disabilities; approximately
one to two million of them need help (because of disability) with activities such as feeding, dressing, or bathing
themselves. About 90 percent of these children are cared for at home. Public/formal resources for such care are in
scarce supply. Furthermore, the informal, supportive, traditional bonds within extended families and communities
are not as available as in the past. Additional resources are needed. Drawing upon the experience and good will of older
volunteers is one way to help alleviate some of the overwhelming burden that the families of disabled children so frequently
face. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Older volunteers can be a significant resource for the families of severely disabled or chronically ill children.
This has been demonstrated in recent years by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

The Family Friends program for children with disabilities or chronic illnesses was established, in 1986, by NCOA,
with funding support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In 1990, the program diversified by helping another
at-risk group, the rural poor (Rural Family Friends Help Families in Distress). That same year, NCOA introduced Family
Friends into homeless shelters for families and children. Then, in 1992, Family Friends took on a new challenge_to
give social and emotional support to families of babies who are HIV-positive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, AoA began implementation of the Volunteer Senior Aides (VSA) Program pursuant to the legislative mandate
of Section 10404 of the 1989 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). Section 10404 authorized this program for
community-based demonstrations to determine to what extent volunteer senior aides, by providing basic medical
assistance and support to disabled/chronically ill children and their families, can reduce the cost of care for such
children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program funds became available with the FY 1991 Appropriation Bill for the Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS), which provided funding under Section 1110 of the Social Security Act. Within DHHS, AoA was then assigned responsibility
for program administration and awarded grants supporting six three-year community-based VSA demonstration projects.
The six grantees are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last of these, MARC, is also conducting evaluative research on the VSA Program. The National Council on the Aging,
drawing upon its experience with Family Friends, provides technical assistance, training, and capacity-building
services to the VSA demonstrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the continuing need for and the proven success of the Family Friends/VSA, program, AoA is now soliciting
applications to develop and implement VSA projects in additional communities. Proposed projects should demonstrate
the use of Volunteer Senior Aides to assist families of disabled/chronically ill children, thereby reducing the
cost of care for such children. These projects should effectively employ the unique skills, varied experience, good
will, and availability of older volunteers in assisting the Nation's children who are severely disabled or chronically
ill.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volunteer Senior Aides projects, usually tri-generational, are designed to benefit everyone involved. The children,
who have serious, chronic illnesses or disabilities and range in age from infancy to 12 years, receive physical care,
self-help instruction, emotional support, and nurturing. Their siblings may receive greater attention or may benefit
indirectly as their family is strengthened. The parents (or, in some cases, grandparents) of these children are given
encouragement and respite_intangibles that they need to carry on. The volunteers_aged 55 and older_have a mission
and are rewarded with a sense of personal pride and accomplishment. They becomes less isolated, more involved in the
community, and develop an affectionate relationship with their new ``granddaughters'' or ``grandsons'' and/or
other family members. The community is strengthened by older citizens voluntarily providing supportive services
to younger citizens. Health care costs are reduced. And people learn to rely on each other, connecting with an ``extended
family'' in this era of disconnected families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Family Friends or VSAs are extensively trained to find the best way to help a family. The type of help depends upon what's
needed at the time. They may tutor the child, teach personal care and self-help skills, or take the child to recreational/cultural
events. These volunteers often act as advocates, serving as ``case coordinator'' and speaking on behalf of the family
to the various professionals who plan and manage the child's care. They also provide social and emotional support
and, in many cases, respite to weary parents. (Respite is provided only when the child is medically stable and by agreement
of parents, project director, and volunteer and is limited to half of the time the volunteer spends with the child.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AoA plans to fund approximately six (6) demonstration projects under this sub-priority area at a federal share of
approximately $70,000 per year for a project period of up to approximately three (3) years. The deadline date for submitting
applications under this sub-priority area is July 12, 1994. Eligible applicants are restricted to public or non-profit
community-level agencies, organizations, or institutions in communities where Family Friends or VSA projects
have not previously been funded. Each proposal should include participation of both a health care facility and a social
service agency. Proposals should include participation in the project by a project advisory board or committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals should follow the Family Friends/VSA paradigm, briefly outlined above but thoroughly documented in materials
available from NCOA's Family Friends Resource Center. Recommended materials include: Bringing Family Friends
to Your Community, a manual detailing a step-by-step approach to developing and implementing these projects; and
Family Friends_A Program Guide. Prospective applicants may call or write the Family Friends Resource Center at Telephone:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AoA plans to award one project grant under this sub-priority area to provide technical assistance and training to
the new demonstration projects. Applicants for this grant must demonstrate an extensive knowledge base relating
to Family Friends and strong experience in providing technical assistance and training to such projects. On the basis
of its strong knowledge base and its assessment of the progress of the demonstration projects, the grantee will be
expected to assist projects in implementing their demonstrations and to offer recommendations for future program
initiatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application must include a plan for assisting approximately six (6) demonstration projects. Plans should include
at least one site visit to each project and a ``cluster'' meeting for the new model projects funded under priority area
5.2A. The successful applicant under this section is responsible for assisting the six (6) funded projects with the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Providing timely and relevant background information regarding effective Family Friends programming; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Training and technical assistance in developing Family Friends programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assisting in strategic planning for the long term continuation of the programs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Conduct research studies on the VSA Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding for this award will be for approximately $80,000 per year for a project period of up to three (3) years. The deadline

5.3&blank;Volunteer Service Credit Demonstrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this priority area, the Administration on Aging is soliciting applications from public agencies and nonprofit
organizations to test new models and replicate existing models of the volunteer service credits concept. A primary
focus should be on home and community based services that help at-risk elders to continue to live in their homes, e.g.
shopping, transportation, telephone reassurance and friendly visiting, light housekeeping, and respite care.
Preference will be given to model projects which significantly involve low-income, minority, and rural elderly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic service credit concept is to give volunteers a unit of credit for each service hour performed, regardless
of the type of service, in the expectation that accrued credits will be redeemed for services by the volunteers at some
future time of need. A centralized accounting system must be maintained to keep track of credits and match up volunteers
with recipients. As a practical matter, limitations on the number and type of services offered are necessary as are
rules that govern accumulation and use of credits. After initial start-up and operation, a steady and continuing
source of core financial assistance is needed to (1) administer the system, (2) guarantee redemption of built-up
credits in those cases when the type of immediate service need cannot be met by the volunteer services then available,
and (3) off-set credit deficits incurred when recipients, because of illness or other circumstances, cannot repay
the services provided to them with volunteer effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration on Aging has funded several service credit demonstration projects in the past. Most recently
five (5) two-year service credit demonstrations were funded along with a technical assistance project. AoA funded
projects specifically designed to help volunteers become more involved in helping older people in their communities.
Of the demonstration sites funded, several utilized churches as a base for the recruitment of volunteers. One project
linked service credits in a business and industry setting. Applicants may wish to contact the AoA funded service credit
projects to learn more about the specifics of the grants. Information regarding these demonstrations may be obtained
by contacting the Office of Program Development at (202) 619&hyph;0441. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this priority area is to test the feasibility of implementing the service credit concept in new areas
and to replicate existing models in new sites. Among the possible areas for testing and replicating the service credit
concept are (1) corporate retirement benefit programs; (2) programs under the sponsorship of fraternal organizations;
(3) social and health maintenance insurance programs where volunteer services are credited with partial payment
in lieu of fees and premiums under newly-designed community long term care service packages; (4) low income housing
programs in which residents provide services to low-income minority elderly; (5) programs in residential retirement
communities; (6) programs involving union retirees; (7) employer based service credit projects under which employees
assist the elderly in their community and (8) church-based service credit programs involving assistance to low-income
minority elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants are encouraged to solicit co-sponsoring community organizations, including youth groups to donate
volunteer services to individuals who cannot become full participants of the service credit program or to compensate
older volunteers with services not provided by participants in the service credit program. Projects using co-sponsoring
organizations must incorporate this support in a manner that does not detract from the central feature of the service
credit concept of having older persons earn volunteer credits in exchange for future services when they are needed.
Accordingly, enrollment of volunteers eligible to be full participants in the program should be limited to persons
age 55 and over (spouses excepted).

AoA plans to fund approximately five (5) model volunteer service credit projects at a federal share of approximately
$50,000 per year for a period of approximately 17 months. Projects should be designed as models for testing the effectiveness
of innovative approaches to volunteerism through utilization of the service credit concept. Successful applicants
must provide a detailed plan for the management and operation of the service credit demonstration, including documentation

5.4&blank;AoA Dissemination Projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Each year, AoA invests substantial Older Americans Act Title IV resources in grant and cooperative agreement projects
to conduct research, demonstrations, and training to improve the quality and availability of services and programs
that are vital to the well-being of at-risk older persons. Dissemination is a basic component of each of these projects.
Every Title IV project is required to conduct appropriate dissemination of project results as part of its work plan.
For the many projects which are essentially knowledge transfer activities (e.g., technical assistance, public/professional
education), dissemination is the key component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced dissemination is still needed, however, to maximize the utility of Title IV projects. The urgency to improve
the effectiveness and availability of services is especially pronounced as both fiscal constraints and the number
of older Americans increase. The ultimate goal of this priority area is to maximize the utilization of Title IV project
products and results that can directly benefit older Americans in need of services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dissemination projects are expected to be especially energetic in their marketing of products and results. Projects
are expected to utilize appropriate promotional, public relations, and media campaigns in order to insure that their
outcomes receive the widest possible attention. Such campaigns should seek to educate consumers, providers (including
the Aging Network), the private sector, and policy sector about their results and to promote use of their products.
These efforts will be considered a key indicator of the scope of the impact of the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AoA Dissemination Projects funded under this priority area are also expected to foster greater awareness of the
challenges of an aging society and of the contributions, real and potential, that aging programs make in responding
to those challenges. These awareness-building efforts may take several forms, including the development and dissemination
of materials keyed to decision-making points on a particular aging issue and the use of appropriate communication
mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two types of project applications may be submitted for review and funding consideration under this priority area:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Enhanced Dissemination of Product(s) of Significant Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A major purpose of this priority area is to support more extensive dissemination of Title IV products of significant
value. In the course of performing their work, grantees sometimes develop especially valuable products which warrant
dissemination beyond that originally contemplated or for which dissemination opportunities are found which were
not envisioned earlier. Grantees who are convinced that such products are needed, and of demonstrated value to the
aging network and/or others involved in improving the availability, effectiveness, and quality of aging services,
may apply under this section for funding. (This opportunity applies to both current and former grantees whose projects
were completed within two years of the publication of this announcement). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may address the dissemination of either a single product or more than one product from a single project.
In this context, the term ``product'' may include the ``Final Report'' as well as other project products such as manuals,
handbooks, curricula, brochures, technical assistance materials, reports, audio-visual materials, etc. Applicants
applying for enhanced dissemination projects must submit a copy of the product(s) to be disseminated along with each
copy of their application. (For audio visual products, only a single copy of the product need to be submitted). This
attachment is in addition to the page limit which applies to all applications; however, the application narrative
itself may not exceed the limits described below in Part III.

B. Syntheses of ``Cluster'' Projects Results and Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A second purpose of this priority area is to support the development and dissemination of syntheses of project products/results
from earlier Title IV project ``clusters'' (e.g., projects funded under the same priority area of a previous AoA Discretionary
Funds Program announcement). Projects in a cluster may vary widely in terms of approach, outcomes, and products,
but all deal with the same subject matter or problem area. A synthesis of needed and useful products/results of these
projects may well have synergistic value, and a multiplier effect, in generating knowledge and substantiating best
practices which can be applied to the benefit of older Americans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Such a synthesis may take various forms. An applicant may synthesize exemplary products as produced_or change the
form of the product to maximize utilization. Creative adaptations may be needed. A compilation of relevant demonstration
or research results 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(and/or recommendations) from the cluster may be what is needed. Applicants are encouraged to be innovative in their
response to this priority area. The need for the synthesis should be demonstrated. A strategy for promoting utilization
must be included as part of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants proposing to synthesize the results of clusters of past projects must submit a general description of
the past projects and their outcomes not to exceed five (5) pages in length. This cluster description should be in the

may not exceed the limits described below in Part III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications of either of the types described above should carefully specify not only what dissemination activities
are to be performed but also: (1) Why the product(s) is important, (2) to whom it is important, (3) what would be the results
and benefits of dissemination and utilization of the product(s), and (4) what specific actions such as training or
technical assistance would the proposed project undertake to assist those who wish to adapt or adopt the products
and/or the recommendations contained in the products. Prospective applicants are cautioned that this priority
area may not be used simply to finish or extend the basic work of a previously funded project (under the guise of dissemination)
or to undertake the

on a subject of current or emerging significance to our nation's older population. These priority areas describe
with some particularity the nature of the activity to be undertaken, the type, scope, duration, and funding amount
of the project and, in some instances, the applicants eligible to compete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this priority area for Field-Initiated Project Applications, the focus remains on issues that matter greatly
to older people, but not necessarily those issue areas (home and community based long term care, older women, etc.)
that have already received considerable emphasis in this DFP. This priority area is intended for proposed project
initiatives that reflect a deep-seated interest in any policy, program, or related issue of importance to older Americans.
In a similar vein, the Administration on Aging fully recognizes, that there are many creative ideas, innovative approaches,
training/technical assistance/dissemination efforts, etc., which do not readily fit the designated Priority
Areas of this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. This priority area is also intended to be responsive to proposals
embodying those ideas, approaches, and efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field-initiated applications for new grant awards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are invited under the following functional sub-categories: (1) Special event/conference proposals; (2) research
and demonstration (R&amp;D) projects, and; (3) education, training, and technical assistance efforts. Current
AoA grantees seeking large-scale supplemental awards (supplements that would exceed 25% of their current project
award and/or extend their project period beyond three months) must also compete under this priority area to be eligible
for funding. To ensure that to the maximum extent possible competition will be between proposals of a comparable scope
and nature of activity, applications will be grouped according to the appropriate sub-category and be evaluated,
scored, and ranked within each of these subcategories:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) special event/conference proposals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) research and demonstration (R&amp;D) projects;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) education, training, and technical assistance efforts, and;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) large-scale supplements to currently active AoA funded project grants (supplements that would exceed 25% of
their current project award and/or extend their project period beyond three months).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants are reminded that they are competing under a national program of gerontological training, research,
demonstrations, and centers as authorized by Title IV of the Older Americans Act. Therefore, field-initiated applications
will be screened by AoA to assure that they are not local service projects, but rather are responsive to issues of national
significance and will result in findings, reports, and products with national implications. In addition, each field-initiated
application will be screened to determine that it is not, in essence, the same application that was recently disapproved
by AoA for funding. Applicants should wait a minimum of six months before resubmitting an application for consideration
under another review and award cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA has established deadlines at fixed Fiscal Year quarterly intervals for the submission of field-initiated applications
under this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement. The first deadline is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
October 7, 1994
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Subsequent deadlines are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
January 13, 1995, April 14, 1995
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
July 14, 1995.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants will be informed of their funding status within 60 days of the pertinent deadline date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the number of field-initiated proposals approved for funding can not be estimated beforehand, applicants
should be advised that only a limited amount of Title IV funds will be reserved for this priority area and only applications
of outstanding merit will be considered for funding. The federal share of project costs per year is expected to fall
within the following approximate ranges: $20,000 to $40,000 for special events/conferences; $50,000 to $100,000
depending upon the nature of the proposed research, demonstration, training, technical assistance, or related
effort; $50,000 and above for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
large-scale supplements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to current grants. The duration of new project awards could range from one (1) to two (2) years. Large scale supplements
are limited to a maximum period of twelve (12) months.

A. General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Review Process and Considerations for Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the limits of available federal funds, AoA makes financial assistance awards consistent with the purposes
of the statutory authorities governing the AoA Discretionary Funds Program and this Announcement. The following
steps are involved in the review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applicants will automatically be notified of the receipt of their application and informed of the identification
number assigned to it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Screening:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To insure that minimum standards of equity and fairness have been met, applications which do not meet the screening
criteria listed in Section D below, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
will not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be reviewed and will receive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
no
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 further consideration for funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Expert Review:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applications that conform to the requirements of this program announcement will be reviewed and scored competitively
against the evaluation criteria specified in Section F, below. This independent review of applications is performed
by panels consisting of qualified persons from outside the federal government and knowledgeable non-AoA federal
government officials. The scores and judgments of these expert reviewers are a major factor in making award decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AoA may solicit views and comments on pending applications from other federal departments and agencies, State and
Area Agencies on Aging, interested foundations, national organizations, experts, and others, for the consideration
of the Assistant Secretary for Aging in making funding decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Considerations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In making funding award decisions, the Assistant Secretary for Aging will pay particular attention to applications
which focus on older persons with the greatest economic and social need, with particular attention to the low-income
minority elderly. Final decisions will also reflect the equitable distribution of assistance among geographical
areas of the nation, and among rural and urban areas. The Assistant Secretary for Aging also guards against wasteful
duplication of effort in making funding decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Funding Sources: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AoA reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other federal or non-federal funding
sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the federal government or the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Decision-Making Process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the panel review sessions, applicants may be contacted by AoA staff to furnish additional information. Applicants
who are contacted should not assume that funding is guaranteed. An award is official only upon receipt of the Financial
Assistance Award (Form DGCM 3&hyph;785).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timeframe: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants should be aware that the time interval between the deadline for submission of applications and the award
of a grant is at least two months and often three months or more in duration. This length of time is required to review
and process grant applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Notification Under Executive Order 12372
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is not a covered program under Executive Order 12372.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Deadline for Submission of Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Program Announcement contains different deadline dates for the submission of applications, depending upon
the priority area under which an application is submitted. Please check each priority area carefully to determine
the deadline date for the application you plan to submit. Applications must be either sent or hand-delivered to the
address specified in Section D, below. Hand-delivered applications are accepted during the normal working hours
of 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. An application will meet the deadline if it is either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Received at the mailing address on or before the applicable deadline date; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sent before midnight of the applicable deadline date as evidenced by either (1) a U.S. Postal Service receipt or
postmark or (2) a receipt from a commercial carrier. The application must also be received in time to be considered
under the competitive independent review mandated by Chapter 1&hyph;62 of the DHHS Grants Administration Manual.
Applicants are strongly advised to obtain proof that the application was sent by the applicable deadline date. If
there is a question as to when an application was sent, applicants will be asked to provide proof that they have met the
applicable deadline date. Private metered postmarks are not acceptable as proof of a timely submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications which do not meet the above deadlines are considered late applications. The Office of Administration
and Management will notify each late applicant that its application will not be considered under the applicable grant
review competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AoA may extend a deadline date for applications because of acts of God, such as floods, hurricanes or earthquakes,
when there is widespread disruption of the mail, or when AoA determines an extension to be in the best interest of the
government. Depending upon the precipitating factor(s), the extension will apply to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 potential applicants in the area affected by the natural disaster, or to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 potential applicants across the nation. Notice of the extension will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Grantee Share of the Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Discretionary Funds Program, AoA does not make grant awards for the entire project cost. Successful applicants
must, at a minimum, contribute one (1) dollar, secured from non-federal sources, for every three (3) dollars received
in federal funding. The non-federal share must equal at least 25% of the total project cost. Applicants should note
that, among applications of comparable technical merit, the greater the non-federal share the more favorably the
application is likely to be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The one exception to this cost sharing formula is for applications from American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands or
the Northern Mariana Islands. Applicants from these territories are covered by Section 501(d) of Public Law 95&hyph;134,
as amended, which requires the Department to waive ``any requirement for local matching funds under $200,000.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-federal share of total project costs for each budget period may be in the form of grantee-incurred 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
direct or indirect
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 costs, third party in-kind contributions, and/or grant related income. Indirect costs may not exceed those allowed
under federal rules established, as appropriate, by OMB Circulars A&hyph;21, A&hyph;87, and A&hyph;122. If the
required non-federal share is not met by a funded project, AoA will disallow any unmatched federal dollars. A common
error is to match 25% of the federal share rather than 25% of the entire project cost.

D. Application Screening Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be screened to determine completeness and conformity to the requirements of this announcement.
These screening requirements are intended to assure a level playing field for all applicants. Applications which
fail to meet either of the two criteria described below will not be reviewed and will receive no further consideration.
Complete, conforming applications will be reviewed and scored competitively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for an application to be reviewed, it must meet the following screening requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applications must be submitted by the deadline date specified in the priority area under which the application
is submitted for competitive review and funding consideration. It is incumbent upon the applicant to clearly indicate
under what priority area the application is intended for consideration. Applications must be postmarked by midnight,
or hand-delivered by 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time, on the deadline date of the relevant priority area, to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Health and Human Services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration on Aging, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attn: AoA&hyph;94&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements specific to the priority area under which they have submitted
their application. (It bears repeating that, for everyone's benefit, the applicant should be sure that the priority
area has been clearly identified in the application). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Only Those Applications Meeting These Screening Requirements Will Be Assigned to Reviewers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to these screening requirements, the applicant is strongly advised to adhere to the following standards
in preparing the application: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The application should not exceed forty (40) pages, double-spaced, exclusive of certain required forms and assurances
which are listed below. Applications whose typescript is single-spaced or space-and-a-half will be considered
only if it is determined the applicant has not thereby gained a competitive advantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following documents are excluded from the 40 page limitation: (1) Standard Form (SF) 424, SF 424A (including up
to a four page budget justification) and SF 424B; (2) the certification forms regarding lobbying; debarment, suspension,
and other responsibility matters; and drug-free workplace requirements; (3) proof of non-profit status; (4) indirect
cost agreements; (5) attachments submitted as directed under priority area 5.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following portions of the application are subject, in the aggregate, to the forty (40) page limitation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Summary description (suggested length: one page); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Narrative (suggested length: twenty-five to thirty pages); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Applicant's capability statement, including an organization chart, and vitae for key project personnel (suggested
length: five to ten pages) and; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Letters of commitment and cooperation (suggested length: four pages).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be checked against the aggregate forty (40) page limitation. Any material, of whatever content,
in excess of the forty (40) pages will be withheld from the reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Funding Limitations on Indirect Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Training projects awards to institutions of higher education and other non-profit institutions are limited to
a federal reimbursement rate for indirect costs of eight (8) percent of the total allowable direct costs or, where
a current agreement exists, the organization's negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is lower. Differences
between the applicant's approved rate and the 8% limitation may be used as federal cost sharing. See Section J&hyph;2,
Item 6j, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For all other applicants, indirect costs generally may be requested only if the applicant has a negotiated indirect
cost rate with the Department's Division of Cost Allocation or with another federal agency. Applicants who do not
have a negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for one in accordance with DHHS procedures and in compliance with relevant
OMB Circulars.

F. Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications which pass the screening will be evaluated by an independent review panel of at least three individuals.
These reviewers, experts in the field, are from academic institutions, non-profit organizations, state and local
government, and, upon occasion, federal government agencies other than AoA. Based on the specific programmatic
considerations set forth in the priority area under which an application has been submitted, the reviewers will comment
on and score the applications, focusing their comments and scoring decisions on the criteria below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Program Narrative of the application (see Section J&hyph;6 below), applicants are expected to demonstrate
familiarity with recent and ongoing activity related to their project proposal. With respect to AoA-supported discretionary
grant projects, information on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
current AoA projects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be obtained by contacting the Office of Program Development at 202/619&hyph;0441. Regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
completed AoA projects,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 copies of all AoA discretionary grant final reports and printed materials are sent to: the National Aging Dissemination
Center; the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), a clearinghouse and document source for federally sponsored
reports; Ageline Database, a bibliographic database service sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons,
available online through BRS and DIALOG; and the U.S. Government Printing Office Library Program, a catalog and microfiche
service for 1400 depository libraries located throughout the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information concerning access to the bibliographic and document referral services provided by these clearinghouses
can be obtained through most public and academic libraries. For direct information, use the following contacts:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Dissemination Center maintains a computerized database of descriptions of recent AoA grant products including
reports, studies, training materials, technical assistance documents, and audio-visual products. Staff are available
to scan the database for products and tailored printouts may be requested. The Center has also established a product
repository of over 1000 products generated under Title IV grants. The repository serves as a backup source for original
documents from which duplicates can be produced when copies are no longer available from the grantees. Information
about products and searches of this database can be requested by telephone (800&hyph;989&hyph;6537) and by written
request. In addition, the database will also be available via modem for on-line searches (800&hyph;989&hyph;2243).

2. Dissemination and Utilization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes and expectations associated with Title IV discretionary projects extend well beyond the immediate
confines of a particular project's local impact. Projects should have a ripple effect in the field of aging in terms
of replicating their design, utilizing their results, and applying their benefits to a widening circle of older persons.
This section suggests certain principles of dissemination to be considered in developing your application: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the most useful projects make dissemination and utilization a central, not peripheral, component of the project;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;dissemination starts at the beginning of a project not when it is completed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;potential users should be involved in planning the project, if possible, and products developed with the needs
of potential users in mind; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;dissemination is a networking process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;at a minimum, dissemination includes getting your final products into the hands of appropriate users and making
presentations at conferences; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;coordination with other related projects may increase the chances of your products being used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Completing the Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In completing the application, please recognize that the set of standardized forms and instructions is prescribed
by the Office of Management and Budget (approved under OMB control number 0348&hyph;0043) and is not perfectly adaptable
to the particulars of AoA's Discretionary Funds Program. First-time applicants, in particular, may have some misgivings
that they have not crossed the final ``t'' or dotted the last ``i'' of their application. Any applicant should, of course,
take reasonable care to avoid technical errors in completing the application, but the substantive merits of the project
proposal are the determining factors. In these instructions, we offer several pointers aimed at clarifying matters,
overcoming difficulties, and preventing the more common technical mistakes made by applicants. If the need arises,
please call (202) 619&hyph;0441 for assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Enter the total costs of all equipment to be acquired by the project. For state and local governments, including federally
recognized Indian Tribes, ``equipment'' is non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more
than two years and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. For all other grantees, the threshold for equipment
is $500 or more per unit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attach a list of contractors indicating the name of the organization, the purpose of the contract, and the estimated
dollar amount. If the name of the contractor, scope of work, and estimated costs are not available or have not been negotiated,
indicate when this information will be available. Whenever the applicant/grantee intends to delegate a substantial

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Line 6j_Indirect Charges: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter the total amount of indirect charges (costs), if any. If no indirect costs are requested, enter ``none.'' Indirect
charges may be requested if: (1) the applicant has a current indirect cost rate agreement approved by the Department
of Health and Human Services or another federal agency; or (2) the applicant is a State or local government agency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Applicants other than state and local governments are requested to enclose a copy of this agreement. Local and state
governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be also charged
as direct costs to the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of training grants to other than state or local governments (as defined in 45 CFR Part 74), federal reimbursement
of indirect costs will be limited to the lesser of the negotiated (or actual) indirect cost rate or 8 percent of the amount
allowed for total project (federal and non-federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space,
tuition and fees, stipends, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations.
As part of the justification, applications subject to this limitation should specify that the federal reimbursement
will be limited to 8%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For training grant applications, the entry for line 6j should be the total indirect costs being charged to the project.
The federal share of indirect costs is calculated as shown above. The applicant's share is calculated as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Calculate total project indirect costs (a*) by applying the applicant's approved indirect cost rate to the total
project (federal and non-federal) direct costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Calculate the federal share of indirect costs (b*) at 8 percent of the amount allowed for total project (federal
and non-federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral
training allowances, contractual items, alterations and renovations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) Subtract b* from a*. The remainder is what the applicant can claim as part of its matching cost contribution.

SF 424B, Assurances_Non-Construction Programs, contains assurances required of applicants under the Discretionary
Funds Program of the Administration on Aging. Please note that a duly authorized representative of the applicant
organization must certify that the applicant is in compliance with these assurances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the possible exception of an Assurance of Protection of Human Subjects, no other assurances are required. For
research projects in which human subjects may be at risk, an Assurance of Protection of Human Subjects may be needed.
If there is a question regarding the applicability of this assurance, contact the Office for Protection from Research
Risks of the National Institutes of Health at (301) 496&hyph;7041.

4. Certification Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certifications are required of the applicant regarding (a) lobbying; (b) debarment, suspension, and other responsibility
matters; and (3) drug-free workplace requirements. Please note that a duly authorized representative of the applicant
organization must attest to the applicant's compliance with these certifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Project Summary Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On a separate page, provide a project summary description headed by two identifiers: (1) the name of the applicant
organization as shown in SF 424, item 5 and (2) the priority area as shown in the upper left hand corner of SF 424. Please
limit the summary description to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
one page
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with a maximum of 1,200 characters, including words, spaces and punctuation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The description should be specific and succinct. It should outline the objectives of the project, the approaches
to be used and the outcomes expected. At the end of the summary, list major products that will result from the proposed
project (such as manuals, data collection instruments, training packages, audio-visuals, software packages).
The project summary description, together with the information on the SF 424, becomes the project ``abstract'' which
is entered into AoA's computer data base. The project description provides the reviewer with an introduction to the
substantive parts of the application. Therefore, care should be taken to produce a summary which accurately and concisely
reflects the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Program Narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Program Narrative is the critical part of the application. It should be clear, concise, and, of course, responsive
to the priority area under which the application is being submitted. In describing your proposed project, make certain
that you respond fully to the evaluation criteria set forth in Section F above. The format of the narrative should,
in fact, parallel the criteria, beginning with an integrated discussion of (A) the project's purpose(s), relevance,
and significance, which answers the questions of why the project should be undertaken and what it intends to accomplish.
The next section of the narrative provides a detailed explanation of (B) the approach(es)/methodology the project
will follow to achieve its purpose(s), leading to a discussion of (C) the anticipated outcomes/results/benefits
of the project, how these will be evaluated, disseminated, and utilized. The narrative concludes with (D) the level
of effort needed to carry out the project, in terms of the Project Director and other key staff, funding, and other resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please have the narrative typed on one side of 81/2
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; x 11
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; plain white paper with 1'' margins on both sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, tables, maps,
exhibits, etc.) should be sequentially numbered, beginning with ``Objectives and Need for Assistance'' as page
number one. (Applicants should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The narrative should also identify the author(s) of the proposal, their relationship with the applicant, and the
role they will play, if any, should the project be funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This narrative guidance is in accordance with that provided in OMB Circular A&hyph;102. The checklist reporting
form (Section K, below) is consistent with that approved under OMB control number 0937&hyph;0189. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Organizational Capability Statement and Vitae for Key Project Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The organizational capability statement should describe how the applicant agency (or the particular division of
a larger agency which will have responsibility for this project) is organized, the nature and scope of its work and/or
the capabilities it possesses. This description should cover capabilities of the applicant not included in the program
narrative. It may include descriptions of any current or previous relevant experience or describe the competence
of the project team and its record for preparing cogent and useful reports, publications, and other products. An organizational
chart showing the relationship of the project to the current organization should be included. Vitae should be included
for key project staff only.

L. Points to Remember 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. There is a forty (40) double-spaced page limitation for the substantive parts of the application. Before submitting
your application, please check that you have adhered to this requirement which is spelled out in Section D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. You are required to send an original and two copies of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Indicate the priority area in the box at the top left hand corner of the SF 424. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The summary description (1,200 characters or less) should accurately reflect the nature and scope of the proposed
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. To meet the cost sharing requirement (see Section C above), you must, at a minimum, match $1 for every $3 requested
in federal funding to reach 25% of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
total
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 project cost. For example, if your request for federal funds is $90,000, then the required minimum match or cost sharing
is $30,000. The total project cost is $120,000, of which your $30,000 share is 25%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Indirect costs of training grants may not exceed 8%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In following the required format for preparing the program narrative, make certain that you have responded fully
to the four (4) evaluative criteria which will be used by reviewers to evaluate and score all applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include letters which endorse the project in general and perfunctory terms. In contrast, letters which describe
and verify tangible commitments to the project, e.g., funds, staff, space, should be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If duplicate applications are submitted under different priority areas, AoA reserves the right to select the single
priority area under which it will be reviewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. If more than one project application is submitted, each should be submitted under separate cover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Before submitting the application, have someone other than the author(s): 1) apply the screening requirements
to make sure you are in compliance; and 2) carry out a trial run review based upon the evaluative criteria. Take the opportunity
to consider the results of the trial run and then make whatever changes you deem appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Each application must be mailed by midnight, or hand-delivered by 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time, on the deadline date
specified in the priority area under which the application is being submitted for review and funding consideration.
Mail or hand-deliver the application to:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) to conduct an epidemiologic evaluation of
thyroid disease and exposure to radioactive fallout from United States atomic weapons testing conducted in the South
Pacific. Approximately $350,000 is available in FY 1994 to support this cooperative agreement. It is expected that
the award will begin on or about July 1, 1994, and will be awarded for a 12-month budget period within a 3-year project
period. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will
be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to support an epidemiologic study. This study will be designed to investigate
the possible relationships involving thyroid diseases in Marshall Islands residents and past environmental exposures
to radioactive fallout from the United States Atomic Weapons Testing Program conducted in the Marshall Islands between
1946 and 1958. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDC will provide guidance on program management and administrative matters; assist in developing and final approval
of the study protocol; assist in assessing historical records for morbidity and mortality; provide on-site assistance
in both planning and implementation phases; provide on-site consultation and assistance in monitoring the collection
and handling of information; assist in the statistical and epidemiologic analysis of the data; assist in interpreting
the study findings; and assemble a peer review committee to review the project protocol.

Assistance will be provided only to the RMI for conducting this study. No other applications are solicited. The Program
Announcement and application kit have been sent to RMI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RMI is the most appropriate organization to conduct the work under this cooperative agreement because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The RMI, under previous funding from the United States Government through the Compact of Free Association, is conducting
a Nationwide Radiological Study to determine the extent of residual contamination from atomic weapons tests on individual
islands in the Republic. These data will be essential for determining historical radiation exposures in Marshall
Islands residents participating in this study of thyroid morbidity. The data from this study are the property of the
Government of the Marshall Islands and are not available for public use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The RMI has already assembled a consortium of the best qualified health physicists, thyroid disease specialists,
and administrators from various institutions to conduct this study. These experts not only represent a high degree
of experience in health physics and thyroid disease studies, but they represent the principal participants in past
research of the residents of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Ministry of the Interior and Outer Island Affairs, RMI, will be able to provide inter-island radio communications,
translations to Marshallese language, and logistical support for this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The RMI has the legal responsibility for disease control in the Marshall Islands under the laws of the Republic.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed entity guidelines were announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 68922 on December 29, 1993. A comment period of 30 days was established to allow interested parties to submit
comments. The Office of Drug Pricing received 7 letters with comments concerning confidential drug pricing information,
retroactive discounts,drug diversion, audit requirements, entity participation, group purchasing, purchasing
agents, manufacturer contracts, and 4 general comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following section presents a summary of all major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment.
All comments were considered in developing this final notice. Changes were also made to increase clarity and readability.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Establish specific sanctions for entities which knowingly make unauthorized disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No change. The quoted price or the actual price given by the manufacturer to the covered entity is not confidential.
Covered entities do not have access to confidential drug pricing information (i.e., average manufacturer price
and best price).

Eligibility for Retroactive Discounts

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Do not impose a deadline on requesting retroactive discounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No change. It is a reasonable administrative decision to establish a time limit for requesting refunds. Manufacturers
were given sufficient time in which to implement the discount program, and entities were given an adequate opportunity
to elect whether to participate in the program. An entity may preserve its right to retroactive discounts, after the
deadline, by sending each manufacturer a letter requesting such refunds and providing adequate documentation of
drug purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Exclude from eligibility for retroactive discounts any disproportionate share hospital (DSH) which purchased
its outpatient drugs through a group purchasing organization (GPO).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No change. The Office of Drug Pricing considers the outpatient drug purchases of DSHs bought through a GPO or any group
purchasing arrangement ineligible for retroactive discounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Allow covered entities to request an extension of the deadline for retroactive discounts for good cause (e.g., offsite
DSH clinics whose eligibility has not yet been determined).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have amended part 3 of the notice to permit a DSH outpatient clinic which was not participating in a GPO or any group
purchasing arrangement during the period for which it is requesting retroactive discounts to preserve its right
by sending manufacturers a letter requesting such refunds and providing adequate documentation of purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Extend the deadline for those manufacturers which have refused to give PHS pricing to the date on which the manufacturer
begins discounting its covered outpatient drugs in accordance with the law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No change. At every opportunity, the Office of Drug Pricing has communicated its willingness to assist entities with
problems of accessing PHS pricing. It has responded to all entity complaints dealing with manufacturer noncompliance.
We believe that one year is a reasonable time in which to have resolved any difficulty with pricing access.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Require manufacturers to respond within 30 days to requests for retroactive discounts, even if the response is just
a request for additional information, or face possible termination from the Medicaid program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No change. Because this issue deals with manufacturer guidelines, it is beyond the scope of this notice. However,
should a covered entity have difficulty obtaining retroactive discounts, we encourage the entity to contact the
Office of Drug Pricing for assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Establish that a DSH, which did not submit its Medicaid provider number for the period for which it is requesting retroactive
discounts, would be ineligible for the refund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No change. A DSH which did not submit its Medicaid provider number may still be eligible for retroactive discounts
if it (1) did not bill Medicaid for the drugs, (2) billed for covered outpatient drugs using an all-inclusive rate,
or (3) has adequate documentation proving that drugs for which retroactive discounts are being requested did not
generate Medicaid rebates.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change. Guidelines concerning separate purchasing accounts and dispensing records are quite specific, and procedures
in these areas need no prior approval. If a manufacturer believes that a covered entity is involved in drug diversion,
it has the statutory authority to audit the entity records that directly relate to drugs of that manufacturer purchased
at PHS pricing. Proposed audit guidelines have been developed and will be published in the

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change. If a manufacturer believes that a covered entity has established inadequate safeguards and is involved
in drug diversion, then the manufacturer can either audit the entity or file a complaint with the Office of Drug Pricing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change. It is essential that the Office of Drug pricing maintain some flexibility during this period of implementation.
Because these alternate tracking systems require prior approval from the Office of Drug pricing before they can be
implemented, sufficient control is maintained. The Office will develop criteria at a later date and welcomes all
suggestions.

 We have amended part 2 of the notice to require entities to provide one of the following: (1) A pharmacy Medicaid number
(the number which the entity uses to bill Medicaid for medications), or (2) their all-inclusive Medicaid number (e.q.,
``FQ'' number), or (3) notification that it does not bill Medicaid for all outpatient drugs. These numbers will be
posted on the electronic bulletin board (Electronic Data Retrieval System or EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug
Pricing, to indicate which covered entities have elected to participate in the program. For access to the EDRS call

 We have amended part 6 of the notice to provide that entities will be added to or deleted from the eligibility list on
a quarterly basis only. The Office of Drug Pricing will update the list 2 weeks before each calendar quarter, giving
lead time for pricing changes and appropriate communications with wholesalers, GPOs, and purchasing agents.

GPO participation with respect to all complying manufacturers.

 No change. Generally, we have found that entities are receiving PHS pricing. The Office of Drug Pricing has, at every
opportunity, communicated its willingness to assist entities when there are problems with accessing PHS pricing.
The Office has investigated all complaints of manufacturer noncompliance immediately and was and is willing to take
appropriate enforcement action if necessary. This is the proper course for dealing with any manufacturer non-compliance,
rather than attempting to compensate for continued non-compliance by disregarding the statutory GPO provisions.

 We have amended part 8 of the notice to distinguish a purchasing agent from a group purchasing arrangement for purposes
of the DSH/GPO prohibition. A purchasing agent would not be considered operating as a group purchasing arrangement
if the following conditions are met: (1) the purchasing agent is not associated with a group purchasing organization;
(2) no collective bargaining by a group of hospitals occurs; (3) the negotiations of PHS pricing are separate activities
for each individual DSH; (4) a separate agreement with each DSH is executed; (5) as part of the agreement, there will
be no sharing or pricing information; and (6) all final decisions concerning product and price acceptance will be
made by each individual DSH.

 Do not require manufacturers to sell directly to a purchasing agent, a GPO, or a contract pharmacy, but solely to covered
entities and their wholesalers.

 No change. It is a customary business practice for manufacturers to sell to intermediaries as well as directly to the
entity. Entities often use purchasing agents or contract pharmacies, or participate in GPOs. By placing such limitations
on sales transactions, manufacturers could be discouraging entities from participating in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Manufacturers may not single out covered entities from their other customers for restrictive conditions that would

 We have amended part 11 of the notice to state that this prohibition against a contract between a manufacturer and a
covered entity regarding entity compliance with section 340B provisions or the Office of Drug Pricing program guidelines
does not encompass entity/manufacturer contracts that contain provisions relating to normal business activities,
requests for standard information, or other appropriate contract provisions.

 We have amended part 7 of the notice to require any group which purchases covered outpatient drugs at OHS pricing on
behalf of an eligible covered entity to have written authority from the entity to purchase its covered outpatient
drugs. The purchasing group must provide documentation of this purchase authority to the manufacturer upon request.
This rule does not supersede the statutory limitations regarding DSH participation in GPOs or group purchasing arrangements.

``Confidential drug pricing information'' includes both ``best price'' and ``average manufacturer price.'' The
quoted price and the actual price given by the manufacturer to the covered entity are not confidential.

(2) Duplicate Discount/Rebate Potential
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, a covered entity billing on a cost basis for drug purchases must provide the Office of Drug Pricing with a pharmacy
Medicaid number (the number which the entity uses to bill Medicaid for medications). Second, a covered entity using
an all-inclusive rate (either per encounter or visit) must submit its all-inclusive Medicaid number (e.g., ``FQ''
number). Third, if a covered entity does not bill Medicaid for outpatient drugs, then the entity must notify the Office
of this decision. Fourth, a large facility which houses many different clinics, only several of which are eligible,
must obtain a separate Medicaid provider number for the eligible clinics. For those States which cannot generate
additional Medicaid provider numbers for entities, covered entities must discuss an alternative arrangement with
the States to accomplish this objective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System (EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing,
to indicate which covered entities have elected to participate in the program. For access to the EDRS call (301) 594&hyph;4992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a drug is purchased by or on behalf of a Medicaid beneficiary, the amount billed may not exceed the entity's actual
acquisition cost for the drug, as charged by the manufacturer at a price consistent with the Veterans Health Care Act
of 1992, plus a reasonable dispensing fee established by the State Medicaid agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Eligibility for Retroactive Discounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Until 30 days after publication of this notice, eligible covered entities included on the initial eligibility list
may request retroactive discounts (discounts, rebates, or account credit) for covered outpatient drugs purchased
retroactive to December 1, 1992. Entities added to the eligibility list at a later date may only request discounts
retroactive to the date of their inclusion on the list. Of the entities listed on the eligibility list, only the following
may request these discounts: The covered entity that_(1) has billed for covered outpatient drugs using an all-inclusive
rate (either per visit or per encounter), or (2) has not billed Medicaid for covered outpatient drugs since December
1, 1992, (or since its inclusion on the eligibility list), or (3) has submitted its Medicaid provider number and is
requesting refunds for subsequent periods, or (4) has adequate documentation proving that drugs for which a retroactive
discount is being requested have not generated Medicaid rebates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A DSH is not eligible for retroactive discounts for covered outpatient drugs purchased through a group purchasing
organization (GPO) or any group purchasing arrangement. Any DSH outpatient clinic which is or will be eligible for
retroactive discounts may preserve its rights by sending manufacturers a letter requesting such refunds and providing
adequate documentation of purchases.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Entity Guidelines Regarding Drug Diversion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Covered entities are required not to resell or otherwise transfer outpatient drugs purchased at the statutory discount
to an individual who is not a patient of the entity. There are several common situations in which this might occur. First,
if individuals other than patients of the covered entity obtain covered outpatient drugs from its pharmaceutical
dispensing facility, the entity must develop and institute adequate safeguards to prevent the transfer of discounted
outpatient drugs to individuals who are not eligible for the discount (e.g., separate purchasing accounts and dispensing
records). Second, a larger institution which contains an eligible entity within its structure is required to establish
separate purchasing accounts and maintain separate dispensing records for the eligible entity. Third, the covered
entity itself may not use the covered outpatient drug in excluded services (e.g., inpatient services). If an entity
offers services excluded from the drug discount program, the entity must develop a separate method for purchasing
and dispensing drugs for excluded services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The covered entity may, at its option, develop an alternative system, short of tracking each discounted drug through
the purchasing and dispensing process, by which it can prove compliance. If an alternate system of tracking is proposed
to be used, this system must be approved by the Drug Pricing Program. The Office will develop criteria for alternative
systems at a later date and welcomes all suggestions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Audit Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All entities receiving statutory prices are required to maintain records of purchases of covered outpatient drugs
and of any claims for reimbursement submitted for such drugs under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The entity
must permit HHS and the manufacturer to audit any record of a covered drug purchase that was subject to the discount,
as provided by section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHS Act. Manufacturer audits will be conducted in accordance with procedures
developed by the Secretary of HHS. The Office of Drug Pricing is developing proposed audit guidelines which will be
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with public comment invited. The notice will address only audits related to purchases as a covered entity; it does
not address other audit requirements related to participation in State Medicaid programs or receipt of Federal funding.

(6) Entity Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Covered entity participation in the section 340B drug discount program is voluntary. Once an entity has elected to
participate in the program, it must wait to enter or withdraw from the program until the next official updating of the
eligible entity list. The Office of Drug Pricing will update this list two weeks before each calendar quarter. The
entity must comply with all program guidelines until the date it is removed from the eligibility list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Group Purchasing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A DSH may participate in a group purchasing arrangement for inpatient drug use without affecting its eligibility
to purchase section 340B discounted drugs. If a DSH participates in a GPO or other group purchasing arrangement for
covered outpatient drugs, the DSH will no longer be an eligible covered entity and cannot purchase covered outpatient
drugs at the section 340B discount prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or other groups, which purchase drugs for covered entities (other than disproportionate share hospitals)
are not included on the list of covered entities; however, they are eligible to purchase at the section 340B discount
if the following requirements are met: (1) the group purchasing arrangement must be comprised of only covered entities,
(2) if group purchasing arrangements contain entities which are not eligible for the discount, separate purchasing
accounts and dispensing/distribution must be maintained, and (3) the purchasing group has written authority from
the covered entity to purchase covered outpatient drugs on its behalf.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(8) Purchasing Agents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A covered entity is permitted to use a purchasing agent without forfeiting its right to the section 340B drug discounts.
If a purchasing agent is used, the arrangement must be in writing and the terms of the agent's relationship with the
entity must be clearly defined. The entity and the agent should decide whether the agent simply negotiates the drug
purchasing contracts on behalf of the entity or actually receives drug shipments for distribution to the entity.
If the latter, the transfer of purchased pharmaceuticals from an agent to the entity would not be viewed as drug diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the DSH/GPO prohibition only, a purchasing agent may be distinguished from and would not be considered
operating as a GPO or other group purchasing arrangement if the following conditions are met: (1) the purchasing agent
is not associated with a GPO or other purchasing arrangement; (2) no collective bargaining by a group of hospitals
occurs; (3) the negotiations for PHS pricing are separate activities for each individual DSH; (4) a separate agreement
with each DSH is executed; (5) as part of the agreement, there will be no sharing of pricing information; and (6) all
final decisions concerning product and price acceptance will be made by each individual DSH.

(9) Definition of Covered Outpatient Drug
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1927(k)(2) of the Social Security Act defines ``covered outpatient drug'' to include most drugs and biologicals
which may be dispensed only by prescription and which require approval by the Food and Drug Administration or a license
under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 1927(k)(3) limits the definition of ``covered outpatient drug'' to exclude
certain settings (e.g., such services as emergency room, hospice, dental, physician, nursing facilities, x-ray,
lab, and renal dialysis) in some instances. In these settings, if a covered drug is included in the per diem rate (i.e.,
bundled with other payments in an all-inclusive, per visit, or an encounter rate), it will not be included in the section
340B discount program. However, if a covered drug is billed and paid for instead as a separate line item as an outpatient
drug in a cost basis billing system, this drug will be included in the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(10) Dealing Direct or Through a Wholesaler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a manufacturer has customarily dealt directly with a particular covered entity, then requiring the manufacturer
to continue this form of purchasing with the covered entity is reasonable. When dealing directly with a covered entity,
manufacturers must offer covered outpatient drugs at or below the section 340B discount prices. If a manufacturer
customarily uses a wholesaler as a means of distribution, then requiring the manufacturer to continue this form of
purchasing with covered entities is also reasonable. If the manufacturer's drugs are available to covered entities
through wholesalers, the discount must be made available through that avenue. Manufacturers may not single out covered
entities from their other customers for restrictive conditions that would undermine the statutory objective. Manufacturers
must not place limitations on the transactions (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum purchase amounts) which would have the effect of discouraging entities from participating in the discount
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(11) Manufacturer's Contracts Requiring Entity Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A manufacturer may not condition the offer of statutory discounts upon an entity's assurance of compliance with section
340B provisions. Covered entity assurances regarding the following activities may not be required: (1) eligibility
to participate in the program; (2) utilization of covered outpatient drugs only in authorized services; (3) maintaining
the confidentiality of the drug pricing information; (4) permitting the manufacturers to audit purchase, inventory,
and related records prior to the publication of approved PHS guidelines; and (5) submitting information related
to drug acquisition, purchase, and inventory systems. Entities are not required to sign agreements assuring manufacturers
of their compliance with section 340B provisions. (If a manufacturer asks a covered entity whether the entity is in
fact participating in the section 340B discount program, the entity must supply the manufacturer with this information).
This prohibition does not include provisions that address customary business practice, request standard information,
or include other appropriate contract provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to  HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A&hyph;10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443&hyph;2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to defer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable..
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1&hyph;800&hyph;927&hyph;7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Barbara
Richards at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), and the date of publication in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Region, proposes to establish a
national wildlife refuge in the vicinity of Sevier County, Arkansas. The purpose of the proposed refuge is to protect
and manage up to 30,000 acres of bottomland hardwoods and their associated fish and wildlife in southwestern Arkansas.
A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has been developed by Service biologists
in coordination with the State of Arkansas, the Sevier County Judge, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Soil Conservation
Service, and The Nature Conservancy. The assessment considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic
effects of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates four alternative actions and their potential
impacts on the environment. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal are welcomed and should
be sent to the address below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary objectives of the proposed Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge are to (1) preserve wetland and bottomland
hardwood habitat for a natural diversity of wildlife, (2) provide habitat for neotropical migratory birds, (3) provide
wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl, (4) provide breeding and nesting habitat for wood ducks, and (5) provide
opportunities for compatible public outdoor recreation, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, birdwatching, and environmental
education and interpretation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed refuge area lies in the floodplain between the Cossatot and Little Rivers in Sevier County, Arkansas.
Pond Creek and Little Creek meander through the area and several scenic oxbow lakes, lined with cypress trees, are
prominent. Beavers have created numerous small ponds and flooded depressions. The habitat is primarily bottomland
hardwoods with scattered pines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 25,722 acres or 85 percent of the proposed refuge area is owned by the Weyerhaeuser Corporation and has been offered
for sale or exchange to the Service. Weyerhaeuser has extensive land holdings in Arkansas and Oklahoma which are being
managed for the production of pine timber. The proposed refuge area is primarily a low bottomland hardwood site that
Weyerhaeuser has determined to be surplus to its future management needs. The remaining lands (approximately 4,300
acres) within the proposed refuge boundary are owned by about 30 private landowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to acquire these lands through fee title purchases and/or land exchanges. Acquisition of these
lands would be pursued under the authority of the Emergency Wetland Resources Act of 1986, unless special legislation
is provided to facilitate the possible exchange of lands between the Weyerhaeuser Corporation and the Federal government.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed action is to identify and implement a strategy for Service habitat protection activities
in support of the Pacific Coast Joint Venture (Joint Venture) though the year 2010.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Joint Venture is a nonfederal coalition of private groups and government agencies that strives to coordinate
efforts to protect and maintain important wetlands and related habitats on the Pacific Coast of North America, from
northern California to northern British Columbia. Its efforts are directed toward supporting the waterfowl management
goals of the North American Plan, maintenance of biological diversity, protection of endangered and otherwise sensitive
wildlife, and maintenance and enhancement of anadromous fish and other native fish and shellfish populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to support the goals of the Joint Venture by ensuring increased habitat protection at selected
target areas identified in the Pacific Coast Joint Venture Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan). Such protection could
take the form of easements, leases, cooperative agreements, or fee title purchases from willing sellers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loss and degradation of estuarine and freshwater and wetland habitats have contributed significantly to decline
in populations of many of the region's wildlife species. In some areas, development has eliminated thousands of hectares
of tidal wetlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EIS will explore a range of alternative methods for protecting wildlife habitat within the Joint Venture. Some
of the possible alternatives could emphasize cooperative efforts in which most lands remain in private ownership,
other alternatives may recommend fee title land acquisition from willing sellers and the establishment of new units
of the National Wildlife Refuge System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternatives examined in the EIS will be limited to the habitat protection activities of the Service. The activities
of other Joint Venture partners will not be considered, since they are not Federal actions or contain Federal actions
(such as grants or permits) that cannot be controlled or adequately foreseen by the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions under consideration are limited to those areas identified in the Strategic Plan and do not consider possible
actions beyond the year 2010.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EIS will focus on the methods of habitat protection. The scope and timing of possible future site specific operational
planning efforts cannot be predicted at this time since it depends on which protection methods are used, the willingness
of landowners to participate, and the availability of funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant issues identified for review include: natural resource impacts, recreation and public use impacts,
agricultural industry impacts, forest industry impacts, fishing industry impacts, and other socioeconomic impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service urges all interested parties to provide comments regarding this proposed scope for the EIS, the alternatives
to be developed, and the potential significant environmental impacts which may occur from the implementation of
alternative actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C., et seq.), Council for Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing
NEPA (40 CFR part 1500, et seq.), and other appropriate Federal regulations and Service policies for compliance with
those regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with section 202 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Land Management (BLM), with the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, has prepared
a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Rangeland Reform '94. BLM and the Forest Service are proposing to
change policies and regulations within their Federal rangeland management programs. These actions are intended
to improve and restore a significant portion of rangeland ecosystems and to improve and maintain biodiversity, while
providing for sustainable development on lands administered by the two agencies. The two agencies are also proposing
to revise the formula used to determine fees charged for grazing livestock on Federal lands in the 17 western states.
By this notice, the public is informed that the draft EIS is available and that interested individuals may obtain copies
by request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The last major revisions to 43 CFR part 4100, including establishment of the current fee formula in regulations, occurred
in 1988. Since then, new information on range practices and conditions has been generated by various studies and General
Accounting Office audits. In response, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have initiated a proposal
for rangeland reform, including specific regulatory language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft EIS addresses several areas of rangeland management reform, including, but not limited to: the Federal
formula for calculating grazing fees, subleasing, unauthorized use (trespass), public participation, suspended
and extended nonuse, appeals, disqualification, issuing grazing preference and permits, prohibited acts, permit
or lease tenure, BLM grazing advisory boards, range improvement ownership, establishment of an ecosystem framework
for rangeland management, and the establishment of standards and guidelines for grazing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EIS is a national-level, programmatic EIS. It documents the ecological, economic, and social impacts that
would result from alternative fee formulas and from reforming, or not reforming, other elements of the federal rangeland
management program. Five management alternatives are considered in detail: Current Management (No Action), BLM-Forest
Service Proposed Action, Livestock Production, Environmental Enhancement, and No Grazing. Seven grazing fee formula
alternatives are also analyzed: Current Public Rangeland Improvement Act (PRIA) (No Action), Modified PRIA, BLM-Forest
Service Proposed Action, Regional Fees, Federal Forage Fee, PRIA with Surcharges, and Competitive Bidding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Alternative 1, Current Management (No Action) would continue existing policies, regulations, and management
practices within both BLM's and the Forest Service's rangeland management programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Alternative 2, the BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action, would change many elements of the agencies' current
rangeland policies, regulations, and management practices. The Proposed Action includes national requirements
that provide the basis for developing state or regional standards and guidelines for managing livestock grazing
in rangeland ecosystems administered by BLM. The Forest Service would continue to formulate standards and guidelines
for rangeland management while it prepares national forest land and resource management plans. BLM would replace
grazing advisory boards with resource advisory councils, which would address a broader range of concerns, while
still ensuring local participation in rangeland management decisions. Both agencies would implement policies
to manage rangeland resources using an ecosystem approach. The Proposed Action would also establish consistent
BLM and Forest Service programs to improve ecological conditions while maintaining opportunities for long-term
sustainable development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Alternative 3, Livestock Production, would place more control of rangeland management in local communities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although BLM and the Forest Service would not give up their responsibilities under laws and regulations, local community
involvement in grazing advisory boards would play a lead role in making decisions about public rangelands management
planning, implementation, and evaluation. Under this alternative, both agencies would have grazing advisory boards.
BLM standards and guidelines would be developed at the local level by grazing advisory boards, while the Forest Service
would continue to formulate standards and guidelines when it prepares national forest land and resource management
plans. Goals and objectives for rangeland ecosystems would be set at the local level through consultation with grazing
advisory boards. As under other alternatives, regulation changes would make BLM and Forest Service program administration
more efficient and consistent.

Management Alternative 4, Environmental Enhancement, would authorize livestock grazing only in areas where enough
data shows resource condition standards and goals are being met. This alternative places greater emphasis on managing
all uses, including livestock grazing, to sustain ecosystem biodiversity and ecological processes. Some areas
would be closed to grazing: wilderness, designated critical habitat for threatened and endangered species, developed
recreation sites, and areas of unacceptable rangeland health. Under this alternative, BLM and the Forest Service
would adopt and implement national standards and guidelines aimed at maintaining ecosystem health. Joint BLM-Forest
Service advisory councils would be set up on an ecoregion basis. As under other alternatives, regulation changes
would make BLM and Forest Service program administration more efficient and consistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Alternative 5, No Grazing, would eliminate grazing on public lands over a 3-year phase-out period. BLM
and the Forest Service would continue developing policies and procedures for promoting ecosystem management. Where
needed, the agencies could use livestock to manage vegetation to achieve resource objectives. None of the other livestock
grazing management measures considered in the other four alternatives would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fee Alternative 1, Current PRIA (No Action), consists of a base value of $1.23 per animal unit month (AUM) that is updated
annually using three indexes: change in forage value, change in beef cattle prices, and prices paid for selected items
purchased by permittees. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fee Alternative 2, Modified PRIA, would use the same base as PRIA, $1.23, but would differ in using an index for all production
costs rather than selected production costs. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged
in the previous year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fee Alternative 3, BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action, would adopt a fee formula using a base value ($3.96) updated
annually by a Forage Value Index. The $3.96 base value represents a midrange between the results obtained through
the use of two methods for estimating a fair base value. The proposed fee would be phased in over the years 1995 through
1997. Thereafter, annual increases or decreases in the grazing fee resulting from changes in the forage value index
would be limited to 25 percent of the amount charged the previous year to provide for a measure of stability that would
facilitate business planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would establish 1996 as the base year for the forage value index. The forage value index would not be used
to annually adjust the fee in response to market conditions until the year 1997. This proposed rule would establish
the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter the fee would be calculated, using the base
value of $3.96 multiplied by the revised forage value index. By definition, the forage value index in the year 1997
would equal one; yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent years the calculated fee would depend on the changes
in the market rate for private grazing land leases as reflected by the forage value index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fee incentive criteria would be developed during the first 2 years of a 3-year fee phase-in period. The third year of
the phase-in would not be implemented until the incentive criteria are developed. Instead a base value of $3.50 would
be substituted in 1997. Fee Alternative 4, Regional Fees, is the same as the proposed action fee, except that a different
base value would be applied to six pricing regions. The regional base values would be derived from the 1983 Federal
Land Forage Appraisal (updated in 1992). The regional base values would be annually updated using the Forage Value
Index. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fee Alternative 5, Federal Forage Fee Formula, was developed by the Western Livestock Producers Alliance. It is based
on a 3-year average of private grazing land lease rates for 16 western states. The formula uses multipliers of private
land lease rates and deducts the updated 1966 nonfee costs described in the proposed fee alternative. That amount
is multiplied by the percentage difference of cash receipts per cow for federal and nonfederal livestock producers.
The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fee Alternative 6, PRIA with Surcharges, would use the fee under the PRIA fee alternative ($1.86 for 1993) and add a
surcharge to cover the cost of administering the grazing program at the local Forest Service and BLM administrative
level. Each year the fee would be limited to twice the fee produced by the PRIA formula. After a 1-year phase-in, the
surcharge would not differ by more than 10 percent from the previous year's surcharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fee Alternative 7, Competitive Bidding System, would use competitive bidding to set grazing fees. The successful
bidder would be required to adhere to the terms of the permit and perform specific management practices and facilities
maintenance. The terms of the permit would be part of the bid process, allowing bidders themselves to estimate the
market value of the forage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 3406(c)(1) of the CVPIA, an EIS will be prepared which will evaluate the environmental effects
of the alternative ways of implementing the measures developed in the CP. The CP will address fish, wildlife, and habitat
concerns on the San Joaquin River including but not limited to the improvements that would be needed to reestablish
where necessary and sustain naturally reproducing anadromous fisheries from Friant Dam to its confluence with the
San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. It will be developed in cooperation with the California
Department of Fish and Game and in coordination with the San Joaquin River Management Program under development by
the State of California. It will incorporate, among other relevant factors, the potential contributions of tributary
streams as well as the alternatives being investigated in the course of preparing the Stanislaus River Basin and Calaveras
River Water Use Program EIA/Environmental Impact Report, currently underway pursuant to CVPIA section 3406(c)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternatives will be developed during the scoping and planning process and will be evaluated in the environmental
documentation. The range of alternatives will include No Action. The CP and draft EIS are expected to be completed
and available for review and comment early in 1996. The data generated pursuant to other CVPIA activities may be used
in the development of the CP and EIS. The data developed and analyzed in the CP and EIS may be used in the Friant Water Contract
Renewal process pursuant to CVPIA section 3404(c)(1) at some future date.

 The rate bureaus all seek to expand from their present regional ratemaking authority to nationwide authority. These
requests raise common issues, and we will consolidate them. We seek public comments on them, which may be filed on any
individual amendment or collectively as to all the amendments. If we receive additional applications, we anticipate
consolidating them with this proceeding. By this notice we are vacating the schedules published at 59 FR 18416 (April
18, 1994) and 59 FR 22683 (May 2, 1994) for filing public comments on EC&hyph;MAC Motor Carriers Service Association,
Inc.'s and Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau, Inc.'s applications, respectively, for approval to amend their ratemaking
agreements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Canadian Pacific Limited has filed an application with the Commission seeking authority to discontinue and abandon
all freight and passenger rail operations over 201.2 miles of rail line between Skinner and Vanceboro (The Skinner-Vanceboro
Line) in the Maine counties of Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Aroostook, and Washington. The proposed
abandonment activities would include the discontinuance of rail service over the entire line; the diversion of traffic
to motor carriers or other railroads; and the salvage of all rails, ties, railroad-related appurtenances, and standing
structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that if the Commission approves the abandonment, this action would constitute a major Federal action having
the potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, we will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS). A notice of intent to prepare an EIS and to hold public scoping meetings for this proceeding
was published on February 22, 1994. The notice requested comments in writing or orally at public scoping meetings
that were held in Woodland, Maine and Bangor, Maine on March 15 and March 16, 1994, respectively. Over 50 parties provided
comment and/or attended the scoping meetings. In accordance with the Commission's environmental rules at 49 CFR
1105, the final scope of study is summarized below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY OF THE SCOPE OF STUDY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Abandonment and salvage activities may significantly affect the environment in the project area. Based on the comments
and our initial evaluation, the proposed abandonment may result in a number of environmental impacts. These impacts
include:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We want to make it clear here that the EIS will only analyze the environmental effects that relate to this abandonment
proposal. The environmental review process is not the proper forum for analyzing the ``need'' for or the economic
merits of a proposed project. It is through the development of a separate evidentiary record that addresses the merits
of the proposed abandonment that the Commission considers issues of economic impact and the impacts to rural and community
development as required by 49 U.S.C. 10903 (a) (2).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Charles City Railway Lines, Inc. (CCRY), was shut down by its management effective with the close of business February
24, 1994, due to a lack of operating funds. There are two principal shippers located on the 3.6-mile CCRY line. On March
4, 1994, the Commission issued Directed Service Order No. 1515, authorizing the Cedar River Railroad Company (CRR)
to operate the CCRY lines for 60 days under certain terms and conditions contained in that order. The Commission was
notified on May 4, 1994, of CRR's willingness to continue that operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the need for continued rail service over CCRY's lines and CRR's willingness to provide directed service
without compensation from the Federal government, this decision grants an extension of the interim service authority
to CRR for 180 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1992, the Arkansas Midland Railroad Company (AMR) acquired four unconnected rail lines totalling 131 miles from
the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP). Each of the branch lines acquired by AMR extends from the same North/South
UP line in central Arkansas. On one of the branch lines, the Norman Branch, there are five active shippers (International
Paper Company, Gifford-Hill &amp; Company, Barksdale Lumber Company, Bean Lumber Company, and G&amp;S Roofing
Products Company, Inc.), and one inactive shipper (Cargill). The Norman Branch extends approximately 52.9 miles
from its connection with UP at Gurdon, AR, to the end of the line at Birds Mill, AR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 15, 1993, the AMR embargoed 31 miles of the Norman Branch line from Pikes Junction to Birds Mill as a result
of storm damage. This embargo affected Barksdale Lumber, Bean Lumber, and G&amp;S Roofing. On February 22, 1994,
AMR embargoed approximately 17 additional miles of the line, which affected service to Gifford Hill &amp; Company
located at Delight, AR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1994, the Commission issued Service Order No. 1516 for 30 days pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11123 (a), authorizing
the Dardanelle &amp; Russellville Railroad Company (DRRC) and its newly formed non-carrier subsidiary, the Caddo,
Antoine, Little Missouri Railroad Company (CALM) to operate approximately 49 miles of the AMR Norman Branch line
currently under embargo. The Order also authorized DRRC/CALM to utilize trackage rights over approximately 3 miles
of the remaining portion of the Norman Branch, which AMR continues to operate, in order to reach a connection with the
Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 There continues to be an immediate need for rail service over the AMR's Norman Branch, especially considering the
urgency of aggregate shipments to the State of Louisiana for a highway construction project and the service needs
of other shippers. AMR has indicated that it is willing to allow continued operations by DRRC/CALM over the Norman
Branch line under the Terms and Conditions contained herein. DRRC/CALM has expressed a willingness to rehabilitate
the line to the extent necessary and to provide service to shippers and to continue its operations. AMR and DRRC/CALM
have agreed amongst themselves as to the terms of the trackage rights arrangement. Based upon these circumstances
and the statutory requirements, an emergency service order under 49 U.S.C. 11123 continues to be appropriate, and
is responsive to the shippers' service needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the need for continued rail service over AMR's Norman Branch, and DRRC/CALM's willingness to provide this
service and limited track rehabilitation, this decision grants the requests of interested parties for interim service
authority to DRRC/CALM on the Terms and Conditions noted below for a period of 180 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emergency nature of the situation compels us to conclude that advance public notice and hearings would be impractical
and contrary to the immediate public interest, and that the modified hearing procedure conducted during the order's
initial 30-day term satisfied the statutory hearing requirement at 49 U.S.C. 11123(a)(2). Accordingly, we exercise
our authority under 49 U.S.C. 11123(a)(1) to waive further advance public notice in the present circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Compensate AMR for the 3-mile overhead trackage rights required to effect interchange with the UP at Gurdon, AR,

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No further compensation during the extended period of this order is contemplated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above, operations by DRRC/CALM may continue on the terms and conditions described herein and
upon notice to the Commission by DRRC/CALM that conditions continue to exist which allow safe operations over pertinent
portions of the Norman Branch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In operating AMR's line, DRRC/CALM shall use its own cars and operating equipment, or cars of other AMR connections
as agreed to by those connections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In providing service under this service order, DRRC/CALM shall comply with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11123(a)(3)
with respect to AMR employees required for this operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rates and charges shall be those applicable to the line and in effect at the time DRRC/CALM commenced operations. DRRC/CALM
shall not seek changes in AMR rates and charges during the initial period of this order. All revenues from such charges
shall accrue to the account of DRRC/CALM during the effective period of this order, and shall not constitute assets
of AMR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any rehabilitation, operational, or other costs related to the authorized operations shall be the sole responsibility
and liability of DRRC/CALM. Any such costs or expenditures shall not be deemed an obligation or liability of the United
States Government. DRRC/CALM shall hold the United States Government harmless from any claim arising out of the authorized
operations.

Any operational difficulties associated with the authorized operations shall be resolved by DRRC/CALM and any other
affected party through negotiated agreement, or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, by the Commission. Any initiation
of operations by any entity other than DRRC/CALM over the AMR lines shall occur only after approval by the Commission
and upon 30-days' notice to the Commission and AMR. This 30-day transition period would apply also to operation commenced
pursuant to the Commission's approval of Finance Docket No. 32479.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We find: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. DRRC/CALM has requested the Commission to permit it to provide continued rail service over those portions of the
AMR lines included in the Norman Branch which it determines to be operationally safe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To prevent transportation and economic disruptions in this area of Arkansas, and to assure the immediate continued
movement of critically needed commodities to adjoining regions of the United States including Louisiana, it is necessary
for the Commission to authorize DRRC/CALM to operate over AMR's Norman Branch line including 3 miles of overhead trackage
under 49 U.S.C. 11123, conditioned upon a waiver of any compensation from the Federal government and DRRC/CALM's
agreement to hold the United States Government and AMR harmless from any claim arising out of the authorized operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is ordered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Based upon its undertaking to do so upon the terms and conditions noted herein, DRRC/CALM is authorized under 49
U.S.C. 11123 to enter upon and operate AMR's Norman Branch including 3 miles of overhead trackage rights pursuant
to the terms of this service order and its agreements with AMR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Operations by DRRC/CALM on the lines of AMR authorized in this decision may continue provided it gives appropriate
notification to the Commission that the lines to be operated remain safe for that operation. Operations by DRRC may
continue for 180 days from the effective date of this decision unless it is sooner modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operations performed under authority of this order shall conform to the directions and conditions prescribed
herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. All submissions filed in this proceeding should refer to Service Order No. 1516 and should be sent to the Commission's

In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of Halliburton Geophysical Services,
Inc., headquartered in Houston, Texas and operating at various other locations. The notice was issued on October
23, 1992 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification notice was amended on April 18, 1994. The amended notice was published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification again for workers of the subject firm.
Halliburton restructured their organization which caused Halliburton Geophysical Services, Inc. to be known as

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to show the correct name of the worker group.

In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. app. 2 (1972), and 29 CFR 102.136
(1993), and after consulting with and obtaining the approval of the Committee Management Secretariat of the General
Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget, the National Labor Relations Board has determined
that the establishment of a National Labor Relations Board Advisory Committee on Agency Procedure is necessary and
in the public interest. Except as hereinafter noted and until further notice, the Agency adopts and will follow the
Federal Advisory Committee Management Regulations for the operation of this and future advisory committees (41
CFR 101&hyph;6.1001_101.61035 (1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Committee is to provide input and advice to the Board and General Counsel on changes in Agency procedures
that will expedite case processing and improve Agency service to the public. The Committee will function solely as
an advisory body and in compliance with the terms of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and its charter will be filed
in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee will consist of 50 members divided into two panels, one composed of 25 Union-side representatives and
the other of 25 Management-side representatives. Membership on the panels will be broadly representative of persons
who represent labor and management before the Agency, and members will be selected for their expertise in representing
labor and management before the Agency. Balance of Committee composition will be ensured through geographical,
ethnic minority and women representatives, and through representation by the Co-Chairs of the NLRB Practice and
Procedure Committee of the Labor and Employment Law Section of the American Bar Association. Appointments will be
for two years unless otherwise directed by the Chairman of the Board. Committee members will be required to bear their
own costs for travel and other expenses in connection with their participation on the Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the two panels of the Committee will meet separately. The date, place and time of the panel meetings will
be published in the Federal Register. The notice will also announce whether the meetings are open or closed to public
attendance, and if closed, the reasons why. A session of the Committee will consist of one scheduled meeting of each
panel. When the panels meet on different dates, the adjournment of the latter of the two panels will constitute an adjournment
of that session of the Committee. Within 30 days of that adjournment, any member of the public may present written comments
to the Committee on the matters considered during the previous session.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of no Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR&hyph;53 and DPR&hyph;69, issued to Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the licensee) for operation
of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise Figure 5.1&hyph;1, Site Boundary Map, and Figure 5.1&hyph;2, Low Population
Zone Map, in the Technical Specifications (TSs). The revisions are needed to correct the discrepancy between the
current site property lines and the property lines as shown on TS Figure 5.1&hyph;1 and Figure 5.1&hyph;2. This discrepancy
resulted from the purchase of land subsequent to issuance of the plant operating licenses and the failure to update
the TSs to reflect the change in site property lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated September 29, 1992, as supplemented
by letters dated October 22, 1993, and November 11, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to the TSs are required to correct the discrepancy between the current site property lines and
the property lines as shown on Figure 5.1&hyph;1 and Figure 5.1&hyph;2 in the TSs. This discrepancy resulted from
the purchase of six parcels of land subsequent to issuance of the plant operating licenses and the failure to update
the TSs to reflect the change in property lines. The original site covered 1135 acres. With the addition of the six new
parcels of land, the site now covers 2108 acres.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 2108 acre Calvert Cliffs site includes forest and farmland which surround the plant. The land's primary purpose
is to serve as a natural buffer between the plant and the local community. Over 1500 acres of the site are covered with
woodlands. The remaining acreage is made up of various open areas, a 50-acre recreational facility, and a working
farm of about 100 acres. The six parcels of land that were acquired by the licensee subsequent to issuance of the plant
operating licenses are comprised of shoreline property, woodlands, and farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to TS Figure 5.1&hyph;1 and Figure 5.1&hyph;2 are administrative in nature in that they will
update the TSs to accurately reflect the current site boundary. The proposed amendments will not change plant equipment,
operation or procedures, and do not adversely affect the probability or the consequences of any accident at this facility.
The proposed amendments also do not affect radiological effluents from the facility or the radiation levels at the
facility. Although the exclusion area as defined in 10 CFR part 100 has been increased, the property addition does
not change the licensee's offsite dose calculations. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological impacts associated with the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no persons who reside on any of the new parcels and the acquired property does not contain sites of historical,
archaeological or scenic significance. The licensee's Land Management Program implements certain forestry and
farming practices that are intended to preserve the site's land resources and natural habitats. There are three focal
areas of the program; fire prevention, significant laws and regulations, and wildlife considerations. Salient
aspects of these focal areas are summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the area of fire prevention, the licensee has implemented a program to replace large stands of Virginia Pine trees
with better quality trees to reduce the potential for fire. A system of fire roads has also been developed throughout
the property and firefighting equipment has been strategically placed along these roads to assist personnel in the
event of a fire. A property grid system has been established to determine the location and extent of a fire once discovered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to significant laws and regulations, environmental laws in the State of Maryland are focused on promoting
good soil conservation practices, improving the quality of the Chesapeake Bay, and preserving endangered species
and other animals unique to the area. To avoid erosion and keep land productive, the licensee uses practices such as
contour plowing, applying pesticides and fertilizer properly, rotating crops, minimizing tilling, and growing
a cover crop during the winter for all farming operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chesapeake Bay Critical Areas Law strictly governs the use of land within 100 feet of, and all tributaries leading
into, the Chesapeake Bay. The law was enacted to prevent the continued deterioration of the Bay by controlling future
development and water runoff containing harmful quantities of sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, and toxic metals
from agricultural fields and other developed land adjacent to the Bay. The licensee complies with Calvert County's
Critical Area Plan. Four of the new parcels of land have land which falls in the critical area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Calvert Cliffs site is regulated by the Federal ``Endangered Species Act,'' 16 U.S.C. 1531. This act requires
landowners to preserve those areas inhabited by species protected by this act. At Calvert Cliffs, the Tiger Beetle
and Bald Eagle are protected. Two species of the Tiger Beetle are found along the beach area at Calvert Cliffs; the Northeastern
Beach Tiger Beetle and the Puritan Tiger Beetle. A family of Bald Eagles is located in the southern portion of the Calvert
Cliffs site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Calvert Cliffs site is home for a wide variety of wildlife, including two animal species considered endangered.
Their habitat is largely preserved on more than three-fourths of the 2108 acres at Calvert Cliffs. By implementing
sound forestry practices the licensee endeavors to ensure that the necessary food, nesting areas, and cover are provided
to support the animals that live at Calvert Cliffs. The licensee has several plans in place to ensure that the habitats
of the various wildlife species are preserved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the TSs will merely update the TSs to reflect the current site boundary and will not affect
the utilization of the six new parcels of land or implementation of the licensee's Land Management Program. The proposed
amendments will also not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed amendments.

Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
would be to deny the requested amendments. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.

<DOCTITLE>Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J. Paragraph III.D.3, Type C tests, to the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.
(the licensee), for the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, located in Westchester County, New York.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee would be exempt from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J. Paragraph III.D.3, to the extent that
an extension would be allowed for performing Type C leak rate tests on containment isolation valves. These leak rate
tests are currently required to be performed at intervals no greater than 2 years. The exemption would allow Type C
leak rate tests to be performed at intervals no greater than 30 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated January 28, 1994, the licensee requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TSs) and an
exemption from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) requirements to allow Type C leak rate tests to be performed at
intervals no greater than 30 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles, starting
with fuel cycle 12. Fuel cycle 12 started in April 1993. The requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3,
indicate the Type C leak rate tests must be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling at intervals no greater
than 2 years (24 months). In order to conform with this regulation, the licensee could be required to shutdown Indian
Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2 and enter a forced outage prior to the next refueling outage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff had previously recognized that certain regulations would not accommodate fuel cycles longer than 18
months. Consequently, the NRC staff issued Generic Letter (GL) 91&hyph;04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.'' This GL provides guidance to licensees on how to prepare
requests for TS amendments and regulation exemptions which are needed to accommodate 24-month fuel cycles. The licensee's
letter of January 28, 1994, followed the guidance of GL 91&hyph;04.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of accidents previously analyzed and the
proposed exemption does not affect facility radiation levels or facility radiological effluents. The requested
exemption is based, in part, on increasing the margin to the allowed combined leakage limit for Type B and C tests by
25 percent. In addition, the licensee has reviewed the results of previous leak rate tests performed at Indian Point
Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, and provided a basis for concluding that containment leakage will be maintained within
acceptable limits with a maximum test interval of 30 months. The NRC staff has determined that the licensee's submittal
is consistent with the guidance provided in GL 91&hyph;04. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no
significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves leak rate tests on containment
isolation valves. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that there is no significant nonradiological environmental impact associated with the
proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the
proposed exemption, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal
alternative would be to deny the licensee's request for exemption. Such action would not reduce the environmental
impacts of plant operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternate Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statements
Related to the Operation of Indian Point Nuclear Generating Plant Unit No. 2,'' dated September 1972.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's submittal that supports the proposed exemption discussed above. The NRC staff
consulted with the State of New York regarding the environmental impact of the proposed exemption. The State of New
York had no comments regarding this proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the exemption under consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for exemption dated January 28, 1994,
which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10610.

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NFP&hyph;21 issued to Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of the Nuclear
Project No. 2 (WNP&hyph;2) plant, located in Benton County, Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would (1) revise TS 3/4.4.2 and 3/4.5.1 to require main stream system and automatic depressurization
system safety/relief valve (SRV) surveillance testing within 12 hours after steam pressure and flow are adequate
to do the testing; and (2) revise TS Table 4.3.7.5&hyph;1 to require SRV position indicator surveillance testing
within 12 hours after steam pressure and flow are adequate to do the testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the change is to clarify when the 12-hour time period begins. The licensee is also making a change to the
TS SRV basis to clarify that testing SRVs at low power means testing them when there is adequate steam pressure and flow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Supply System has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standards as required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and
concluded that the change does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential delay in confirming safety relief valve (SRV), SRV position indication (acoustic monitor, valve stem
position indicators, and tailpipe temperature instruments), and ADS operability during plant startup should not
result in any change to the expected satisfactory completion of the required surveillance tests. Surveillance testing
that is conducted during the plant shutdown sequence, and during shutdown, provides reasonable assurance that the
SRVs will function when required. Under the proposed change, plant test conditions would not be different than in
the past since testing was not begun until adequate pressure for the duration of the test was achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve a design change nor do they involve changes outside the scope of the existing test
requirements. No new failure modes are introduced as a result of the proposed changes. The acoustic monitors merely
provide indication that an SRV is open. They do not provide an actuation signal. Alternate mechanisms of SRV position
indication exist, i.e., reactor water level changes, reactor pressure changes, main turbine bypass valve position,
SRV tail pipe temperature, suppression pool level, and suppression pool temperature. The time delay prior to operability
verification will not affect Technical Specification requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes have no impact on the operability or performance requirements of the SRVs, including the ADS
function, as they do not change the lift setpoints or minimum number of valves required to be operable. The effect of
delaying the starting point of the time clock is not expected to affect completion of the required tests. ADS/SRV position
indication availability will not be significantly affected by the proposed change since the additional 48 hours
per refueling cycle of not verifying SRV, SRV position indication, and ADS SRV operability occurs at low power with
the High Pressure Core Spray and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling systems available. Additionally, there is a high
probability that the SRVs would perform their intended function if required even though they have not been declared
operable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10
CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no
significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission
will not issue the amendment until the 30-day notice period expires. However, should circumstances change during
the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility,
the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its
final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination
will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish a notice
of issuance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action
will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By June 13, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license, and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Richland Public Library, 955 Northgate Street, Richland,
Washington 99352. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;800&hyph;248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;800&hyph;342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Theodore R. Quay, Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;3: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to M. H. Phillips, Jr., Esq., Winston &amp; Strawn, 1400 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;3502,
the licensee's attorney.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on April 13, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items
have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change consists of procedures for electronic mail features and for the interactive use of DTC's
enhanced Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system.

The enhanced ID system concept was approved in an earlier Commission order. The order specified that each individual
feature of the enhanced ID system would be the subject of a separate filing under section 19(b)(1) of the Act. Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 33466 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3139 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;07] (order approving
concept of enhanced ID system).

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of
the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will enable ID system users to use the ID system interactively with the capability of accomplishing
all ID system processing within a single business day. ID system users will have the option to continue to use the ID
system in a batch mode.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also seeks to implement two electronic mail features. These features will enable ID system users to send
and receive ``notification of order execution'' and ``institution instruction'' messages. A notification of order
execution can be sent by a broker-dealer to communicate the details of an order execution to an institution. If the
institution accepts the notification of order execution, the institution can send the broker-dealer an institution
instruction containing information, such as the allocation of block trades, which is needed by the broker-dealer
to enter trade data into the ID system for the preparation of confirmations. Currently, broker-dealers and institutions
make telephone calls or send facsimile transmissions to communicate this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder because the proposed rule change will further automate the process by which securities transactions
are cleared and settle and thereby will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. The proposal also is consistent with section 17A in that because the proposed rule change enhances
DTC's existing ID system it will be implemented consistently with the safeguarding of securities and funds in DTC's
custody or control or for which DTC is responsible.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interactive capability and electronic mail features have been developed through widespread consultations
with securities industry members. Written comments from DTC participants or others have not been solicited on the
proposed rule change.

DTC requests accelerated effectiveness for the proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act so that
the proposed rule change can be implemented as soon as possible. Recently, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1
under the Act which, effective June 1, 1995, establishes three business days as the standard settlement timeframe
for broker-dealers.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change, particularly the interactive capability of the ID system, will facilitate three business
day settlement. Accelerated effectiveness of the proposed rule change will enable ID system users to become accustomed
to the ID system well in advance of conversion to a three business day settlement cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE proposes to amend its rules relating to the capital requirements for specialists. The proposal states that
if an Exchange specialist firm is subject to the Aggregate Indebtedness Requirement Under Rule 15c3&hyph;1,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 such firm must maintain a minimum net capital of not less than $200,000.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal establishes a lesser minimum net capital requirement for broker-dealers in specialist posts that are
backed by more than one broker-dealer. Finally, the Exchange is proposing to amend its rules in response to recent
amendments adopted by the Commission to its net capital rules for Exchange specialists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to recent amendments to Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;1,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 on April 1, 1994, the Exchange's equity specialists became subject to the Commission's net capital rule.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Exchange is proposing to amend its rules to reflect the elimination of exemption from that Rule.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange is also proposing to establish an additional requirement that its equity specialist firms that are subject
to the Aggregate Indebtedness Requirement under Rule 15c3&hyph;1 must maintain a minimum net capital of $200,000.
Equity specialist firms subject to the Alternative Net Capital Requirement would be required to comply with subsection
(a)(1)(ii) of Rule 15c3&hyph;1.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange is also proposing further amendments to clarify these new requirements and to establish related procedures
for specialist firms whose net capital falls below certain levels. The Exchange believes that the proposed amendments
are appropriate to assure that the customers and creditors of its equity specialists are protected from monetary
losses and delays in the event of a specialist's failure.

 The Exchange is proposing to amend PSE Rule 1.8(a), which currently identifies the following members as exempt from
the Exchange's net capital rule: any floor broker, market maker in listed options, or specialist, registered with
the Exchange in any such capacity, who is exempt from the minimum net capital requirements prescribed by Rule 2.1 (Capital
Requirements). The Exchange is proposing to delete ``specialists'' from this list and to add ``lead market makers
in listed options'' to the list.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 This amendment is intended to make the Exchange's rules conform to the recent amendments to the Commission's net capital
rule.

In the Commission's release adopting amendments to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 (the net capital rule), the Commission stated
that it does not believe that it is necessary to apply the net capital rule to options market makers because, on an individual
basis, they are not as integral to the proper functioning of the markets in their securities. The release further states
that specialists other than options market makers perform several functions that options market makers do not, including
the maintenance of a specialist's book containing a listing of all orders away from the current market price and the
dissemination of accurate quotations in their speciality securities. Moreover, the exchanges that use options
specialists look to a single specialist or specialist unit to handle all trade whereas options market makers compete
with other market makers. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737,

 note 7. Options lead market makers on the Exchange floor compete with other market makers for orders and do not maintain
a specialist book containing a list of all orders away from the current market price. Accordingly, the Exchange believes
that options lead market makers should be treated as options market makers that are exempt from Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;1
and therefore, have been exempted from the Exchange capital regulations.

 The Exchange is proposing to adopt a rule that, notwithstanding the requirements of the Commission's net capital
rule, would require each of its specialist firms that are subject to the Aggregate Indebtedness Requirement of Rule
15c3&hyph;1 to maintain a minimum net capital of not less than $200,000. The proposed rule further provides that if
at any time a specialist firm's net capital falls below $200,000, such firm shall promptly notify the Financial Compliance
Department of the Exchange and, in addition, such firm shall not operate as a specialist with net capital of between
$150,000 and $199,999 for more than 60 days unless such firm (a) obtains from the Vice President, Regulation, or a senior
officer of the Exchange written consent to continue to operate as a specialist; and (b) takes corrective action including,
but not limited to, actively seeking financing to correct its net capital deficiency.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 22, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide procedures
for submitting information on political contributions pursuant to rule G&hyph;37. The Board has requested accelerated
approval of the proposed rule change in order to allow for the timely submission of, and public access to, information
concerning political contributions. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons. The Commission also finds good cause for granting accelerated approval of the
proposed rule change.

In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed

On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal
securities business.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Rule G&hyph;37(e)(ii) provides that reports on contributions made and municipal securities business engaged in
during the reporting period must be submitted to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37
filing procedures, quarterly, with due dates determined by the Board. In its rule G&hyph;37 filing, the Board noted
that it was developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures to allow for public access to the information
to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The current proposed rule change establishes procedures for brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers
for filing with the Board information relating to political contributions as required by rule G&hyph;37.

 The proposal also establishes procedures for filing voluntary information relating to political contributions.

Brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, or others may voluntarily submit to the Board additional information

filing procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal requires dealers to file two copies of Form G&hyph;37, and to submit such forms within thirty (30) calendar
days after the end of each calendar quarter. These dates correspond to January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.
The Board will maintain one copy of each Form G&hyph;37 off-site for back-up purposes, and will maintain the second
copy of each Form G&hyph;37 at its Public Access Facility (``PAF'') in Virginia, where it will be available to the public
for review and photocopying.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Board also will maintain a database of reports filed by each dealer (as well as any other party voluntarily submitting
information on political contributions), so that any member of the public may telephone the Board's offices to inquire
whether a particular dealer (or other party) has submitted a report pursuant to rule G&hyph;37.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 To further enhance public access to this information, the Board will provide a list of companies that offer document
retrieval and mailing services. As the Board gains experience with rule G&hyph;37 submission procedures, and as
the informational needs of the municipal market change with regard to political contributions, the Board will seek
to expand the access and services available to the public.

In addition to the dealer's name, the information available through the database will include, among other things,
the quarterly period covered by the report and summary information on political contributions. Although rule G&hyph;37
requires dealers to report certain summary information concerning contributions, it does not require disclosure
of the names of individual municipal finance professionals or executive officer contributors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the rule G&hyph;37 procedures will result in many dealers filing forms at or about the same time, the Board believes
that it can adequately process this information in a timely manner. However, if such processing becomes unduly burdensome
for the Board, then it may consider staggering dealer submission due dates in the future. In addition, if the number
of voluntary submissions substantially increases the Board's costs of processing this information, then it may
consider charging a filing fee to cover some of the expenses associated with certain of this voluntarily submitted
information. Finally, the Board, in the future, may review the necessity for, and propriety of, charging an access
fee for the forms filed, if any, pursuant to rule G&hyph;37.

The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides
that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing,
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

dealers.

The Board has requested that the Commission find good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving

to, information concerning political contributions by allowing dealers to comply with these requirements by the
first reporting deadline of July 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the Board, and, in particular, with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) and (G) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and

engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section
15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities
dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved.

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on April 26, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD hereby files, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, for Commission authorization
to extend the operation of its Pilot Program with the Stock Exchange of Singapore Limited (``SES'') for six months.
The Pilot Program currently consists of an interchange of closing price and volume data on up to 35 Nasdaq securities
that also may be traded through the SES's facilities (collectively, ``Pilot Securities''). With the thirteen hour
time difference (twelve hours during EDT), the trading hours of the SES and NASD markets do not overlap. The end-of-day
information being exchanged under the Pilot Program may assist in the establishment of opening prices the following
business day. The Pilot Program currently involves no automated order routing or execution capabilities, and no
such capability will be established during the proposed extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission originally authorized operation of the NASD&hyph;SES Pilot Program for a two-year term
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 that was extended most recently through May 12, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Commission approval of the instant filing would permit continuation of this Pilot Program through November 12, 1994.
During this interval, no more than 35 Nasdaq issues will be included in this Pilot Program. That figure corresponds
to the number originally authorized at the inception of the Pilot Program in 1988. As noted in File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;28,
the SES information being transmitted to the NASD reflects the SES's use of an order-driven trading system (known
as the ``CLOB'').

The current authorization of the NASD&hyph;SES Pilot Program will expire on May 12, 1994. The NASD, on its own as well
as on the SES's behalf, hereby requests that the Commission approve a further extension of the Pilot Program for six
months, expiring on November 12, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the proposed extension, each market will transmit to the other static price/volume information compiled
at the end of each trading day on approximately 35 Nasdaq securities which are also traded on the SES. The NASD will transmit
for each Pilot Security the closing inside quotes, cumulative volume, last sale price and the closing quote of every
Nasdaq market maker in each of the Pilot Securities (collectively referred to as ``NASD information''). In recognition
of the SES's use of the order-driven CLOB system, the SES will transmit the following data elements for each Pilot security:
closing price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the price of the final transaction in the CLOB on that business day), the highest and lowest prices at which transactions
were effected, and the aggregate volume (collectively referred to as ``SES information'').
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Because all trading of Pilot Securities on the SES occurs in the CLOB, the price information sent to the NASD will reflect
the prices of actual trades consummated by the automated matching of buy and sell orders resident in the CLOB system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If no trades are effected in a Pilot security on a given day, the SES will transmit no data on that issue even if bids or
offers had been entered into the CLOB for possible execution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CLOB is a fully automated trading system that was instituted by the SES in 1989. Prior to that time, the SES employed
a quote-driven, market maker system similar to the Nasdaq Stock Market. Orders to buy and sell securities are entered
into the CLOB through some 1,800 trading terminals on the premises of approximately 26 SES member firms. The CLOB provides
an electronic limit order file with open orders ranked by price and time in each security. When the terms of two orders
match, the CLOB generates an automated execution accompanied by confirmations back to the originating brokers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;28, the SES intends to incorporate the Pilot Securities into ``CLOB
International.'' The latter is a separate section of the SES market system for the trading of foreign issues that are
not listed on the SES. These securities trade through the CLOB in the same manner as SES-listed securities. CLOB International
currently includes the stocks of Malaysian, Hong Kong, and Philippine issuers. The SES regards inclusion of the Pilot
Securities in CLOB International as a logical step in the progression of the Pilot Program. Further, the SES believes
that this step could stimulate greater trading interest in Nasdaq securities among Singapore investors. Accordingly,
both the NASD and the SES desire to continue the Pilot Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation of Pilot Securities into CLOB International will not alter the basic operation of the Pilot Program,
namely, the interchange of static, end-of-day information on the Pilot Securities. SES information will continue
to be offered only to subscribers of Nasdaq Level 2/3 services.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, NASD information transmitted to Singapore will be available only on the terminals used by SES members
to access the CLOB. The original linkage agreement between the NASD and the SES will remain in effect for the term of
the extended Pilot Program. That agreement, which provides for the sharing of regulatory information as needed,
is believed adequate given the limited nature and limited scope of the Pilot Program.

To retrieve this information, a Nasdaq subscriber must enter a discrete query through a Nasdaq Workstation device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the NASD acknowledges that any further enhancement to the Pilot Program, including the introduction of
automated order routing and execution facilities, would require concurrent authorizations from the Commission
and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. No such enhancement is planned for implementation during the requested
extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that Sections 11A(a)(1) (B) and (C), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(a)(1) of the Act provide the statutory basis
for this proposed rule change. Subsections (B) and (C) of Section 11A(a)(1) set forth the Congressional goals of achieving
more efficient and effective market operations, the availability of information with respect to quotations for
securities and the execution of investor orders in the best market through the application of new data processing
and communications techniques. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of the NASD be designed
to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information
with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market. Finally, Section 17A(a)(1) reflects the Congressional goals of linking all clearance and
settlement facilities and reducing costs involved in the clearance and settlement process through new data processing
and communications techniques. The NASD submits that extension of the Pilot Program will further these ends by providing
the cooperative regulatory environment and operating experience needed for advancement of these goals in the context
of internationalization of securities markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The extended Pilot Program will permit the continued exchange of static market data on a limited group of Nasdaq securities
between the NASD and the SES on a non-exclusive basis. The costs of supporting the Pilot Program are nominal, and the
sponsoring markets absorb their respective costs. The market information being exchanged by the NASD and SES under
the Pilot Program is deemed to constitute an exchange of equivalent value. Hence, no additional fee is paid by NASD
and SES member firms for receipt of the static data being provided on Pilot Securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD submits that neither the structure no operation of the present Pilot Program poses any burden on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comment on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD did not solicit or receive written comments on this rule proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD requests that the Commission find, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, good cause for approving the proposed
rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publishing notice of the filing and, in any event, by May 12, 1994.
The NASD believes that accelerated approval is appropriate for the following reasons: (1) The experimental character
of the Pilot Program and the need to maintain continuity in its operation; (2) the commitment not to make any significant
operational changes during the requested extension absent Commission approval; (3) the limited nature of the Pilot
Program, both in terms of the number of Pilot securities and the amount of market information being exchanged; and
(4) the limited utility of end-of-day, static information to the NASD and SES member firms capable of accessing, respectively,
SES and NASD information. Moreover, during the period of the proposed extension, the sponsoring markets remain committed
to exchange regulatory information whenever the need arises. Finally, if accelerated approval is not granted, the
sponsors will be obliged to terminate this experimental program before its potential benefits can be realized in
relation to the globalization of securities markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 11A(a)(1) (B) and
(C), 15A(b)(6), 17A(a)(1) and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publishing
of notice of filing thereof. The Commission believes that accelerated approval is appropriate to maintain continuity
in the Pilot Program and to allow the sponsors to continue to assess the impact of the trading of these securities in
the international section of the SES's order-driven market system. Further, the Pilot Program is of a limited nature
and no substantive changes will be implemented during the proposed extension. Accordingly, the Commission believes
that the Pilot Program should not be terminated under these circumstances.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Company and the Trust are open-end management investment companies consisting of multiple series. Nylife
Distributors serves as distributor for the Company and the Trust. New York Life Insurance Company (``New York Life''),
MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, Monitor Capital Advisors, Inc., and Quorum Capital Management Limited
serve as investment advisers to individual series of the Company and the Trust. New York Life serves as administrator
to the Company, and Nylife Distributors serves as administrator to the Trust. Nylife Distributors, MacKay-Shields
Financial Corporation, Monitor Capital Advisors and Quorum Capital Management are wholly owned subsidiaries of
New York Life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants request that relief also extend to all series of the Company or the Trust that may be created in the future
and to other registered open-end management investment companies for which Nylife Distributors, or any entity that
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Nylife Distributors, may serve as investment adviser or
distributor (collectively these investment companies, the Company, and the Trust are the ``Funds'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Multiple Class Distribution System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants propose to establish a multi-class distribution system to enable each of the Funds to create an unlimited
number of classes of shares. Classes could be offered in connection with a 12b&hyph;1 plan (a ``12b&hyph;1 Plan''),
a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative services arrangement (``Administrative Services Arrangement''), neither
a 12b&hyph;1 Plan nor an Administrative Services Arrangement, or a combination of these options. These classes also
could be subject to different sales loads. Classes offered subject to differing types of sales loads would provide
investors the option of purchasing shares that would either be subject to a conventional front-end sales load (the
``Front-End Option''), subject to a CDSC (the ``Deferred Option''), subject to a combination of a front-end load
and a CDSC (the combination option), any of which could be coupled with a 12b&hyph;1 Plan or an Administrative Services
Arrangement, or not subject to any sales charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Under Administrative Services Arrangements, Funds may enter into agreements (``Administrative Services Agreements'')
with organizations to provide services to the clients of the organization, who beneficially own shares of a particular
class. Alternatively, a Fund may enter into an Administrative Services Agreement with the Fund's administrator
to provide services to class shareholders. With respect to each class of shares, the Fund would pay an organization
or the administrator for its services in accordance with its particular Administrative Services Agreement (such
payments are ``Administrative Services Payments'') and the expense of such payments would be borne entirely by the
beneficial owners of the class of shares to which each such Administrative Services Agreement relates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Expenses incurred by a Fund may not be attributable to a particular portfolio or to a particular class of share of
a portfolio (``Corporate Level Expenses''). Certain expenses may be attributable to a portfolio but not attributable
to any particular class of the portfolio's shares (``Fund Expenses''). Corporate Level and Fund Expenses will be
allocated among the classes of shares based on the value of their relative net assets at the beginning of the day. In
addition to the cost of 12b&hyph;1 and/or Administrative Service Payments, each class will bear certain expenses
specifically attributable to the particular class (``Class Expenses''), as provided in condition 1 below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants wish to have the ability to convert shares of one class to those of another class, subject to conditions
5 and 16 below. For example, shares of a Deferred Option class could convert after a specified period of time to shares
of the Front-End Option class in the same portfolio. For purposes of conversion to Front-End Option shares, all shares
in a shareholder's account that had been purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions
paid in respect of Deferred Option shares would be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Deferred
Option shares in the shareholder's fund account convert to Front-End Option shares, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the Deferred Option shares then in the sub-account also would convert to Front-End Option shares. The portion
would be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Deferred Option shares converting to Front-End Option shares
bears to the shareholder's total Deferred Option shares not acquired through dividends and distributions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants propose that each class of shares sold without a front-end sales load or subject to a CDSC be permitted
to be exchanged for shares of a class sold without a front-end sales load or subject to a CDSC in the same or another Fund.
Each class of shares sold with a front-end sales load or subject to a CDSC would be only exchanged for the same class of
shares in a different Fund. The exchange privileges would be operated in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the
Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The CDSC

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c&hyph;1
thereunder, to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on redemptions of certain classes of shares, and to permit the Funds
to waive the CDSC for certain types of redemptions. The requested exemption will supersede three prior orders.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Each Fund's particular CDSC schedule may vary, but the sum of any front-end sales charge, CDSC, and asset based sales
charge will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided in article III, section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'').

2. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares that were purchased more than a specified period of years prior to their redemption
or on shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount that
represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount
paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it will be assumed that
a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, second of shares derived from reinvestment
of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest
period of time.

3. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC (a) on redemptions following the death or disability,
as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), of a shareholder if
redemption is made within one year of death or disability of a shareholder; (b) in connection with distributions permitted
to be made under the Code without penalty from an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan,
other than tax-free rollovers or transfers of assets; (c) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by active
or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the distributor or affiliated companies,
by members of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the distributor, or
any trust, pension, profit sharing plan for the benefit of such persons; (d) on redemptions by New York Life or an affiliate
thereof; (e) in connection with redemptions of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic
withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (f) in connection with redemptions by accounts established with an initial purchase
order of $1 million or more; (g) in connection with redemptions effected by separate accounts or advisory accounts
managed by New York Life or an affiliated company; (h) in connection with redemptions by tax-exempt employee benefit
plans resulting from the adoption or promulgation of any law or regulation pursuant to which continuation of the investment
in the Funds would be improper; (i) in connection with redemptions effected by registered investment companies by
virtue of transactions with a Fund; (j) in connection with redemptions by any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality,
department, authority or agency thereof and by trust companies and bank trust departments; (k) on redemptions made
for the purpose of funding a loan to a participant in a tax-qualified retirement plan permitted to make such loans;
(1) on transfers to (i) other funding vehicles sponsored or distributed by New York Life or an affiliated company or
(ii) guaranteed investment contracts, regardless of the sponsor, within a retirement plan; (m) on redemptions made
to meet required distributions by a charitable remainder trust under section 664 of the Code; and (n) on redemptions

1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe
that any implementing the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution
of their shares and provide a broad array of services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs.
Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights in the manner described above
is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve
borrowings, and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement also will not increase
the speculative character of the shares of a Fund.

2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder permitting applicants to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive
a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants submit that their request permits shareholders purchasing a class of
shares subject to a CDSC to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their
purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase.

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund relate solely
to: (a) The method of financing certain Class Expenses, which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees identified by
the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders
of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred
by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders
of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors'/trustees'
fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class resulting from
12b&hyph;1 and Administrative Services Payments; (c) voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting one class
of shares, except as provided in condition (5) below; (d) exchange features; (e) conversion features; and (f) class
designation differences. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently
identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved
by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The directors of the Company, trustees of the Trust, and the directors/trustees of any subsequently created Funds
(collectively, ``Directors/Trustees''), including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, will approve
the offering of multiple classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the respective meetings
of the Directors/Trustees regarding the deliberations of the Directors/Trustees with respect to the approvals
necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Directors/Trustees' determination
that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds including a
majority of the Directors/Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the
allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of Directors/Trustees,
and the Directors/Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes
for which such expenditures were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the Directors/Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the various classes of
shares. The Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall take such action
as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's adviser and distributor
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors/Trustees. If a conflict arises,
the Fund's adviser and distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new
registered management investment company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If a Fund implements any amendment to its 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by class of shares (for purposes of the Application, ``Class X'') under the plan, existing shares of a class
of shares that converts into Class X shares after a period of time (for purposes of the application, ``Class Y'') will
stop converting into Class X unless the Class Y shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal.
The Directors/Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Class Y shares are exchanged
or converted into a new class of shares (``New Class X''), identical in all material respects to Class X as it existed
prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into
Class X. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange
of all existing Class Y shares for a new class (``New Class Y''), identical to existing Class Y shares in all material
respects except that New Class Y will convert into New Class X. New Class X or New Class Y may be formed without further
exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the Directors/Trustees
reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition (4), any additional cost
associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Class X or New Class Y shall be borne solely by the adviser
and the distributor. Class Y shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Class X shares subject
to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Class X plan and the relationship of such
plan to the Class Y shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Administrative Services Arrangements will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth
in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except
that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Directors/Trustees of the Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review an
approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares will be calculated in the same manner, at the same
time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that plan payments made by a class under its 12b&hyph;1 Plan
or Administrative Services Arrangement and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to applicants that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The workpapers of the Expert with respect to such reports,
following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff
upon written request by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate
Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators
or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``request on policies and procedures
placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and
tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time
to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value, dividends and distributions, and sales loads of the various classes of shares and
the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the
Expert in the initial report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate
substitute Expert on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (9) above.
Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert, or appropriate
substitute Expert.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The prospectuses of each class of a Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person
entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect
to one particular class of shares over another in that Fund.

12. Each Fund's distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Directors/Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales charges, deferred sales charges, and exchange privileges (if any) applicable to each class of shares in every
prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose
the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The
shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information
related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared
on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales
literature describes the expenses and/or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose
the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by
applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value or public offering price
will present each class of shares separately.

Administrative Services Arrangement in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Any conversion of shares from one class to another will be based on the relative net assets of the two classes, without
the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an
asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules
of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which
they were subject prior to the conversion.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 10, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange. Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of Rule 103A is to encourage a high level of market quality and performance in Exchange listed securities.
Rule 103A grants authority to the Exchange's Market Performance Committee (``MPC'') to develop and administer systems
and procedures, including the determination of appropriate standards and measurements of performance, designed
to measure specialist performance and market quality on a periodic basis to determine whether or not particular specialist
units need to take actions to improve their performance.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Based on such determinations, the MPC is authorized to conduct a formal Performance Improvement Action in an appropriate
case.

The Commission originally approved the implementation of the Rule 103A pilot program in Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 25681 (May 9, 1988), 53 FR 17287 (May 16, 1988) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;87&hyph;25)
and subsequently extended the effectiveness of Rule 103A in Release Nos. 28215 (July 17, 1990) (``July 1990 Order''),
55 FR 30060 (July 24, 1990) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;24); 29180 (May 8, 1991), 56 FR 22498
(order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;91&hyph;14) and 32285 (May 10, 1993), 58 FR 28905 (May 17, 1993) (``May
10 Order''). The July 1990 Order also approved various substantive revisions to Rule 103A including, among other
things, enhancing the performance criteria for administrative messages received through the Designated Order
Turnaround (``DOT'') system, and, at the same time, extended the effectiveness of the revised Rule 103A until May
9, 1991 [see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28215]. Subsequently, on February 27, 1991, the Commission approved
the NYSE's proposal to adopt relative performance standards into the Rule 103A program [see Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 28923 (February 27, 1991), 56 FR 9993 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;44)].

On May 10, 1993, the SEC extended the effectiveness of Rule 103A until May 9, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In this order, the Commission stated its belief that the Exchange should develop objective performance standards
to measure specialist performance.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the Commission recently approved, on a one-year pilot basis, an objective measure of specialist performance
dealing with specialist utilization of capital for market-making.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This measure of performance focuses on a specialist unit's use of its own capital in relation to the total dollar value
of trading activity in the unit's stocks. Tiered rankings based on a unit's capital utilization are provided to the
Exchange's Allocation Committee as one of the objective measures it considers in allocating stocks to specialist
units under its Allocation Policy and Procedures.

The Commission notes that the Exchange's current evaluation criteria under Rule 103A.10 include objective standards
that measure specialist performance at the opening (both regular and delayed), systematized order turnaround,
and the timeliness of a unit's response to status requests. Specialist performance also is measured by the Exchange's
Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire. However, objective market making measures currently are not
included in the Rule 103A program.

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33369 (December 22, 1993), 58 FR 69431 (December 30, 1993). This measure of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange, with the assistance of outside consultants, continues to work to develop additional objective measures
of specialist performance. As Rule 103A is working well, the Exchange requests that its effectiveness be extended
for an additional year, until May 9, 1995.

2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange
have rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public
interest. The proposed extension of Rule 103A is consistent with these objectives in that it will allow the Exchange
to continue to administer the rule on an uninterrupted basis ensuring quality specialist performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules of the Exchange, in addition to the rules set forth under the Act, impose certain obligations upon the specialist
unit, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Because specialist units play a crucial role in providing stability, liquidity and continuity to the trading of stocks
on the Exchange, the Commission believes that effective oversight, including periodic evaluation of the specialists'
performance, is important to the maintenance of a fair and efficient marketplace. Critical to this oversight is the
specialist performance evualation process embodied in Rule 103A.

</FOOTNOTE>

In the May 10 Order, the Commission reiterated its desire for the Exchange to develop objective measures of market
making performance and incorporate such measures into the proposed rule change to extend the Rule 103A pilot.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission's request was consistent with its previous orders approving the extension of the Rule 103A pilot program.
In fact, the Exchange informed the Commission that it had employed the services of an outside expert to study the feasibility
of adopting such objective measures of specialist performance.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 To date, however, the Exchange has not finished its development of objective measures of market making performance.
Indeed, in the proposed rule change, the Exchange states that it continues to work to develop additional objective
performance standards. The Exchange requests that the Commission extend the effectiveness of the rule for an additional
year because the rule is working well. However, the proposal herein to extend Rule 103A until May 9, 1995, does not include
objective measures of market making performance as the Commission originally and requested.

Even though the proposal lacks objective market marking performance standards, the Commission has determined to
approve the proposal to extend the effectiveness of Rule 103A for an additional year in light of the significant enhancements
the NYSE has made to the Rule 103A program thus far, and the substantial time and resources the Exchange already has
dedicated to the development of objective criteria. The revision to Rule 103A, adopted in July, 1990
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
, the subsequent adoption of relative performance standards
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
, and the refinement of existing standards
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 have augmented the Exchange's ability to evaluate specialist performance. In this regard, the Commission also notes
that the Exchange has developed a new measure of capital utilization by specialists, even though that measure has
not yet been incorporated in to the Rule 103A evaluation criteria.

As noted in previous orders,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission stated that the mature status of the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS''), as a market structure facility,
warrants the incorporation of ITS turnaround and trade-through concerns
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 into the NYSE's Rule 103A performance standards. The NYSE has responded to the Commission's request that it incorporate
ITS turnaround and trade-through concerns into Rule 103A.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the Exchange stated that ITS matters are more appropriately addressed by means of the Exchange's regulatory
processes rather than by its performance measurement system. According to the Exchange, it has emphasized to speciality
that all ITS commitments to trade are expected to be executed, and will take appropriate regulatory action if specialists
are deficient in this matter. Moreover, the Exchange states that trade-throughs are not always the responsibility
of the specialist and, therefore, would not appear to be an appropriate measure of specialist performance. In the
Exchange's view, the current ITS trade-through resolution process works well, and is the appropriated means for
addressing ITS trade-through concerns.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Despite the contentions of the Exchange, the Commission believes that evaluating the ITS turnaround and trade-through
concerns can be a valid measurement of specialist performance and should be incorporated into the evaluation process.
For example, the NYSE should measure how many times NYSE specialists trade-through other markets and how often specialists'
ITS commitments expire. Although we agree with the NYSE that these factors should be addressed, where appropriate,
by regulatory action, we also believe these factors can be a valid indication of specialist performance in the current
trading environment.

The Commission continues to believe that the Exchange should develop objective performance standards that would
measure accurately the traditional indicia of specialist performance, namely, market depth, price continuity
and dealer participation and stabilization. The Commission continues to encourage the NYSE to incorporate objective
standards into the Rule 103A program prior to or simultaneous with the NYSE's future proposal to extend the effectiveness
of Rule 103A or adopt the Rule on a permanent basis.

In this regard, the Commission expects the NYSE to submit to the Division of Market Regulation, by February 28, 1995,
a proposed rule change pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4, to extend the Rule 103A pilot
or make the Rule permanent. As emphasized above, this proposed rule change should include objective measures of market
making performance that have been developed by the outside experts retained by the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, as of December 1994, the NYSE should have a full year's experience with the new capital utilization
measure. Assuming that the experience with the capital utilization measure is good, the NYSE should incorporate
the new measure in the Rule 103A evaluation prior to the Exchange's next request for an extension or permanent approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also expects the Exchange to submit to the Division, by February 28, 1995, a status report on the implementation
of Rule 103A. The report should contain data, for each quarter of 1994, on (1) the number of specialists that fell below
acceptance levels of performance for each category; (2) the number of performance improvement actions commenced;
(3) the number of units subjected to informal counseling to improve performance; and (4) a list of stocks reallocated
due to substandard performance under the Rule and the Particular unit involved.

The Commission has reviewed carefully the NYSE's proposed rule change and, for the above reasons, believes that the
proposal is consistent with the requirements of sections 6 and 11 of the Act
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular, the Commission
believes that the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirement that the rules of the Exchange be designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open national market system,
and, in general, further investor protection and the public interest. Further, the Commission finds that the proposal
is consistent with section 11(b) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 which allow securities exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists consistent with the maintenance of
fair and orderly markets.

Specifically, the Commission believes that the NYSE's Rule 103A performance evaluation process provides the Exchange
with the means to identify and correct poor specialist performance. Accordingly, the evaluation process is critical
to the NYSE's duty to ascertain whether specialists are maintaining fair and orderly markets in their assigned securities,
as required pursuant to Exchange rules and the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, the possibility
of a performance improvement action as a result of the evaluation process, in addition to the use of the evaluation
results in stock allocation decisions, should help motivate and provide incentives for specialists to maintain
and improve their market making performance for the benefit of investors. In summary, extension of Rule 103A's effectiveness
until May 9, 1995 will provide the Exchange with the ability to continue evaluating specialist performance on an uninterrupted
basis, which should enhance market quality and performance in Exchange listed securities. During the pilot, the
Exchange should continue to consider and develop objective measures which evaluate both ITS matters and market making
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission believes it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis so that the
Exchange can continue to administer, on an uninterrupted basis, its Rule 103A evaluation process. During the one
year extension of the Rule, the Commission expects the NYSE to continue its examination of the efficacy of its current
specialist evaluation procedures, as well as determine whether to extend the pilot for a further period or, in the
alternative, approve Rule 103A on a permanent basis. Finally, a substantial portion of current Rule 103A was noticed
for the full statutory period in 1987, and the Commission did not receive any adverse commentary on the revised Rule
103A program.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Further, interested persons were invited to comment on the past proposals to extend the effectiveness of Rule 103A,
the most recent of such proposals being the extension of Rule 103A until May 9, 1994. The Commission received no comments
on these proposals. The Commission believes, therefore, that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule
change is appropriate and consistent with section 6 of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons set forth above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 6(b)(5)
and 11(b) under the Act, and Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;7) is approved for the period ending May 9, 1995.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trusts are diversified, open-end management investment companies. Trust I currently has eight series: Emerging
Growth Fund, International Equity Fund, Growth &amp; Income Fund, Balanced Fund, Income Opportunity Fund, Bond
Fund, Municipal Bond Fund, and Standby Reserve Fund. Trust II currently has seven series: Emerging Growth Fund, International
Equity Fund, Growth &amp; Income Fund, Balanced Fund, Income Opportunity Fund, Bond Fund, and Municipal Bond Fund.
The series of Trust I and Trust II are referred to collectively as the ``Series.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trusts invest the assets of each of their Series (with the exception of the Standby Reserve Fund) in a corresponding
portfolio that is a series of the Select Advisors Portfolios (the ``Portfolio Trust''), an open-end management investment
company which currently offers seven series. Investments in the Portfolio Trust are made through the Signature Financial
Group, Inc. (``Signature'') Hub and Spoke
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 financial service method. The Portfolio Trust on behalf of each portfolio, and Trust I on behalf of the Standby Reserve
Fund, have entered into an investment advisory agreement with Touchstone Investment Advisors, Inc. (the ``Adviser'')
and an administrative services and fund accounting agreement with Signature. The Trusts have entered into an agreement
for administrative services and fund accounting services with Signature and a distribution agreement with the Distributor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Shares of Trust I (other than Standby Reserve Fund, which has no sales charge) are offered at net asset value plus
a front-end sales charge at a rate of up to 5.75% of the offering price. Each Series of Trust I (other than Standby Reserve
Fund) also imposes a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of its average daily net assets.
No front-end sales charge is payable with respect to purchases of $1,000,000 or more of shares of Trust I. Shares of
Trust II are offered without an initial sales charge, but are subject to rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution and shareholder
services fees at an annual rate of up to 1% of each Series' average daily net assets. Applicants now propose to allow
the Trusts to impose a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares and to waive the CDSC under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under the proposed CDSC arrangement, applicants generally will impose a CDSC of 1% on redemptions of shares of Trust
I which have been acquired without a sales charge through a purchase of $1,000,000 or more and are redeemed within one
year of their purchase. Applicants also propose to impose a CDSC of 1% on redemption of shares of Trust II made within
one year of their date of purchase. Applicants in the future may decide to increase or reduce the CDSC percentage, shorten
the applicable holding period, or create a scheduled range of CDSC percentages. Any future changes or variations
will be disclosed in each affected prospectus and will not affect any shares of the Trusts that were issued prior to
the disclosure thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The CDSC will be equal to a percentage of the lesser of (a) the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase,
or (b) the net asset value of the shares at the time of redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts derived from capital
appreciation, shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions. In determining
whether a CDSC is applicable, it will be assumed that shares not subject to the CDSC are redeemed first and that other
shares are then redeemed in the order purchased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No CDSC will be imposed on exchanges or Trust shares in compliance with rule 11a&hyph;3. If, however, the shares
acquired in an exchange are redeemed within one year following the original investment, the CDSC will be assessed.
No CDSC will be imposed on shares purchased prior to the date the SEC grants the requested order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Distributor will provide a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund, out of its own assets, of any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares of a Trust (by crediting such
refunded CDSC to the shareholder's account) if, within 90 days of such redemption, all or any portion of the redemption
proceeds are reinvested in shares of the Trusts. The reinvested amount will be subject to the CDSC applicable prior
to the redemption, and the CDSC time period will run from the original investment date but will be extended by the number
of days between the redemption and reinvestment date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The CDSC will be waived or reduced in the following instances: (a) In connection with distributions from qualified
retirement plans and other employee benefit plans qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
``Code''); (b) distributions from a custodial account under section 403(b)(7) of the Code or an individual retirement
account (an ``IRA'') due to death, disability, or attainment of age 591/2; (c) a tax-free return of an excess contribution
to an IRA; (d) for any partial or complete redemptions following death or disability (as defined in section 72(m)(7)
of the Code) of a shareholder from an account in which the deceased or disabled is named, provided the redemption is
made within one year of death or initial determination of disability; (e) involuntary redemptions as described in
each prospectus; and (f) redemptions by (i) current or retired directors, trustees, partners, officers, and employees
of Trust I, Trust II, the Portfolio Trust, the Distributor, the Advisor, family members of these persons, and trusts
or plans primarily for such persons, (ii) trustees or other fiduciaries purchasing shares for certain retirement
plans; and (iii) participants in pension, profit-sharing or employee benefit plans that are sponsored by the Distributor
and its affiliates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants submit that the proposal to impose a CDSC is fair, in the public interest and the interest of the Trust's
shareholders, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
the provisions of the Act. Consequently, applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to section 6(c) of
the Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder
to the extent necessary to permit the proposed CDSC arrangement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern proposes to acquire, and Development proposes to issue and sell, common stock and notes up to $275 million
from time to time through December 31, 1998, with maturities no later than December 31, 2003. Such loans will bear an
interest rate equal to a rate not to exceed the prime rate in effect on the date of the loan at a bank designated by Southern.
In addition, Development proposes to convert the notes to capital contributions (through Southern's forgiveness
of the debt evidenced thereby). Alternatively, Southern proposes to make up to $275 in cash capital contributions
to Development from time to time through December 31, 1998.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development proposes to issue and sell to third parties, and Southern proposes to guarantee, up to $275 million in
notes or other recourse liabilities from time to time through December 31, 1998, the maturities of which will not extend
past December 31, 2003. The loans evidenced by such notes will be made with an interest rate not to exceed 3% over the
lender bank's prime rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development proposes to acquire promissory notes evidencing the debt of customers in connection with financing
energy management and efficiency equipment. Further, Development may assign evidences of customer indebtedness
to Southern in consideration of a reduction in the amount of outstanding notes, in which case the aggregate amount
of outstanding customer indebtedness held by Southern would be added to the aggregate amount of outstanding notes
issued by Development and held by Southern for purposes of the proposed $50 million limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes to provide performance guarantees and to undertake other contractual obligations with respect
to the performance and other obligations of Development under contracts and bids with third parties. Southern proposes
to provide guarantees in an aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $200 million through December 31, 2003;
provided, that any guarantees or indemnifications outstanding at December 31, 2003 shall continue until expiration
or termination in accordance with their terms. For purposes of computing the above limitation, neither Southern's
agreements to provide guarantees or indemnifications of sureties of Development which have not actually been issued,
nor Development's joint venture partner's respective shares of any joint venture obligations or indemnification
of sureties of the joint venture, shall be counted. In addition, Southern and Development request that they have the
flexibility to negotiate specific guarantees and similar provisions and arrangements with third parties, and indemnifications
of sureties, as the need to do so arises, without further Commission authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development proposes to enter into new service agreements with Southern Company Services, Inc. (``Services'')
and each of the operating electric utility companies (each an ``Operating Company'', collectively, ``Operating
Companies'') that will be substantially identical to the existing agreements between Development and Services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development proposes to undertake activities, including advertising and marketing studies, additional pilot
tests, testing of various manufacturers' equipment, and purchases of equipment and software enhancements, among
other activities, with a view to commercializing POWERcall and related customer services
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 throughout Alabama and Georgia and in the Gulf region of Mississippi and Florida. Development also requests authority
to enter into agreements with utilities that are interconnected with Southern System companies pursuant to which
Development would offer POWERcall and related services to the customers of such non-affiliated utilities. Development
proposes to invest up to $10 million in connection with these activities.

POWERcall is described as a utility customer service involving the installation of a device at a customer's premises
which would monitor and automatically report power outages to a utility's operations center. Development states
that it is investigating the additional capabilities of the monitoring device and its related software to determine
the commercial feasibility of providing certain monitoring services in addition to POWERcall. Such additional
services would include both energy-related services, such as automated meter reading and temperature monitoring,
and other services, such as fire, intrusion and health alarm services.

Development also proposes to offer to utility customers directly, or indirectly through public utility companies,
a broader range of energy management services, including demandside management (``DSM'') measures, and, in connection
therewith, proposes to invest in energy management equipment and/or provide customer financing for the purchase
of equipment from third party vendors and suppliers. Specifically, Development proposes to: (1) Engage in energy
management services, including_(a) Design of modifications and new equipment, (b) management or direct installation
of new equipment, (c) the entry into performance contracts (where Development is paid on the basis of actual energy
savings), (d) the arrangement of third-party financing for conservation programs, (e) the training personnel in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gulf States Utilities Company (``GSU''), 350 Pine Street, Beaumont, Texas 77701, an electric utility subsidiary
company of Energy Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration pursuant to
sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(c) and 12(d) of the Act and Rules 42, 44(b), 50 and 50(a)(5) thereunder. GSU proposes
to engage in the transactions described herein from time to time through December 31, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU proposes to issue and sell not more than $700 million aggregate principal amount of: (1) One or more series of its
preferred stock, cumulative, $100 par value, and/or its preferred stock, cumulative, without per value (``Preferred'');
(2) one or more new series of its first mortgage bonds (``Bonds''); and/or (3) one or more new sub-series of the medium
term note series of its first mortgage bonds (``MTNs'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each series of Bonds or sub-series of MTNs will be sold at such price, will bear interest at such rates and will mature
on such date (not more than 40 years from the first day of the month of issuance) as will be determined at the time of sale.
No series of Bonds or sub-series of MTNs will be issued at rates in excess of those generally obtained at the time of pricing
for sales of first mortgage bonds or medium term notes having the same maturity, issued by companies of comparable
credit quality and having similar terms, conditions and features. The price, exclusive of accrued interest, to be
paid for each series of Bonds to be sold at competitive bidding will be within a rang of not more than 5 percentage points,
but shall not exceed 5 percentage points above or below 100% of the principal amount of such series of Bonds, and the
price of each sub-series of MTNs will be within a range of 95&hyph;105% of the principal amount. GSU requests an exemption
from the Commission's Statement of Policy Regarding First Mortgage Bonds (HCAR No. 13105, February 16, 1956, as modified
by HCAR No. 16369, May 8, 1969) (``Bond SOP'') to the extent that, among other things, the redemption provisions, the
sinking fund provisions (or lack thereof), the covenant limiting common stock dividends and/or the maintenance
and replacement provisions (or lack thereof) with respect to any series of Bonds or sub-series of MTNs deviate from
the Bond SOP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The price, exclusive of accumulated dividends, for each series of Preferred will be determined at the tome of sale
and will not be less than par or stated value on a per share basis. The price to be paid for any series of Preferred to be
sold at competitive bidding will not be less than par or stated value nor more than 102.75% thereof per share, plus accumulated
dividends, if any. No series of Preferred would be sold if the dividend rate thereon would exceed those generally obtained
at the time of pricing for sales of preferred stock of the same par or stated value, issued by companies of comparable
credit quality and having similar terms, conditions and features. GSU requests an exemption from the Commission's
Statement of Policy Regarding Preferred Stock (HCAR No. 13106, February, 16, 1956, as modified by HCAR No. 16758,
June 22, 1970) (``Stock SOP'') to the extent that, among other things, the redemption provisions of any series of Preferred
deviate from the Stock SOP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending upon market conditions, GSU may sell one or more series of Preferred having a par value of $100 to underwriters
for deposit with a bank or trust company (``Depositary''). The underwriters would then receive from the Depositary
and deliver to the repurchasers in the subsequent public offering shares of depositary preferred stock (``Depositary
Preferred''), each representing a stated fraction of a share of the Preferred. Depositary Preferred would be evidenced
by depositary receipts. Each owner of Depositary Preferred would be entitled proportionally to all the rights and
preferences of the series of Preferred (including dividends, redemption and voting). A holder of Depositary Preferred
will be entitled to surrender Depositary Preferred to the Depositary and receive the number of whole shares of Preferred
represented thereby. A holder of Preferred will be entitled to surrender shares of Preferred to the Depositary and
receive a proportional amount of Depositary Preferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU proposes to use the net proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of the Bonds, MTNs and/or Preferred for general
corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of outstanding securities when due and/or the possible
redemption, acquisition or refunding of certain outstanding securities prior to their stated maturity or due date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU states that it may sell the Bonds, MTNs and Preferred pursuant to the competitive bidding requirements of Rule
50, or, by means of agency arrangements or direct placement with purchasers under an exception from the competitive
bidding requirements of Rule 50 pursuant to Rule 50(a)(5), in the event that GSU determines that a negotiated public
offering or private placement would be advantageous. GSU requests authorization to undertake negotiations with
respect to arrangements for the issuance and sale of the Bonds, MTNs and Preferred. It may do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU also proposes to enter into arrangements for the issuance and sale of tax-exempt bonds (``Tax-Exempt Bonds''),
and in connection therewith, GSU proposes to enter into one or more equipment lease/sublease arrangements (``Equipment
Lease''), pursuant to which one or more governmental authorities (``Issuers'') may issue one or more series of Tax-Exempt
Bonds under one or more indentures (``Indenture'') in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $250 million. The
net proceeds from the sale of the Tax-Exempt Bonds will be used to finance certain facilities including but not limited
to sewage and/or solid waste disposal or pollution control facilities (``Facilities'') that have not heretofore
been the subject of such financing, or to refinance outstanding tax-exempt bonds issued for that purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU further proposes, under the Equipment Lease, to acquire, construct and install the Facilities, and lease the
Facilities to the Issuers and simultaneously sublease such Facilities from the Issuers at subrentals sufficient
(together with other monies held by the trustee under the applicable Indenture and available for such purpose) to
pay the principal or redemption price of, premium, if any, interest and other amounts owing on the Tax-Exempt Bonds
together with related expenses. Under the Equipment Lease, GSU will also be obligated to pay certain fees incurred
in connection with the transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Equipment Lease and the Indenture may provide for either a fixed interest rate or an adjustable interest rate for
each series of the Tax-Exempt Bonds. No series of Tax-Exempt Bonds would be sold if the fixed interest rate or initial
adjustable interest rate thereon would exceed the lower of 13% or rates generally obtained at the time of pricing for
sales of tax-exempt bonds having the same maturity, issued for the benefit of companies of comparable credit quality
and having similar terms, conditions and features. The Tax-Exempt Bonds will mature not earlier than five years from
the first day of the month of issuance nor later than 40 years from the date of issuance. Each series may be subject to
redemption and/or sinking fund provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU proposes to arrange for one or more irrevocable letters of credit, in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and
for a term not to exceed ten years, from a bank, in favor of the trustee for one or more series of Tax-Exempt Bonds. GSU
would enter into a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement (``Reimbursement Agreement'') with the bank under
which GSU would agree to reimburse the bank for amounts drawn under the letter of credit within 60 months with the interest
rate not to exceed the bank's prime commercial loan rate plus 2% and to pay certain fees, including up-front fees not
to exceed $100,000 and annual fees not to exceed 11/4% of the face amount of the letter of credit. Provision may be made
for extension of the term of such letter of credit or for the replacement thereof, upon its expiration or termination,
by another letter of credit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, or as an alternative to a letter of credit, GSU may: (1) Provide an insurance policy for one or more series
of Tax-Exempt Bonds, and/or (2) obtain authentication of and pledge one or more new series of its First Mortgage Bonds
(``Collateral Bonds'') to be issued under GSU's mortgage and delivered to the trustee or the bank to evidence and secure
GSU's obligations under the Equipment Lease or the Reimbursement Agreement. Such Collateral Bonds could be issued:
(1) In a principal amount equal to the principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds and bearing interest at a rate equal to the
rate of interest on such Tax-Exempt Bonds; (2) in a principal amount equivalent to the principal amount of Tax-Exempt
Bonds plus an amount equal to interest on those Tax-Exempt Bonds for a specified period and bearing no interest; (3)
in a principal amount equivalent to the principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds or in such amount plus an amount equal
to interest on those Tax-Exempt Bonds for a specified period, but carrying a fixed interest rate that would be lower
than the fixed interest rate of the Tax-Exempt Bonds; or (4) in a principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds at an adjustable
rate of interest, varying with such Tax-Exempt Bonds but having a ceiling rate of 13%. Each series of the Collateral
Bonds that would bear interest would do so at a fixed interest rate or initial adjustable interest rate not to exceed
13%. The terms of the Collateral Bonds will correspond to the terms of the related Tax-Exempt Bonds. The maximum amount
of the Collateral Bonds would be $300 million, and the Collateral Bonds would be in addition to the aggregate limitation
on the Bonds specified above. In connection with the proposed Tax-Exempt Bonds financing, GSU requests a finding
of the Commission that competitive bidding of Collateral Bonds pursuant to Rule 50 is inappropriate since the Collateral
Bonds would be issued and pledged solely to secure GSU's obligations and no public offering of the Collateral Bonds
would be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSU also proposes to use, in addition to or as an alternative for the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds, MTNs, Preferred
and/or Tax-Exempt Bonds, other available funds to acquire, through tender offers, open market or negotiated purchases,
in whole or in part, prior to their respective maturities, not more than $600 million aggregate principal amount and
par value and/or stated value of: (1) One or more series of GSU's outstanding first mortgage bonds or sub-series of
MTNs, (2) one or more series of GSU's outstanding preferred stock, (3) one or more series of outstanding tax-exempt
bonds heretofore issued for the benefit of GSU, (4) GSU's outstanding series of debentures, and/or (5) GSU's outstanding
series of preference stock. GSU states that it will not use the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds, MTNs, Preferred

Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company (``LP&amp;L''), 639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, an electric
utility subsidiary company of Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), a registered holding company, has filed an declaration,
pursuant to Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LP&amp;L proposes to issue and sell up to $326 million in secured lease obligation bonds (``Refunding Bonds''), in
one or more series through December 31, 1995, in order to redeem approximately $310 million in previously issued and
sold secured lease obligation bonds (``Original Bonds'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By orders dated September 26, 1989 (HCAR No. 24956) and September 27, 1989 (HCAR No. 24958) (``Orders''), LP&amp;L
sold to and leased back from three separate trusts ``(Lessors''), on a long-term net lease basis pursuant to three
separate facility leases (``Leases''), an approximate 9.3% aggregate ownership interest (``Undivided Interests'')
in Unit No. 3 of the Waterford nuclear power plant (``Waterford 3'') in three almost identical but separate transactions.
The First National Bank of Commerce (``Owner-Trustee'') is the trustee for these trusts. LP&amp;L now has an approximate
9.3% leasehold interest in Waterford 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purchase price of the Undivided Interests was $353.6 million. About $43,603,000 was provided through equity
contributions of the owner-participant in each of the three Lessor trusts. About $309,997,000 was provided through
issuance of the Original Bonds by the Owner-Trustee in an underwritten public offering. The Original Bonds consist
of three separate series of secured lease obligation bonds, with an annual interest rate of 10.30%, to mature on January
2, 2005, issued in an aggregate principal amount of $140,452,000 (``2005 Bonds''), and three separate series of secured
lease obligation bonds, with an annual interest rate of 10.67%, to mature on January 2, 2017, issued in an aggregate
principal amount of $169,545,000 (``2017 Bonds'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
LP&amp;L now proposes to have the Owner-Trustee issue the Refunding Bonds either under three amended and supplemented
Indentures of Mortgage and Deeds of Trust dated September 1, 1989 or under comparable instruments (``Indentures'').
The Refunding Bonds will be issued to refund the Original Bonds. In the alternative, LP&amp;L proposes to refund all
or a portion of the Original Bonds with interim funds obtained from banks or other institutions by the Owner-Trustee
(``Interim Funds'') and to then issue Refunding Bonds to retire the Interim Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds and possibly the proceeds of the Interim Funds, possibly together
with funds provided by LP&amp;L, will be used to redeem the Original Bonds and to meet associated issuance costs. The
2005 Bonds are optionally redeemable on July 2, 1994 for 105.150% of their principal amount. The 2017 Bonds are first
optionally redeemable on July 2, 1994 for 108.003% of their principal amount. Should Original Bonds be retired with
the Interim Funds, the proceeds of Refunding Bonds will be used to retire the Interim Funds. It is not anticipated that
there would be a redemption premium associated with the retirement of the Interim Funds. The Refunding Bonds will
be structured and issued under the documents and pursuant to the procedures applicable to the issuance of the Original
Bonds, which documents and procedures are described in the Orders, or comparable documents with similar terms and
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Funds would be provided through one or more domestic or foreign financial institutions (``Interim Lenders''),
which would make loans to the Lessors evidenced by notes issued by the Lessors. The term of the Interim Funds would be
up to the remainder of the basic lease terms under the Leases. LP&amp;L might assume the Interim Funds upon the occurrence
of certain events or if it exercises certain purchase options under the Leases. The Interim Funds would be refunded
with the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. LP&amp;L would use its best efforts to arrange for refunds with desirable
interest rates as quickly as possible after the Interim Funds are required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LP&amp;L is obligated to make payments under the Leases in amounts that will provide for scheduled payments of principal
and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due. Upon the refund of the Original Bonds, amounts payable by LP&amp;L under
the Leases will be adjusted pursuant to the terms of supplements to the Leases to be entered into. A similar procedure
would be used if the Interim Funds are used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Refunding Bonds nor the Interim Funds will be direct obligations of or guaranteed by LP&amp;L. However,
under certain circumstances, LP&amp;L might assume all or a portion of the Refunding Bonds of the Interim Funds. Each
Refunding Bond will be secured by, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) A lien on and security interest in the Undivided Interest of the Lessor that issues the Refunding Bond and (ii) certain
other amounts payable by LP&amp;L thereunder. The notes of the Lessor in evidence of the Interim Funds would also be
secured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Refunding Bonds are to be issued in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples
thereof. Interest on the Refunding Bonds of each series will be payable January 2 and July 2 of each year to commence
with the interest payment date after the initial issuance of the Refunding Bonds. Interest on Interim Funds could
be paid on a different basis. The Refunding Bonds might be redeemed if a Lease is to be terminated prior to the end of the
basic lease term provided for therein. Similar provisions would be applicable to the Interim Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of Refunding Bonds issued through the Owner-Trustee, LP&amp;L might arrange for a funding corporation to
issue the Refunding Bonds, in which case the proceeds from Refunding Bonds would be loaned by the funding corporation
to the Lessors, which would issue notes (``Lessor Notes'') to the funding corporation to evidence the loans and secure
the Refunding Bonds, and the Lessors would use the loans to redeem the Original Bonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms of the Lessor Notes and the indentures for their issuance would reflect the redemption and other terms of
the Refunding Bonds. The rental payments of LP&amp;L would be used for payments on principal and interest on the Lessor
Notes, which payments would be used for payments on Refunding Bonds when due. The Refunding Bonds would be secured
by the Lessor Notes, which would be secured by a lien on and security interest in the Undivided Interests and by certain
rights under the Leases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative to Refunding Bonds issued by the Owner-Trustee would be for LP&amp;L to use a trust structure in which
the Lessors would issue Lessor Notes to one or more passthrough trusts and the trusts would issue certificates in evidence
of ownership interests in the trusts. The debt terms of the Refunding Bonds would be comparable to the terms of the Lessor
Notes and the indentures for their issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LP&amp;L might have some Refunding Bonds or trust certificates to be sold by competitive bidding, negotiated underwritten
public offering, or private placement with institutional investors. LP&amp;L intends to arrange the Interim Funds
through commercial banks or similar institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LP&amp;L believes that it would be impossible to sell the Refunding Bonds or the trust certificates, or to arrange
the Interim Funds, by competitive bidding in accordance with Rule 50. Thus LP&amp;L requests under Rule 50(a)(5)
an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of the rule. LP&amp;L further requests authorization to
negotiate for the sale of the Refunding Bonds or the trust certificates or for the Interim Funds. It may do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LP&amp;L shall not have the Owner-Trustee sell the Refunding Bonds or the trust certificates, or acquire the Interim
Funds, unless: (i) The estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between interest payments
on a new issue of comparable securities and those securities refunded is, on an after-tax basis, in excess of the present
value of all redemption and issuance costs, based on an appropriate discount rate, determined on the basis of the then
estimated after-tax cost of capital of Entergy and its consolidated subsidiaries, or (ii) LP&amp;L shall have obtained
Commission authorization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the separate 1989 participation agreements relative to the sale of the Undivided Interests, LP&amp;L issued
three separate promissory notes to the owner-participants in an aggregate principal amount equal to the highest
of either the maximum net casualty value or the maximum net special casualty value payable under the Leases during
the basic lease term._$208,236,768 on July 2, 1994, which is expected to be the approximate date of the sale. Redemption
of the Original Bonds could, in some circumstances, cause an increase in these values and therefore, require an increase
in the principal amount of the related promissory notes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, LP&amp;L is required to collateralize its obligations to the owner-participants five years after the
sales either through first mortgage bonds in a principal amount equal to that of the promissory notes or a letter of
credit (HCAR No. 24956, September 26, 1989). To the extent the proposed transactions would necessitate the issuance
of promissory notes or first mortgage bonds in a principal amount in excess of that previously authorized, LP&amp;L
also seeks authorization of such increases.

Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike, Muhlenberg Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania
19640, a public-utility subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), a registered holding
company, has filed an amended application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and rules
45, 50(a)(5) and 54 thereunder. A notice of the application-declaration was issued by the Commission on April 22,
1993 (HCAR No. 26034) (``Prior Notice''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the Prior Notice, Met-Ed proposes to organize a special purpose subsidiary (``Met-Ed Capital'')
as either a limited liability company under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (``LLC Act'') or a limited
partnership under the Pennsylvania or Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Met-Ed may also organize
a second special purpose wholly owned subsidiary under the Delaware General Corporation Law (``Investment Sub'')
for the sole purpose of either: (i) Acquiring and holding a second class of Met-Ed Capital common interests so as to
comply with the requirement under the LLC Act that a limited liability company have at least two members or (ii) acting
as the general partner of Met-Ed Capital, assuming a limited partnership structure. Met-Ed Capital will then issue
and sell from time to time in one or more series through June 30, 1996 up to $125 million aggregate stated value of preferred
limited liability company interests or limited partnership interests, in the form of Monthly Income Preferred Stock,
$25 per share stated value (``MIPS''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Met-Ed states that there are certain changes to the transactions as described in the Prior Notice. First, each note
or Subordinated Debenture, as described in the Prior Notice, will have a term of up to 50 years, rather than 30 years
that may be extended for up to an additional 20 years, subject to certain specified conditions.

In addition, Met-Ed states that there are certain changes to the structure of Met-Ed Capital and Investment Sub. Met-Ed
may acquire all of the common stock of Investment Sub for a nominal consideration and may capitalize Investment Sub
with a demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to 10% of the total capitalization of Met-Ed Capital from
time to time, or up to an initial principal amount of $13 million. If Met-Ed Capital is organized as a limited partnership,
Investment Sub may also acquire up to a 3% general partnership interest in Met-Ed Capital. The amount of such capital
contribution (up to $4.0 million), together with the gross proceeds received by Met-Ed Capital from the issuance
and sale of the MIPS (i.e., a maximum of $125 million), would be applied by Met-Ed Capital to acquire Met-Ed's Subordinated
Debentures. The total equity contributions by Met-Ed to Met-Ed Capital would not exceed $35 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Met-Ed may acquire a separate class of limited partnership interest in Met-Ed Capital for a nominal consideration

Partnership Act.

Allegheny Power System, Inc., (``Allegheny''), 12 East 49th Street, New York, New York, 10017, a registered holding
company, has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules
45, 87,90 and 91 promulgated thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allegheny requests Commission authorization through December 31, 1996 to organize and finance a new wholly-owned
non-utility subsidiary company_AYP Capital, Inc., (``AYP'')_that would invest directly or indirectly in (i) companies
involved in new technologies that are related to the core business of Allegheny; and (ii) companies for the acquisition
and ownership of exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs'') within the definition of Section 32 of the Act. Allegheny
also proposes through December 31, 1996 to invest up to $500,000 in AYP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allegheny proposes to incorporate AYP in Delaware with initial authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common
stock (no par value) and to subscribe to 100 shares of AYP common stock for $10.00 per share. Allegheny also proposes
to fund AYP from time to time through December 31, 1996 through purchases of additional AYP stock, or capital contributions,
in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000. AYP will use those funds to pursue appropriate investment opportunities
in new technologies or in EWGs. Allegheny proposes to obtain funds for this purpose from: (i) Sales of Allegheny common
stock pursuant to its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase and Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plans, (ii)
regular bank lines of credit, or (iii) internal sources. Allegheny states that it will not guarantee indebtedness
of AYP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allegheny states that it anticipates that AYP will have no paid employees and that personnel employed by Allegheny
Power Service Corporation (``Allegheny Service''), a wholly-owned nonutility subsidiary company of Allegheny,
will provide a wide range of services, on an as-needed basis, to AYP pursuant to a service agreement to be entered into
between AYP and Allegheny Service. Under this service agreement, AYP will reimburse Allegheny Service for the cost
of services provided in accordance with Rules 90 and 91 of the Act. All time spent by Allegheny Service employees on
AYP matters will be billed to and paid by AYP on a monthly basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allegheny states that AYP will maintain separate financial records with profit and loss statements. Allegheny Service,
it is stated, pursuant to the service agreement with AYP, will be responsible for the financial records and for audit
procedures that are in compliance with generally accepted principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to EWGs, Allegheny states that if AYP acquires an interest in an EWG, it will use Allegheny Service employees
or other Allegheny system employees ``within a de minimis limit'' for services. It is stated that AYP will not use in
excess of 2% of the total employees of all other Allegheny system domestic public utility companies for services to
an affiliated EWG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to new technologies related to its core business, Allegheny states that there are significant opportunities
for investment in companies engaged in the development of new technologies that would promote the public interest
through efficient and clean electric power generation and utilization. It is stated that the new technologies would
be related to: (i) Electric power conversion and storage; (ii) conservation, load management, and demand side management;
(iii) environmental and waste treatment; (iv) advanced computer hardware and software; (v) power-related electronic
systems, control systems and components; (vi) electronic automation systems and components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allegheny states that, to invest in EWGs or in companies engaged in new technologies, AYP might directly invest or
seek experienced investment partners and structure investment vehicles with those partners. In either event, each
investment, it is stated, will be structured to limit the exposure of AYP to excessive liabilities and to allow AYP
a role in the direction of the business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allegheny states that it now has no proposed specific investment in mind and that AYP shall make no investment without
prior Commission approval. Allegheny also states that neither it nor AYP will, without Commission approval, finance
the future acquisition by AYP of an EWG or new technologies company.

One section of the 1990 Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requires States to achieve and maintain a 15% reduction
in their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions level below the 1990 base year level by 1996 in non-attainment
areas within the individual States. States are presently developing methods to achieve required compliance levels.
One State recently passed state regulations that will require vessels that have carried certain VOC cargoes and are
being gas-freed and/or cleaned to utilize a marine vapor control system or an alternate means of control approved
by the State at the tank vessel cleaning facility. It is anticipated other States will develop similar regulations
as a means of complying with the CAA Amendments for their States. The purpose of this meeting is to continue reviewing
tank vessel cleaning facility gas-freeing and tank cleaning operations in order to evaluate potential control technologies
that will allow these facilities to meet air quality emissions standards while ensuring a high level of safety for
facility and vessel personnel is maintained. As a result of this review, the Subcommittee will develop recommendations
for revising existing safety guidelines for tank vessel cleaning facilities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->
Mormac Marine Transport, Inc.; Application for Written Permission Pursuant to Section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine
Act, 1936, as Amended
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mormac Marine Transport, Inc. (Mormac), a subsidiary of Mormac Marine Group, Inc. (Mormac Marine), by application
of May 9, 1994, requests, pursuant to section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (Act) and Article
II&hyph;13 of Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreements, Contracts MA/MSB&hyph;295 (a), (b), and (c) (ODSAs),
written permission for (1) James R. Barker and Paul R. Tregurtha (and members of their immediate families), to own
a pecuniary interest in Moran Towing Corporation (Moran) and (2) Messrs. Barker and Tregurtha and members of their
immediate families to serve as officers and directors of Moran and any of its subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moran provides domestic coastwise transportation services and performs harbor ship work with tugboats, more particularly
described below. Mormac is of the view that docking and undocking ships within harbors is not subject to section 805(a),
noting that that type of service was within section 803 of the Act, which was repealed by the Merchant Marine Act of 1970.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mormac points out that it currently has approval for common ownership, officers and directors of Mormac Marine and
its subsidiaries as well as the Interlake Steamship Company and Lakes Shipping Company, Inc., both of which are involved
in the domestic coastwise Great Lakes service. Mormac needs approval for the acquisition of Moran for the brief period
of time remaining under the terms of Mormac's ODSAs. Mormac's ODSAs will terminate in December 1995, June 1996, and
February 1997, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the letter of intent, Messrs. Barker and Tregurtha, members of their immediate families, and Lakes Shipping
Company, Inc. (which itself is owned in substantial part by the Barker and Tregurtha families) will be purchasing
the outstanding stock of Moran.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Mormac, Moran and its subsidiaries are currently involved principally in the operation of tug boats
from eight ports on the U.S. east and gulf coasts used to dock and undock ships and also tow barges and other vessels.
Moran also uses its own tugs and barges to transport cargoes along the east and gulf coasts and dry bulk cargoes both
in the coastwise and worldwide trades. The Moran fleet currently consists of 54 tugs and 12 barges. Moran also indirectly
owns a 20-percent interest in tankers transporting crude oil from Alaska to the continental U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mormac states that Moran and Mormac are both U.S. citizens within the definition of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916,
and section 905(a) of the Act, and will continue to be so after the consummation of the proposed transactions. Following
the change in ownership, Mormac claims that Moran will continue to be involved in the same domestic coastwise and worldwide
service in which it is currently engaged, with the possibility of future modifications and expansion to these services
as circumstances warrant and permit. Mormac feels that it is essential that Moran be permitted freely to move tugboats
and barges among the several services in which they are presently employed and into new services if conditions and
circumstances so dictate. It is also important that Moran be able to expand services geographically within the regions
currently being served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mormac maintains that the ownership of Moran by Messrs. Tregurtha and Barker and their involvement in the management
of Moran will not result in any change in competitive conditions for U.S.-flag vessels providing domestic coastwise
marine transportation and harbor tug services or for U.S.-flag vessels providing tanker services from Alaska to
the continental U.S. The only effect of the proposed transaction will be a change in the ownership of Moran. Furthermore,
it is expected that the management of Moran will remain with Moran after the acquisition. Messrs. Tregurtha and Barker
will serve as Chairman and Vice Chairman thereof, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moran and Mormac are, and will remain, according to Mormac, entirely separate corporate entities that will maintain
separate and discrete accounts so there will be no issue of a subsidy leakage or diversion of subsidy. Following the
consummation of the proposed transaction, Mormac and Moran will consent to examination of their books and records
to the extent necessary to establish that there is no diversion of subsidy. Mormac will receive no benefit from the
operations of Moran and Moran will receive no benefit from the operations of Mormac.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moran believes that no U.S.-flag competitor of Moran will be subject to unfair competition nor will the ownership
of Moran by Messrs. Barker and Tregurtha and their family members be prejudicial to the purposes and policies of the
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mormac contends that no disputed issue of material fact is anticipated by a transaction that simply changes ownership
of a company providing existing services. Any competitive condition that existed before the transaction will exist
after the transaction. Mormac believes that no credible argument of leakage can be raised, eliminating the possibility
of any argument that a change in ownership and the continuation of current services will result in unfair competition
to any U.S.-flag vessel. Under these circumstances, should there be any request to intervene in this application,
no issue is expected by Mormac to be raised that could not be addressed on the basis of available information provided
to the record or subject to official notice and certainly no issue that would involve the submission of substantial
evidence, either written or oral.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Mormac's view, approval of this application is also entirely consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act.
This acquisition will be a significant expansion of Messrs. Barker's and Tregurtha's U.S.-flag fleets and a strong
statement of continuing support for the U.S. merchant marine by individuals who have a long history in and are well
respected by the maritime industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mormac requests the scope of domestic operations permitted under the ODSAs be modified to allow ownership of Moran
by Lakes Shipping Company, Inc., Messrs. Barker and Tregurtha and members of their immediate families, as well as
to allow Messrs. Barker and Tregurtha to serve as officers and directors of both Mormac and Moran, with Moran continuing
to be involved in its current services (modified and expanded as circumstances warrant and permit).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This application may be inspected in the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person, firm, or corporation
having any interest in such application within the meaning of section 805(a) of the Act and desiring to submit comments
concerning the application, must file written comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration,
together with petition for leave to intervene, Room 7300, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC
20590. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on May 24, 1994. The petition shall state clearly and concisely
the grounds of interest, and the alleged facts relied on for relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no petition for leave to intervene is received within the specified time or if it is determined that petitions filed
do not demonstrate sufficient interest to warrant a hearing, the Maritime Administration will take such action as
may be deemed appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event petitions regarding the relevant section 805(a) issues are received from parties with standing to be
heard, a hearing will be held, the purpose of which will be to receive evidence under section 805(a) relative to whether
the proposed operations (a) could result in unfair competition to any person, firm, or corporation operating exclusively
in the coastwise or intercoastal service, or (b) would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act relative
to domestic trade operations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency (USIA) proposes the development of
a multi-phased exchange program for legislative staff of four francophone African countries. The participating
countries are Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Niger The project should introduce participants to the responsibilities
of various professional staff in conducting the business of a legislature, emphasizing professional non-partisan
roles. The project may address a wide range of administrative, legal, fiscal, and research services or concentrate
on a few of notable priority. It also should illustrate the role of information resources in conducting policy analysis
and drafting legislation as well as the role of archival materials in establishing the legislature's official legal
record. The project should facilitate access to resource materials to promote the the study of the legislative process
and should law the foundation for collaboration between U.S. and African legislatures and professional support
organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A U.S. not-for-profit institution will design and execute the program and select the American presenters. The institution
should demonstrate success in coordinating international exchange programs for senior-level foreign participants.
The applicant institution should have substantive working relationships with U.S. public and private sector organizations
involved with legislative affairs and the professional development of key staff in Congress or in state assemblies.
The program will begin in the fall of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested applicants are urged to read the complete Request for Proposals (RFP) announcement before addressing
inquires to the Office. After the RFP deadline, the Office of Citizen Exchanges may not discuss this competition in
any way with applicants until the final decisions are made.

Project Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several francophone African countries are strengthening their democratic institutions, having recently completed
the transition to a representative system of government. National legislatures in these countries have the opportunity
to gain greater independence, develop more effective legislation and take steps to serve more forcefully as a balance
to executive power. The viability and institutional independence of these legislative bodies could be enhanced
by the services of trained staff prepared to play a support role for lawmakers and the legislative process. Legislative
staff also are well paced to provide continuity regardless of the legislature's partisan make-up or the political
fortunes of elected representatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the United States, Congress and state legislatures employ professional staff to conduct research, draft legislation,
analyze budgets, maintain records, monitor compliance with legislation and perform other duties. In many cases,
professional staff provide these services on a non-partisan basis. For example, on Capitol Hill, the Office of the
Legislative Counsel assists committees in drafting and amending legislation. The clerk of the House and secretary
of the Senate, selected by the majority party, assist in processing legislation and performing various reporting
functions. The House Office of the Law Revision Counsel updates and publishes an official classification of U.S.
laws. In drafting bills, lawmakers rely on non-partisan support organizations such as the Congressional Research
Service, which analyzes public policy issues, and the Congressional Budget Office, which provides analyses of fiscal
issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While not every one of these services is directly applicable to needs in Africa, they reflect the evolving demands
placed upon the U.S. Congress and could help guide efforts to promote professional development of legislative staff
in Africa. The legislatures in Mali, Niger and Benin are drafting landmark legislation aimed at implementing political
and economic reforms. Legislators and observers have identified the need for assistance in bill drafting, improving
legislative procedures and developing strategies to make better use of legislative archives. In most cases specialized
training is not available, and staff could benefit from a project aimed at enhancing their capabilities to assist
lawmakers fulfill their mandates. Legislators and staff also are seeking reference materials to support their legislative
initiatives. In Cote d'Ivoire, where the ruling party has held power for 30 years, parliamentary elections scheduled
for 1995 could alter the political landscape. Legislative aides in Cote d'Ivoire, and all these states, could benefit
from a program that demonstrates the role of professionalism and nonpartisanship in conducting the business of the
legislature.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the USIA Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, all programs sponsored
by that Bureau must be balanced and non-partisan in nature and representative of the diversity of American political,
social and cultural life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will give careful consideration to proposals which demonstrate: (1) In-depth, substantive knowledge of management
and policy development issues relative to the legislative process;

(2) First-hand connections with appropriate U.S. public and private sector organizations and institutions involved
in legislative affairs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The capacity to organize and manage international exchange programs, including appropriate orientation for
the participants, handling of pre-departure arrangements and monitoring and problem-solving in such programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA is especially interested in multi-phase programs in which the phases build on one another and lay the groundwork
for new and long-term relationships between American and African professionals. Proposals which are overly ambitious
and those which are very general will not be competitive. Office of Citizen Exchanges grants are not given to support
projects whose focus is limited to technical matters, or for scholarly research projects, developing publications
for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchanges, film festivals, or exhibits. Neither does
the Office of Citizen Exchanges provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester or more) academic studies.
Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and may have different application requirements as well as different objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programming elements might include workshops or seminars overseas led by American experts, a study tour in the U.S.
for selected African participants, U.S.-based internships, and specialized American consultancies overseas.
A planning visit overseas by the American organizer can also be considered if crucial to successful development and
implementation of the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection of Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S.-based phase of the project should be designed for legislative staff from Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Niger,
probably totalling about 12 persons. Participants should have professional responsibilities related to the operation
of the national legislature. USIS personnel overseas will select the African participants, although recommendations
from the grantee institution are welcome. USIS offices will facilitate the issuance of visas and can also help with
the distribution of program-related materials to African participants. Two U.S. State Department interpreters
and one escort officer will be available for a U.S. study tour. For the program phases in Africa, the grantee institution
will select the American presenters in consultation with USIA. American presenters conducting in-country activities
should be French-fluent.

Programming Suggestions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project should include at least one phase for African participants in the U.S. and at least one phase for
American specialists in Africa. The following ideas should serve not as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for development
of an original program design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project should include formats which maximize interaction between the delegates and the speakers/presenters.
The program design should provide adequate time for delegates to meet individually with American professionals
who have similar interests and specializations. It is preferred, though not essential, that presenters be familiar
with issues pertaining to the political process in the participating African countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. Study Tour Phase
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. study tour (approximately 3&hyph;4 weeks) could begin with an introduction to the U.S. Congress and its relationship
to the other branches of the national government. However, the program should focus on one or more state legislatures
whose scope and structure offer comparisons more relevant to African legislative bodies. Participants would learn
about the professional duties of various legislative aides, as well as support staff including legal counsels, researchers,
analysts, archivists, clerks and administrators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants might also benefit from observing the activities of lawmakers' personal staff who perform functions
such as constituent services and media relations as well as committee staff who assist in setting agendas, organizing
hearings and drafting legislation. Activities should stress the importance of professionalism in enhancing the
long-term viability of the legislature and consider the impact of partisan politics on the professional staff's
pursuit of its responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants also should study a variety of archival materials and their usage in supporting the legislative process
and establishing the official record. Activities should help guide efforts to formulate appropriate strategies
for handling archival materials in the participants' home countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase in Africa
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is recommended that the grantee institution organize a series of workshops to be conducted in the participating
African countries. The workshops would bring together legislators and legislative staff to develop strategies
aimed at strengthening the institutional capabilities of the legislature. This might include creating new staffing
patterns, improving communication techniques, or revising job responsibilities. The U.S. presenters would also
examine archives and advise participants on developing appropriate archiving systems. The U.S. presenters would
conduct activities in French.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The themes, objectives and design of the activities in Africa would most likely be based on discussions among the grantee
institution, E/P, USIS posts and key players in the legislative process in the participating countries. This multi-phased
exchange program should promote development of institutional linkages designed to advance the study of the legislative
process. E/P encourages applicant institutions to consider strategies to facilitate access to information resources
focusing on democratic institution building. This material might include reference books, periodicals, bibliographies,
handbooks for elected representatives and lists of organizations that could offer assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grantee institution's responsibilities include: selecting speakers, themes and topics for discussion; organizing
a coherent progression of activities; orienting and debriefing participants; providing any support materials;
providing all travel arrangements, lodging and other logistical arrangements for the African participants, escort
interpreters and U.S. presenters who travel to Africa; and overseeing the project on a daily basis to achieve maximum
program effectiveness. The grantee institution is responsible for coordinating plans and implementation with
P/E, participating USIS posts, and any African co-host institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the start of each phase, the grantee institution will conduct an orientation session for the delegation. At the
conclusion, the institution will conduct participant evaluations and submit to E/P a final program report summarizing
the entire project and resulting organizational links. To prepare the participants for their U.S. experience, E/P
encourages the grantee organization to forward to participants a set of preliminary materials outlining the basic
principles of representative government, the role of professional legislative staff and other appropriate background
information about the project. E/P will ask African participants to prepare brief outlines describing their own
particular interests in these areas. The grantee institution should brief the American presenters on the African
delegates' backgrounds, interests and concerns.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultation with the participating USIS posts in the development of the project proposal is encouraged. Letters
of commitment from participating U.S. institutions would enhance a proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA also encourages the development of specialized written materials to enhance this professional development
program. In developing written materials, consideration should be given to their wider use in Africa, beyond the
immediate training at hand. USIA is interested in organizations' ideas on how to ``reuse'' specialized materials
by providing them to universities and libraries or other institutions for use by a larger audience. If not already
available, glossaries of specialized terms should be developed. However, please note that, according to current
USIA regulations, materials developed with USIA funds may not be distributed in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Selection of a grantee institution is based on the substantive nature
of the program proposal; the applicant's professional capability to carry the program through to a successful conclusion;
and cost effectiveness, including in-kind contributions and the ability to keep overhead costs at a minimum. USIA
will consider providing funding up to approximately $160,000, but organizations with less than four years of successful
experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000, and their budget submissions should
correspond to this limitation. USIA will consider funding the following costs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport fees); ground transportation costs;

2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Per diem: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For foreign participants during activities in the United States, organizations have the option of using a flat rate
of $140/day or the published Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) per diem rates of individual American cities.

3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Escort-interpreters: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interpretation for U.S.-based programs is provided by the State Department's Language Services Division. Typically,
delegations ranging from 8&hyph;12 participants require two simultaneous interpreters and one escort officer.
Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem rate for each State Department escort/interpreter,
as well as home-program-home air fare of $400 per interpreter and any U.S. travel expenses during the program itself.
Salary expenses are covered centrally and are not part of the applicant's budget proposal. USIA grants do not pay for
foreign interpreters to accompany delegations during travel to or from their home country. Interpreters are not
available for U.S.-based internship activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Book and cultural allowances: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants are entitled to a one-time book allowance of $50 plus a cultural allowance of $150 per person during programs
taking place in the United States. U.S. staff do not receive these benefits. Escort interpreters are reimbursed for
actual cultural expenses up to $150.00.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consultants: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consultants may be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally should not
exceed $250/day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) should be
included in the proposal.

Materials development: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

10. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. E/P would be especially
interested in proposals which demonstrate a program vision which goes well beyond that which can be supported by the
requested USIA grant and which would try to use a USIA grant to leverage additional funding from other sources to support
elements of the broader program plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution
to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The
basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110,
Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient
does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution
will be reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution.

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The University Democratization in South Africa Program focuses on education reform to enable students, faculty
and administrators of selected South African universities to shift from the confrontation of an apartheid culture
to the cooperation implicit in a democratic society. This project will provide university student leaders and university
facility and administrative staff tasked with student affairs management with training in conflict resolution
and in university administration. The South African institutions which will participate are the University of Fort
Hare, the University of Zululand, the University of the North and the University of the Western Cape.

Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the U.S., participation in the program is open to accredited two-year and four-year colleges and universities,
including graduate schools. Consortia of universities and/or community colleges, individually or as systems,
are also eligible. In South Africa, participation is limited to the University of the Western Cape, the University
of Fort Hare, the University of the North, and the University of Zululand. Proposals from a consortium may be submitted
by a member institution with authority to represent the consortium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants representing the U.S. institution traveling under USIA grant support must be U.S. citizens. Participants
representing South African institutions must be citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of South Africa.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency invites proposals from eligible Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) and other institutions
in the U.S. with significant minority student enrollment. Consortia of universities including such institutions
are also encouraged to apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Project Design
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The project should begin with a conference in South Africa bringing together American experts and South Africans
students, instructors, and staff to provide initial training in student affairs/educational administration and
conflict resolution and to develop subsequent programming. Incorporating South African citizens' aspirations
and objectives into the overall training plan is crucial to the success of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second phase of the project would focus on formal training at the U.S. host institution. The administering U.S.
institution, in consultation with the United States Information Service offices (USIS) in Pretoria, and the project
participants would select a group of South Africans to come to the U.S. institution for courses, workshops, and guided
research on student politics in democratic societies, managing change in educational institutions, conflict resolution,
and general management skills. Research might focus upon creating a history of the South African student movement,
outlining its role in democratizing educational institutions, and devising models for exercising student power
in a democratic South Africa. The U.S. academic experience should be from six weeks to one semester in length. Longer
stays for the purpose of pursuing an advanced degree will not be sponsored. Participants may enroll in established
courses at the administering institution. However, the institution should also be able to organize customized training
sessions for the group participants. The final format of the academic program will depend upon consultation among
the U.S. and South African participants at the initial conference in South Africa.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final segment of the grant would be follow-up workshops organized by the South African participants at their home
institutions with facilitation and consultation from the U.S. instructors in the program. The U.S. institution
may also propose to assist with publication and dissemination of findings developed during the U.S. training program
and the final South African workshops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life.

Budget
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Competition for USIA funding is keen. The selection of a grantee institution will depend on program substance, cross-cultural
sensitivity and ability to carry out the program successfully. Since USIA cooperative assistance constitutes only
a portion of total project funding, proposals should list and provide evidence of other anticipated sources of financial
and in-kind support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal's cost-effectiveness, including in-kind contributions and ability to keep administrative costs low,
is a major consideration in the review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding for this grant is limited to $250,000. Preference will be given to the most competitive budget proposals.
Qualified organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange
programs are limited to grants of $60,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the following described applications for Federal financial assistance are accepted
for filing under provisions of title III, part IV, of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 390&hyph;393,
397) and in accordance with 15 CFR part 2301. All of the applications listed in this section were received by March 17,
1994. The effective date of acceptance of these proposals, unless otherwise indicated herein, is ``Dated Received''.
Applications are listed by their State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acceptance of applications for filing is a procedure designed for making preliminary determinations of eligibility
and for providing the opportunity for public comment on applications. Acceptance of an application does not preclude
subsequent return or disapproval of an application if it is found to be not in accordance with the provisions of either
the Act or 15 CFR part 2301, or if the applicant fails to file any additional information requested by the Public Telecommunications
Facilities Program (PTFP). Acceptance for filing does not ensure that an application will be funded; it merely qualifies
that application to compete for funding with other applications which have also been accepted for filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested party may file comments with the Agency supporting or opposing an application and setting forth the
grounds for support or opposition. Such comments must contain a certification that a copy of the comments have been
delivered to the applicant. Comments must be sent to the address listed in 15 CFR 2301.5(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will incorporate all comments from the public and any replies from the applicant in the applicant's official
file.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is announcing the availability of $25 million for Fiscal Year 1994 under the Public and Indian Housing Tenant Opportunities
Program (TOP). HUD has reinvented resident management and created the TOP which expands the range of the resident
managed activities so that resident organizations can set priorities based on the needs in their communities. The
program provides assistance to resident grantees, including Resident Councils (RCs), Resident Management Corporations
(RMCs), Resident Organizations (ROs), National Resident Organizations (NRO), Statewide Resident Organizations
(SRO), and Regional Resident Organizations (RRO), to fund training and other tenant opportunities, such as the formation
of such entities, identification of the relevant social support needs, and securing of such support for residents
of public and Indian housing. The NOFA discusses eligibility, funding amounts, selection criteria, how to apply
for funding, and the selection process.

B. Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 122 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;42, approved February 5, 1988)
amended the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) by adding a new section 20. In part, section 20 states as its purpose the
encouragement of ``increased resident management of public housing projects [and the provision of funding] *&blank;*&blank;*
to promote formation and development of resident management entities'' (Sec. 20(a)). Under section 20(f)(1):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[The Secretary shall provide financial assistance to resident management corporations or resident councils that
obtain, by contract or otherwise, technical assistance for the development of resident management entities, including
the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly formed or existing entities,
the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects, and the securing of such support.]

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 20(f)(2), this financial assistance may not exceed $100,000 with respect to any public and Indian housing
project, and subsection (f)(3) limits the assistance within the context of funds available under section 14 of the
1937 Act (Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program). Section 20 is implemented in 24 CFR part 964 and, for Native
American Programs, in 24 CFR part 905, subpart O. The rules set forth, among other things, the policies, procedures,
and requirements of resident participation and management of public and Indian housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1988, $2.5 million was awarded to 27 resident organizations; in FY 1989, $2.5 million was awarded to 35 resident
organizations; in FY 1990, $2.4 million was awarded to 37 resident organizations; in FY 1991, $4.9 million was awarded
to 96 organizations; in FY 1992 $4.6 million was awarded to 94 organizations; and in FY 1993, $4.7 million was awarded
to 94 organizations. In FY 1994, $25 million is available for technical assistance and training for activities under
the TOP program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today, 383 resident groups throughout the country are in training under this public and Indian housing program. HUD
supports the resident management movement, as well as other self-sufficiency and improvement programs designed
to benefit public and Indian housing residents. The Office of Resident Initiatives in Public and Indian Housing has
been created to deliver a variety of resident initiative programs, with assistance from a network of Resident Initiatives
Coordinators (RICs) or Community Relations and Involvement Specialists (CRIs) in HUD's field structure. The RICs/CRIs
are available to provide direct assistance to residents and resident groups interested in resident initiatives
programs.

C. Key Features of This NOFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) This NOFA announces the new Tenant Opportunity Program (TOP), which was formerly the Public and Indian Housing
Resident Management Program. Resident organizations and housing authorities across the country overwhelmingly
requested that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) revamp the Resident Management Program to meet
the needs in their communities for business development, education, job training and development, social services,
and opportunities for other self-help initiatives. In complying with the request of residents and housing authorities,
HUD has reinvented resident management and created the TOP. The new TOP will enable resident organizations to establish
priorities based on the needs in their public and Indian housing communities aimed at furthering economic lift and
independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority for the TOP program comes from Section 20 of the 1937 Act; section 20(f) authorizes technical assistance
and training. Financial assistance in the form of technical assistance grants is provided by the Secretary to resident
grantees to prepare for management activities in their housing development (hereinafter referred to as TOP technical
assistance grants). Technical assistance grants are available for ``the development of resident management entities,
including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly formed or existing
entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects and the securing
of such support.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TOP technical assistance grants prepare residents to manage their projects or portions of their projects. The results
are significant and multifaceted. For example, resident-managed activities have resulted in economic development,
resident self-sufficiency, improved living conditions, and enhanced social services for residents (i.e., child
care and other youth projects). TOP will provide public and Indian housing residents the opportunity to be trained
and move toward a responsible role in their community. The training will aim to enhance the functioning of the resident
council as well as gain skills to engage in resident managed activities in its community. TOP will strongly encourage
resident organizations to develop a partnership with a public or Indian housing authority (hereafter referred to
as ``HA''). Secretary Cisneros is committed to building a real partnership among HAs, residents, and HUD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The ``Mini Grants'' are eliminated this year for the purpose of streamlining program requirements. RCs/RMCs/ROs
that have been in existence for several years or that were recently formed may receive up to $100,000 for start-up activities,
as well as for community organizing, participation in public and Indian housing and community affairs, and training
in other tenant opportunities activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All resident grantees that are selected for funding (including additional funding grantees) will access the
grant funds through a line of credit control system (LOCCS), as explained in Section I.D, ``Funding,'' of this NOFA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An application kit is required as the formal submission to apply for funding. The kit includes information on the
preparation of a Work Plan and Budget for activities proposed by the applicant. This process facilitates the expeditious
execution of a TOP Technical Assistance Grant (TOP TAG) for those applicants that are selected to receive funding.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All HOPE I applicants' applications will be screened. A cross-check will be made against the HOPE I Planning grants
and HOPE I Implementation grants, to assure compliance with section 20(f)(4) of the 1937 Act, which states: ``The
Secretary may not provide financial assistance under this subsection to any resident management corporation or
resident council with respect to which assistance for the development or formation of such entity is provided under
title III.'' HOPE I Planning and Implementation grantees were required to propose plans to establish a RC, RMC, or
cooperative association where one did not exist for the proposed homeownership site, including the development
or formation of that entity. In addition, HOPE I Full Planning and Implementation grant applicants were expected
to include in their applications all eligible activities necessary to make their proposed homeownership program
feasible (even if some of the proposed activities were to be carried out with non-HOPE I funds, such as resident management
funds). Consequently, in reviewing Tenant Opportunities Program grant applications, the following rules apply:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant for TOP funds that has received a HOPE I Full Planning or Implementation grant (as a lead or joint applicant)
may not also receive a TOP grant, unless the applicant proposed in its HOPE I application to use resident management
funding to carry out those activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rule 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant for TOP funds that has received a HOPE I Mini Planning grant (as a lead or joint applicant) may not receive
a TOP grant for any activity proposed for funding in the HOPE I grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) All applicants will have an opportunity to correct technical deficiencies in this application submission as
provided for in this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, $25 million is being made available on a competitive basis under this NOFA to resident grantees that submit
timely applications and are selected for funding. Section 20 provides that not more than an aggregate of $100,000
may be approved with respect to any TOP project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the $25 million total current funds, $1 million will be awarded to National Resident Organizations (NROs), Statewide
Resident Organizations (SROs), and Regional Resident Organizations (RROs) to provide technical assistance to
public and Indian housing residents desiring either to establish an RC/RMC/RO where one does not exist or organize
an inactive RC/RMC/RO. The awards will be competitive, using the Rating Factors in Section I.M of this NOFA, and applicants
must meet eligibility requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the remainder of the available funding, the Department will be providing two kinds of grants: (1) Basic Grants;
and (2) Additional Grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Basic Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All resident grantees that are selected for funding (including additional funding grantees) will access the grant
funds through a line of credit control system (LOCCS), based on the line items approved in the work plan/budget. To
monitor and ensure the progress of the funded resident grantees this year, each resident grantee will be allowed to
draw down up to 10% of the grant funds to begin implementing Tasks 1 and 2 of the workplan. If the resident grantee has
reached the 10% limit and all activities set forth in Tasks 1 and 2 are not completed, the resident grantee will not be
allowed to draw down any additional funds until all activities are completed. The local field office will monitor
this progress through the semiannual progress reports that are required to be submitted by the resident grantees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCs/RMCs/ROs selected for funding in FYs 1988&hyph;1993 (including a mini-grant for start-up activities) that
received less than a total of $100,000 may apply for an Additional Grant not to exceed (including previous grants)
the total statutory maximum of $100,000. A RC/RMC/RO considered for additional funding will be asked to demonstrate
progress based on its Work Plan previously approved by HUD. All additional grantees will be evaluated to determine
if Tasks 1 and 2 of the workplan have been completed. If the tasks are not completed, the grantee will follow the same
procedures as the Basic Grantees and, upon completion of the tasks, proceed to complete all other tasks listed in the
workplan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This year applicants will not be disqualified for funding if all of the activities identified in the work plan are not
completed. However, applicants applying for additional grants will receive a higher score if the RC/RMC/RO can demonstrate
the accomplishment of all of the following activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Developed an active community organization that includes democratically elected officers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Completed the first phase of the Board and Leadership Training provided by the consultant/trainer that is selected

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant awards will be made through a TOP Technical Assistance Grant (TOP TAG), which defines the legal framework for
the relationship between HUD and a resident grantee for the proposed activities approved for funding. The TAG will
contain all applicable requirements, including administrative requirements such as progress reports, a final
report, a final audit, and accessing the Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) to draw down funds. All necessary materials

Consistent with this NOFA, HUD may direct a HA to notify its existing RCs/RMCs/ROs, as well as NROs, SROs, and RROs,
of this funding opportunity. It is important for residents to be advised that even in the absence of a RC/RMC/RO, the
opportunity exists to establish a RC/RMC/RO. If no RC/RMC/RO exists for any of the developments, HUD encourages a
HA to post this NOFA in a prominent location within the HA's main office, as well as in each development's office.

 HA Support.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) HUD is in full support of a cooperative relationship between each RC/RMC/RO and its HA. A resident organization
is urged to involve its HA in the application planning and submission process. This can be achieved through meetings
to discuss resident concerns and objectives and how best to transfer these objectives into activities in the application.
The RC/RMC/RO is also encouraged to obtain a letter of support from the HA indicating to what extent the HA supports
the proposed activities listed by the RC/RMC/RO and how the HA will assist the RC/RMC/RO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A RC/RMC/RO is encouraged to include an indication of support and assistance by development residents and Board
(e.g., RC/RMC/RO Board resolution, copies of minutes, letters, petition, etc.); the neighboring community; and
local public or private organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Submission.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The original and 2 copies of the Application must be submitted. The Appendix lists addresses of HUD Field/Native American
Program Offices that will accept a completed application. The application must be received by the local HUD Field
Office no later than 4 p.m. (local time) on the deadline date listed in the application kit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, any application that is received after the deadline date
will be considered ineligible. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their
materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related
problems. HUD will date-stamp incoming applications to evidence (timely or late) receipt, and, upon request, will
provide an acknowledgement of receipt. Facsimile and telegraphic applications are not authorized and will not be
considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD also encourages an applicant to submit a copy of the application to the HA for the jurisdiction in which the RC/RMC/RO

A. Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) RC/RMC/RO grantees are required to have training, and NRO/SRO/RRO grantees are requested to provide training,
in the areas listed below, but the amount and scope of training will depend on the resident groups' goals. For example,
training required to assume property management is more extensive than training needed to establish a landscaping
enterprise. The required training areas are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) HUD regulations and policies governing the operation of low-income housing, which includes the part 900 series
of 24 CFR and Section 3 (of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, 12 U.S.C. 1701u) and other Fair Housing Act
requirements, and applicable civil rights laws for Public Housing or for Indian Housing (24 CFR part 905);

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Financial management, including budgetary and accounting principles and techniques, in accordance with Federal
guidelines, including OMB Circulars A&hyph;110 and A&hyph;122, which contain Federal administrative requirements
for grants, and OMB Circular A&hyph;133, relating to audit requirements for nonprofit organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Capacity building to develop the necessary skills to assume management responsibilities at the project; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Based on the goals of the RC/RMC/RO, property management and/or any TOP activity training that is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each grantee must ensure that this training is provided by a qualified housing management specialist (Consultant/Trainer),
community development specialist, the HA, or other local/tribal agencies knowledgeable about the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. OMB Procurement Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The resident grantees must follow Circular A&hyph;110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants, and
other agreements with recipients of Federal funds. OMB Circular A&hyph;110 prescribes standards and policies essential
to the proper execution of procurement transactions, including standards of conduct for resident grantees' employees,
officers, or agents engaged in procurement actions to avoid any conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A resident grantee may use two methods in obtaining consultant services: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A ``full service'' approach may be used where the applicant solicits competitive proposals for assisting in the
preparation of the application, with inclusion of the consultant work if the applicant is selected to receive a grant.
The evaluation criteria in the solicitation must address the qualifications and experience of prospective consultants
for all tasks (the contract may stipulate that in the event that the application is not approved, the consultant is
not entitled to any payment); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Separation of Application Preparation from Consultant Work After Grant Award. This approach allows an applicant
to solicit competitive proposals and contract with a Consultant-Trainer/Housing Management Specialist for the
development of an application for technical assistance funding. If the applicant is selected for funding, the Consultant-Trainer/Housing
Management Specialist must compete along with other prospective Consultant-Trainer/Housing Management Specialists
through an open and free procurement process for a training and technical assistance contract. This will eliminate
any competitive advantage attained by the Consultant-Trainer/Housing Management Specialist who was awarded a
contract for the development of the application/Work Plan and Budget.

IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will notify an applicant in writing of any technical deficiencies in the application. Any deficiency capable
of cure will involve only items not necessary for HUD to assess the merits of an application against the Rating Factors
specified in this NOFA. For example, signatures needed on certain forms, certifications, workplan, budget, and
other required forms may be considered curable deficiencies. The applicant must submit corrections within 14 calendar
days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any technical deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the application due date, applicants will not have an opportunity to submit independently information omitted
from the Application Kit that directly relates to the evaluation factors contained in the subheading ``Rating Factors''
of this NOFA so as to enhance the merits of the application. HUD encourages all applicants to submit all documents with
their application before the due date, so that applicants will not be affected by the technical deficiency period.

V. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Freedom of Information Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications submitted in response to this NOFA are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
To assist the Department in determining whether to release information contained in an application in the event a
FOIA request is received, an applicant may, through clear earmarking or otherwise, indicate those portions of its
application that it believes should not be disclosed. The applicant's views will be used solely to aid the Department
in preparing its response to a FOIA request; however, the Department is required by the FOIA to make an independent
evaluation of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD suggests that an applicant provide a basis, when possible, for its belief that confidential treatment is appropriate;
general assertions or blanket requests for confidentiality, without more information, are of limited value to the
Department in making determinations concerning the release of information under FOIA. The Department is required
to segregate disclosable information from non-disclosable items, so an applicant should be careful to identify
each portion of the application for which confidential treatment is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the presence or absence of comments or earmarking regarding confidential information
will have no bearing on the evaluation of applications submitted in response to this solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(b) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to technical assistance and, therefore,
are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that this notice does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD
policies or programs will result from promulgation of this notice, as those policies and programs related to family
concerns.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their
political subdivisions, or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review
under the Order. The NOFA will fund technical assistance and activities for resident management and other empowerment
initiatives of public and Indian housing. It will have no meaningful impact on States or their political subdivisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (HUD
Reform Act), HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant
to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these documentation and public access requirements.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, and the notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

F. Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons
not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation
implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4 (see 56 FR 22088, May 13, 1991). In accordance with the requirements
of section 103, HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained
by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning
funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for
assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4.
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.)

G. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.
3531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial
assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those
who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those
who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the
award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance
received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 is implemented in 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of that part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD)
(these are not toll-free numbers). Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD
office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 701) requires grantees of federal agencies to certify that they will
provide drug-free workplaces. Each potential recipient under this NOFA must certify that it will comply with drug-free
workplace requirements in accordance with the Act and with HUD's rules at 24 CFR part 24, subpart F.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is announcing the availability of $5 million in funding for Fiscal Year 1994 for a Youth Development Initiative
under the Family Investment Center Program (FIC). The Youth Development Initiative under FIC will provide five grants
for innovative violence abatement strategies that have been developed by youth for public housing. The Youth Development
Initiative furthers the mission of Operation Safe Home, a major Clinton Administration Initiative that addresses
the larger problem of violence in America's low-income communities. The Youth Development Initiative will provide
young individuals (ages 13&hyph;25), including noncustodial parents with child support agreements for children
that are public housing residents and who would be capable of meeting their obligations by being provided such services,
with better access to comprehensive education and employment opportunities and supportive services. The grants
will be for up to three to five years in duration, depending upon the activities undertaken, and will involve youth
as active partners, to provide leadership opportunities and improve the capacity for long-term training and services
for young residents. The Department has proposed regulations for this program as part of the Tenant Participation
and Tenant Opportunity (TOP) rule, published on April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18666).

I. Purpose and Substantive Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment
Centers (FIC). The Department has proposed regulations for this program as part of the Tenant Participation and Tenant
Opportunity (TOP) rule, published on April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18666). This NOFA is being issued in conformity with the
statutory requirements of FIC, in order to make funding available as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers published on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9592), as
amended on April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18570), the Department announced the availability of $69 million for funding Family
Investment Center activities by public housing agencies (PHAs) or Indian housing authorities. In today's NOFA,
an additional $5 million is being made available to public housing agencies (PHAs) under FIC for the Youth Development
Initiative, to further advance the goals of FIC and the Administration's Operation Safe Home (OSH). If the entire
$5 million is not needed to carry out the Youth Development Initiative, remaining funds will be made available for
funding FIC activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FIC Youth Development Initiative grants will be targeted to assist youth in gaining access to education, employment,
and supportive services. HUD expects that this funding will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive supportive
services in contributing to the reduction of unemployment among our youth and crime and violence in public housing
communities. This Youth Development Initiative requires the design and implementation by the targeted youth in
partnership with the PHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each applicant may submit only one application under this NOFA. For this Youth Development Initiative, the maximum
grant amount per applicant under this NOFA is $1 million. Although both PHAs and IHAs are eligible applicants in the
main FIC NOFA published earlier, only PHAs may apply for the set-aside funds announced in this NOFA.

C. Overview and Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The stated purpose of Section 22 for FIC is:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]o provide families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to
achieve self-sufficiency and independence by: (a) developing facilities in or near public housing for training
and support services; (b) mobilizing public and private resources to expand and improve the delivery of such services;
(c) providing funding for such essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded; and (d) improving
the capacity of management to assess the training and service needs of families, coordinate the provision of training
and services that meet such needs, and ensure the long-term provision of such training and services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 22 is phrased in terms of ``families'' living in public housing, because of section 527 of the National
Affordable Housing Act (104 Stat. 4216; 42 U.S.C. 1437aa note) (NAHA), the definition of ``families'' may be used
interchangeably as individuals. This special Initiative is being made available to individuals (youths, ages 13&hyph;25),
including noncustodial parents with child support agreements for children living in public housing and who would
be made capable of meeting their obligations by being provided these services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department envisions that this Initiative under FIC will complement other youth programs, drug elimination
efforts, and Youth Sports activities to increase the rates of school completion, enrollment in advanced education,
or training and employment. PHAs that are recipients of or applicants for other programs with youth training opportunities
must coordinate this FIC Youth Development Initiative with these programs. As an incentive to becoming self-sufficient,
the earnings of public housing ``individuals/youths'' participating in this Youth Development Initiative shall
not be treated as income for the purpose of rent calculation, and services are not treated as income for the purposes
of any other program or provision of State or Federal law, including rent assistance, subject to the limitations set
out in section I.F(5), ``Treatment of Income,'' of this NOFA. This Initiative is administered by the Department's
Office of Resident Initiatives in the Office of Public and Indian Housing, with assistance from a network of Community
Relations and Involvement Specialists in HUD Field Offices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible Applicants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding for this program is limited to public housing authorities. The factors for award reflect that half of the points
possible are for the provision of supportive services, whether provided by the PHA or through partnerships with other
social service agencies. Facilities assisted shall be on or near the premises of public housing. For all families
using FIC services, other than eligible residents (as defined in Section I.D of this NOFA), any additional costs incurred
are to be borne by other resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible under this NOFA, a PHA cannot have serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit findings;
fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings; or Field Office management review findings. In addition,
the PHA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A PHA will be considered to
be in compliance if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil
rights laws unless the PHA is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct
the area(s) of noncompliance; (b) There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against
it by a private individual, unless the PHA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing
a HUD-approved resident selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement, designed to correct the area(s)
of noncompliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD has not deferred application processing by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's
Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and HUD's Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1) or under
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 CFR 8.57); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the PHA by the Department of Justice; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) There is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the PHA issued by the Secretary under section 810(g) of
the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To develop such a Youth Development Initiative, program funds may be used for the following activities to guarantee
youth access to comprehensive services: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The renovation, conversion, or combination of vacant dwelling units in a PHA development to create common areas
to accommodate the provision of supportive services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The renovation of existing common areas in a PHA development to accommodate the provision of supportive services;

of direct financial assistance administered by HUD provide, to the greatest extent feasible, opportunities for
job training and employment to lower income residents in connection with projects in their neighborhoods. For purposes
of training and employment, the PHA may offer opportunities to Section 3 residents in the following priority: (i)
Youth residents of the housing development for which the assistance is being provided; (ii) residents who reside
within a project area as defined in 24 CFR 135.15 and who reside in developments managed by the PHA that is expending
the assistance; and (iii) other residents of the Section 3 area. Therefore, at a minimum each PHA, and each of its contractors
and subcontractors receiving funds under this program, shall to the greatest extent feasible, employ PHA residents
to provide services and renovation or conversion work.

A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made for the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing
Family Investment Centers (FR&hyph;3397) in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section
102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (42 U.S.C. 4332) and applies equally to this NOFA. The
finding of no significant impact is available for public inspection and copying Monday through Friday during regular
business hours at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.

Federalism, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review
under the Order. The notice announces the availability of funds to provide youth living in public housing, or with
children living in public housing, with better access to education and job opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency
and independence.

The Family, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that this notice has potential for a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. The purpose of the notice is to provide funding to assist youth living in public housing, or with children
living in public housing, with better access to education and job opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and
independence, and, thus, could benefit families. However, because the impact on families is beneficial, no further
review is considered necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection
of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel for the program to which the question pertains.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD)
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

H. Freedom of Information Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications submitted in response to this NOFA are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
To assist the Department in determining whether to release information contained in an application in the event a
FOIA request is received, and applicant may, through clear earmarking, or otherwise, indicate those portions of
its application that it believes should not be disclosed. The applicant's views will be used solely to aid the Department
in preparing its response to a FOIA request; however, the Department is required by the FOIA to make an independent
evaluation of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD suggests that an applicant provide a basis, when possible, for its belief that confidential treatment is appropriate;
general assertions or blanket requests for confidentiality, without more information, are of limited value to the
Department in making determinations concerning the release of information under FOIA. The Department is required
to segregate disclosable information from nondisclosable items, so an applicant should be careful to identify each
portion of the application for which confidential treatment is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the presence or absence of comments or earmarking regarding confidential information
will have no bearing on the evaluation of applications submitted in response to this solicitation.

I. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the
Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

I. Purpose and Substantive Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 123 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (42 U.S.C. 5318 note) (section 123) authorized the
John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program. For Fiscal Year 1994, a total of $5 million has been appropriated for
this program under the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies
Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 18, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 123(e)(6)(D) permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to use no more than five
percent of the funds appropriated for administrative or other expenses in connection with the program. The remaining
funds are to be used to match monetary support raised over a one-year grant period from individuals, businesses, and
nonprofit or other organizations located within established neighborhood boundaries, and from neighborhood development
funding organizations. For purposes of this NOFA the term ``neighborhood development funding organization'' means:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A depository institution, the accounts of which are insured pursuant to the Federal Credit Union Act, and any subsidiary
(as such term is defined in section 3(w) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) thereof; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A depository institution holding company and any subsidiary (as such term is defined in section 3(w) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act) thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A company at least 75 percent of the common stock of which is owned by one or more insured depository institutions
or depository institution holding companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the program is to support eligible neighborhood development activities using cooperative efforts
and monetary contributions from local sources. The Federal funds are incentive funds to promote the development
of this concept and encourage neighborhood organizations to become more self-sufficient in their development activities.
Not more than 50 percent of the 1994 awards may be to previous grantees in the program; the remaining awards will be made
to organizations selected from among new applicants. Applications will be selected for funding on the basis of evaluation
criteria that reflect the program purposes and priorities and are contained in this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objectives of the Neighborhood Development Program are: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_To help neighborhood development organizations increase their capacities to carry out larger or more complex activities,
in cooperation with private and public institutions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To assist neighborhood development organizations to achieve long-term financial support for their activities.
The activities must benefit low- and moderate-income persons within the neighborhood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will make grants, in the form of matching funds, to eligible neighborhood development organizations.
Under section 123(e)(3), a grantee organization may receive no more than $75,000 in Federal matching funds in a single
program year. HUD reserves the right to make grants for less than the maximum amount. The amount of Federal matching
funds that an applicant receives during the program year will depend in part upon the amount of monetary contributions
raised in the preceding quarter of the program year from individuals, businesses, and nonprofit and other organizations
located within established neighborhood boundaries, and from neighborhood development funding organizations.
Contributions attributable to organizations or persons not residing in or conducting business within the grantee's
neighborhood, loans, in-kind services, contributions by owners of properties to be improved, fees for services,
public funds, and any in-lieu-of-cash contributions cannot be used to match Federal funds. These contributions
may, however, be used to carry out project activities. The neighborhood monetary contributions for matching purposes
must be raised within the one-year grant period. However, grant activities may be programmed over a one- to three-year
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Federal matching ratio will be established for each participating applicant in accordance with the statutory requirement
that the highest ratios be established for neighborhoods having the ``smallest number of households or greatest
degree of economic distress.'' Subject to the statutory maximum of $75,000, the Federal match for this program year
will range from one to six Federal dollars for each qualifying dollar raised by the grantee. Applications selected
to receive Federal funds will be rank-ordered and the matching ratios will be determined in accordance with these
two criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any application selected for the award of Federal funds that proposed a matching funds ratio in excess of the ratio
HUD determines for it will be offered an award of funds at the HUD determined ratio. However, any application selected
for award that proposed a match below the maximum ratio HUD determines for it will be funded at the level proposed by
the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal payments to participating neighborhood organizations will be made on a quarterly basis following receipt
of quarterly performance and financial reports. The maximum Federal payment to an applicant will be governed by the
amount of verified, qualifying monetary contributions received from local sources in the preceding quarter, multiplied
by the matching funds ratio established for the neighborhood.

D. Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications will be evaluated on the basis of the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) The extent of monetary contributions that the applicant proposes as a match to the Federal funds, supported by
reasonable evidence that private funding sources within the neighborhood have been realistically identified.
This requirement shall be waived, and an application may be awarded the full points available under this factor, if

E. Determination of Ratio for Federal Contribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related
problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before preparing an application, the applicant should carefully check the eligibility requirements described
in section I.C, Eligibility, of this NOFA. Applicants that are uncertain whether the city or urban county in which
they are located meets the current minimum standards of physical and economic distress (used in determining which
cities and urban counties were potentially eligible applicants under the Urban Development Action Grant Program)
are advised to consult the following two notices published by the Department in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: (1) ``Urban Development Action Grant: Revised Minimum Standards for Small Cities'' (52 FR 37876, October 9, 1987);
and (2) ``Urban Development Action Grant: Revised Minimum Standards for Large Cities and Urban Counties'' (52 FR
38174, October 14, 1987).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any applicant that needs additional help in determining its eligibility should contact the nearest Department of
Housing and Urban Development Field Office (Community Planning and Development Division). If assistance is needed,
the city or county community development office serving a neighborhood organization should be able to provide an
applicant with the HUD Field Office contact number. If unable to obtain a local contact, the HUD Headquarters contact
for this information is Mrs. Stella Hall, telephone number (202) 708&hyph;2186; or contact the TDD number: (202)
708&hyph;0564. (These are not toll-free numbers.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the submission deadline date, HUD will screen each application to determine whether it is complete. If an application
lacks certain technical items or contains a technical error, such as an incorrect signatory, HUD will notify the applicant
in writing that it has 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's written notification to cure the technical deficiency.
If the applicant fails to submit the missing material within the 14-day cure period, HUD will disqualify the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This 14-day cure period applies only to nonsubstantive deficiencies or errors. Deficiencies capable of cure will
involve only items not necessary for HUD to assess the merits of an application against the factors specified in this
NOFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to complying with relevant provisions of OMB Circulars A&hyph;110 and A&hyph;122, grantees will be required
to submit quarterly performance and financial reports. These reports should inform HUD of any changes that may affect
the outcome of the program, such as changes in any of the following: the governing board membership, staffing, working
relationships with local government and private organizations, fund raising activities, volunteer efforts, the
management plan, and the budget. The quarterly reports must also verify the amount of monetary contributions received
from within the neighborhood, as a basis for Federal disbursement of matching funds. Grantees must certify that none
of the monetary contributions originated through public funding sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees will be required also to submit a final report at the completion of the grant period. This final report must
describe fully the successes and failures associated with the project, including the reasons for the successes and
failures. It should also describe possible improvements in the methods used. The quarterly and final reports will

of the notice is to provide funding to improve neighborhood opportunities relating to employment, business, housing,
and the provision of essential services, all of which could benefit families significantly. However, because the
impact on families would be indirect and would be beneficial, no further review is considered necessary.

notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) was published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified
as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Area or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel
for the program to which the question pertains.

H. Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 has been implemented by 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department
in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of that part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD)
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.
