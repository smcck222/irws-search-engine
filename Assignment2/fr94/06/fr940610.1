Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1992 Congress passed, and the President signed, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776).
Title XXVIII of that Act amended in part the nuclear power plant licensing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act to authorize
explicitly the issuance of combined construction and operating licenses for nuclear power plants. The new legislation
largely codified the Commission's existing regulations in 10 CFR part 52 with respect to such combined licenses,
but also made several changes to the licensing process established under those regulations. On December 23, 1992,
the Commission issued a final rule amending part 52 in light of the new legislation (57 FR 60975). Finding prior public
comment on the part 52 amendments unnecessary because the changes were limited to incorporating the language of the
Energy Policy Act into the regulations, the Commission established a 60-day post-promulgation comment period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the Commission's
final rule. DC Circuit No. 93&hyph;1164. Recently, however, the NIRS voluntarily requested dismissal of its petition
for review (which the court granted) after obtaining the Commission's agreement, in the interest of judicial economy,
to provide the NIRS another opportunity for post-promulgation comment on the final rule's treatment of the so-called
``Sholly'' procedure applicable to combined licenses. The ``Sholly'' procedure, which the Commission made applicable
to combined licenses in the final rule in accordance with the Energy Policy Act (see 57 FR at 60976; 10 CFR 52.97(b)(2)(ii)),
allows the Commission to make an amendment to a combined license immediately effective (

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Directors (Board) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is proposing to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its regulation on assessments to provide for the quarterly collection of assessments by means of FDIC-originated
direct debits through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, based on invoices prepared by the FDIC using data
reported by insured institutions in their quarterly reports of condition. The FDIC believes that the proposed amendments
would result in a more efficient collection process, to the benefit of the deposit insurance funds and insured institutions,
and would reduce the regulatory burden on insured institutions. The Board is further proposing to amend the assessments
regulation to clarify the obligation of acquiring institutions to pay assessments on deposits assumed from institutions
terminating their insured status; to delete from the assessments regulation the existing references to experience
factors, which are not available for use after 1994; and to include such amendments to the FDIC's regulation on forms
as are necessitated by the proposed changes to the assessments regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Collection Improvement Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Existing Statutory and Regulatory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1817(c), requires that each insured depository
institution pay a semiannual assessment to the FDIC. Payment of the assessment is to be made in the manner and at the
time(s) prescribed by the Board. Each institution is to file a certified statement in such form and containing such
information as the FDIC requires. An officer of the institution must certify that the statement is true, correct,
and complete, and in accordance with the statute and related regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the FDIC's assessment regulations, which are based on a prior version of section 7 of the FDI Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the payment of assessments twice a year. The amount of the semiannual payment is computed by the institution.
The computation, and the resulting assessment amount, is shown on the certified statement filed by the institution,
which is accompanied by a check for the full amount of the assessment. The payment must be postmarked no later than January
31 for the first semiannual period of the year (January through June), and July 31 for the second semiannual period
(July through December). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose of the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC believes that the existing assessment collection process can be improved substantially by utilizing an
electronic payment process, to the benefit of insured depository institutions and the federal deposit insurance
funds. Because the existing process is paper-based, it is more time consuming and less efficient_both for insured
institutions and for the FDIC_than an improved collection process making fuller use of advanced payment technology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule introduces a more efficient collection process using the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.
Funds for assessment payments would be directly debited by the FDIC from accounts designated by insured depository
institutions for that purpose. This procedure would substantially improve the efficiency of the collection process,
in such ways as eliminating paperwork costs and allowing the FDIC to monitor assessment receipts electronically.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In connection with this improvement in the collection process, the FDIC believes that it is highly desirable to reduce
the regulatory burden imposed on insured depository institutions by shifting to the FDIC the responsibility of computing
each institution's assessment. To facilitate this process, the FDIC is also proposing a move to quarterly assessment
payments. The FDIC believes that this change would have other benefits as well, both for the FDIC and for insured institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A quarterly-payment schedule is a straightforward means of minimizing inefficiencies in the assessment collection
process that would not be addressed by other elements of the proposal. For example, it would simplify the assessment
computation by basing each quarterly installment on one quarterly report of condition rather than two. It would also
resolve a timing problem resulting from a statutory requirement. Under section 7(a) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(a),
the certified statements filed by each institution for a particular semiannual assessment period must be based on
the two reports of condition
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to be filed by the institution for the prior semiannual period. The report dates set pursuant to section 7(a) are March
31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The June 30 and December 31 report dates precede by only one day the beginning
of the semiannual assessment periods for which they provide the basis for assessment computation. As a result, the
report data needed by the institution for its assessment computation are not complete until the beginning of the semiannual
period, and are not required to be submitted by the institution until the end of the first month of the semiannual period.
If, as under the existing collection process, the payment due date falls early within the semiannual period, it is
necessary for each institution to compute its own assessment, since there is not sufficient time before the due date
for the FDIC to receive the relevant report data from the institution and to prepare and edit an assessment statement
based on the data. Under the existing collection process, any subsequent amendment of the reported data on which the
assessment is based can potentially_and often does_necessitate recalculation of the institution's assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For banks, the report of condition is called the Report of Income and Condition; for thrift institutions, the Thrift
Financial Report; and for insured branches of foreign banks, the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches
and Agencies of Foreign Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A possible solution to this timing problem would be to move the semiannual assessment due date to a later date during
the semiannual period, for example to the end of the first quarter of the period (that is, to March 31 and September 30).
This would be preferable to the existing system in that it would provide the additional time necessary for the FDIC
to receive the requisite data from insured institutions and to initiate a direct debit for the assessment amount due.
However, it would not permit other improvements that would result from the quarterly-collection proposal, such
as simplifying the assessment computation, reducing the data-refinement and billing-adjustment complications
associated with semiannual collection, and eliminating the risk of nonpayment for insurance coverage provided
for some portion of the assessment period in the case of an institution that fails prior to the payment due date. Thus,
the FDIC believes that the quarterly-collection proposal is preferable to delayed semiannual collection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the quarterly-collection proposal, institutions would be invoiced for an initial quarterly payment for the
first quarter of each semiannual assessment period (for example, the period beginning January 1) approximately
one month before the beginning of the period (in this example, on November 30), based on the report-of-condition data
for the first quarter of the preceding semiannual period (in this example, September 30). Although the due date for
this first quarterly payment (December 30) would fall approximately one month earlier than the due date for the semiannual
payment required under the existing regulations, the quarterly payment would be for only a portion (roughly one-half,
assuming minimal changes in the rate of deposit growth across quarters) of the full semiannual assessment amount.
The balance of the semiannual assessment_based on the report of condition for the last day of the second quarter of
the prior semiannual period (in the above example, December 31)_would be due approximately 3 months into the semiannual
period (March 30), about two months later than the existing single semiannual payment date (January 31). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on FDIC estimates, the proposed quarterly-payment plan should not result in a material financial loss either
to the FDIC or to insured depository institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is currently anticipated that, if adopted, the proposal would be implemented for the semiannual assessment period
beginning July 1, 1995.

1. Quarterly Invoices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the FDIC would provide to each insured depository institution a quarterly invoice based on the
quarterly report of condition most recently due from the institution. In addition, the invoice would reflect adjustments
from previous quarters, such as adjustments resulting from amendments to earlier reports of condition or from assessment
audits by the FDIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The invoices would be provided no later than 30 days before the due date of the quarterly assessment payment. As the
following table indicates, first-quarter invoices would be distributed by the preceding November 30 for the period
beginning January 1, and by the preceding May 30 for the period beginning July 1. The respective payment dates

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 for these invoices would be December 30 and June 30. Second-quarter invoices would be distributed by February 28 for
the then-current semiannual period, with a payment (debit) date of March 30, and by August 30 for the then-current
semiannual period, with a payment date of September 30.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would eliminate the existing process of averaging the two assessment bases derived from the two quarterly
reports of condition for the preceding semiannual period. Instead, as indicated above, each quarterly payment would
be based separately on the single most recent report of condition. For institutions whose deposits are increasing,
this change could result in slightly lower payments in earlier quarters and higher payments in later quarters, while
the converse would apply to an institution whose deposits are decreasing. On the whole, however, whether on an institution-by-institution
or industry-wide basis, elimination of averaging is expected to simplify the assessment process without having
a significant impact on the amount of assessments paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Assessment Computation Review Procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment-base data reflected on an institution's quarterly invoices would be copied from data reported by
the institution in its reports of condition. Given the source of the data and the mechanical nature of the assessment
computation, it is anticipated that there would be only limited occasion for institutions to disagree with the invoices.
However, a procedure for resolving any such disagreements is included in the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new procedure would apply only to disagreements expressly identified in &sect;327.3(h) of the proposed regulation,
such as where the institution believes the rate multiplier applied by the FDIC is inconsistent with the assessment
risk classification assigned to the institution for the semiannual period for which the payment is due. The new procedure
would not apply to disputes regarding the appropriateness of the assessment risk classification assigned to the
institution; such disputes would continue to be covered by the risk classification review procedure in the existing
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed new procedure, the period within which an institution could file a request for revision of an invoice
would generally terminate 60 days from the date of the invoice. However, where the revision would result from an institution-initiated
amendment to its report of condition, the filing deadline for the request for revision would be 60 days from the date
on which such amendment is filed. Such amendment of the report of condition would not automatically trigger an assessment
adjustment. Instead, institutions would need to utilize the new procedure to provide notice to the FDIC of the requested
revision resulting from the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Certified Statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, institutions would no longer be required to compute their assessments. However, pursuant
to section 7(c) of the FDI Act, each institution would still be required to file a semiannual certified statement.
For the proposed system, the FDIC would provide a certified statement form reflecting both first- and second-quarter
invoice data. The form would show a semiannual assessment amount based on the two quarterly reports of condition on
which, by statute, the certified statement is to be based. Each institution would be required to certify its agreement
with the assessment computation shown on the form as received from the FDIC or, alternatively, its agreement with
that computation as amended in a manner specified by the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with amendment of the assessments regulation, the certified-statement element of the proposal includes
incidental amendments to part 304 of the FDIC's regulations (``Forms, Instructions, and Reports'') (12 CFR part
304), for such purposes as revising the description of the certified statement forms in &sect;304.3.

4. Designated Deposit Account
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A necessary component of the proposed direct-debit payment system is the designation by each insured institution
of a deposit account to be debited by the FDIC. Under the proposal, each institution would be required to give timely
notice to the FDIC of the account designated by the institution for that purpose. In addition, each institution would
be required to take any action necessary to enable the FDIC to direct-debit assessment payments from the account,
and to ensure that the account has sufficient funds to cover the assessment amount on the FDIC invoice. Failure on the
part of the institution to take any such action or to provide sufficient funding in the designated account would be
deemed to constitute nonpayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Semiannual Notice of Assessment Risk Classification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the date of the notice of an institution's assessment risk classification currently described
in &sect;327.3(e) would be changed to coincide with the date of the first-quarterly invoice. The FDIC believes that
combining the notice and the invoice would result in operational efficiencies both for the FDIC and for insured depository
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment was requested by the FDIC on a similar operational change in connection with an assessment rulemaking proceeding
last year. The change on which comment was sought at that time was the consolidation of the assessment rate notice and
the certified statement form in a single mailing. A consolidated mailing was supported by each of the six comment letters
that addressed it. See 58 FR 34357, 34365 (June 25, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Payment of Interest on Overpayments and Underpayments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;327.7 of the existing assessments regulations, the FDIC pays interest to insured institutions for any
timely overpayments of assessments, from the time the assessment is due until the date a refund or credit is given for
the overpayment amount. Similarly, institutions are required to pay interest on underpayments from the assessment
due date to the date of payment of the shortfall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of inefficiencies inherent in the existing paper-based system, and in the semiannual collection procedure
that allows very little time for the refinement of report-of-condition data before it is used in assessment computations,
it typically takes in excess of three to five months from the assessment due date to identify, verify, and pay or collect
overpayment or underpayment amounts resulting from miscomputations or similar errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule contemplates a ``rolling'' correction process in which any necessary adjustments in the assessment
amount are made on a quarterly basis. Under this proposal, the FDIC would pay or collect interest on overpayments and
underpayments, respectively, on a full-quarter basis. Interest would be due for the period beginning the day after
the payment date on which the institution overpaid or underpaid and ending on the payment date for the quarterly invoice
reflecting the corresponding adjustment. Thus, even if an underpayment were identified early in the quarter, the
FDIC would not collect the balance due until the next quarterly assessment payment date, and would impose interest
for the entire quarter. The converse would apply to overpayments; that is, the amount of the overpayment, together
with interest through the next assessment payment date, would be credited to the institution on the invoice for the
next quarterly payment after the overpayment is discovered.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC believes that this approach would not have a detrimental impact on insured institutions. Significantly,
approximately 75 percent of incorrect assessment payments result from errors made by institutions in filling out
their certified statement forms. Such errors would be virtually eliminated under the proposed procedure. Moreover,
it is anticipated that any remaining adjustments would be processed more quickly, and that institutions would actually
pay less interest from underpayment errors_and would receive credit for overpayments more quickly_than under the
existing arrangement.

7. Fail-Safe Payment Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the proposed payment procedure relies on computerized systems, it seems prudent to provide for a back-up
plan to be triggered in the event of a system failure or similar but less global circumstances. The fail-safe plan incorporated
into the proposed rule provides that any institution that does not receive its quarterly assessment invoice by the
beginning of the month in which payment is due is to promptly notify the FDIC. It is anticipated that, in most cases,
the FDIC would provide a duplicate invoice to the institution. However, in the event that could not be done, the institution
would, as a preliminary matter, make its quarterly payment in the amount shown on its assessment invoice for the preceding
quarter. Any necessary adjustments to that payment would be reflected on the next quarterly invoice.

II. Mergers Resulting in the Termination of Insured Status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Assessment Base Adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;327.6(a) sets forth the rules for computing institutions' assessment bases when one institution
(a seller) transfers its deposits to one or more other institutions (buyers), and then goes out of business. Transactions
of this kind (transfers) can take many forms: they include statutory mergers, consolidations, statutory assumptions,
and contractual arrangements in which buyers purchase assets and assume deposits from a seller. Proposed &sect;327.6(a)
would cover all such cases. But it would not cover cases where the seller continues to survive (such as cases in which
a seller only sells some but not all of its branches). Nor would it cover cases in which buyers assume deposits from the
receivership for a failed institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sometimes the buyers complete a transfer (or related series of transfers) in the first quarter of a semiannual period
(January through March, or July through September). In that case, the buyers assume all the seller's deposits before
the end of the quarter. The buyers report the transferred deposits in their first-quarter reports of condition. Under
the proposed rule, the second-quarter payments made by the buyers would be based (in part) on the transferred deposits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But many transfers take place in the second quarter of a semiannual period (April through June, or October through
December). A seller still has deposits at the end of the first quarter, and reports the deposits in its first-quarter
report of condition. Under the proposed quarterly-payment schedule described herein, an institution continuing
in business would make a second-quarter payment based on these deposits, and that payment would represent an installment
on the assessment for the upcoming semiannual period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, where a seller has gone out of business before the start of the upcoming semiannual period, there may be a risk
that neither the seller nor the buyers would pay any assessments on these deposits under the proposed quarterly-payment
plan. The buyers would not have included these deposits in their first-quarter reports of condition, and would not
have counted the deposits in their first-quarter assessment bases. The net effect could be that neither the seller
nor the buyers would compensate the FDIC for insuring these deposits.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;327.6(a) would clarify the assessment obligation for these transfers. Section 7 of the FDI Act says
the FDIC must base an institution's assessment on the probability that the appropriate deposit insurance fund will
incur a loss with respect to the institution. Section 7 further specifies that the FDIC must take into account the likely
amount of any such loss. 12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(1). Accordingly, proposed &sect;327.6(a) would call for the buyers_the
institutions that would present a continuing insurance risk to the FDIC for the deposits_to pay assessments that
reflect that risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;327.6(a) would achieve this goal by adjusting the buyers' assessment bases upward. The proposed
rule would call for each buyer's assessment base to be increased by that buyer's ``pro rata share'' of the seller's
first-quarter assessment base: that is, by the ratio of the deposits that the buyer assumes from the seller to the seller's
total quarter-end deposits. The proposed regulation would correspondingly reduce the seller's assessment base.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This latter provision may seem superfluous. In virtually all such cases the seller would cease to exist before the
end of the transfer period. Sometimes, however, a related series of transfers could extend beyond the end of a semiannual
period. In that case, the seller would still be in existence at the start of the following period. The seller would make
a second-quarter payment based on its first-quarter assessment base. Absent this latter provision, the FDIC would
in effect be assessing the same deposits twice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This formula is designed to be relatively simple, and to be satisfactory for most cases. A seller generally transfers
all its deposits at the same time, even when several buyers assume the deposits. In a few cases, a seller may transfer
its deposits to several buyers over an interval: but even then, the interval tends to be short, and the seller tends
to decline in size (if it changes in size at all). The formula would function properly under these conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But the formula would not, on its own, accommodate cases in which a seller's volume of deposits increases between the
end of the quarter and the date of the transfer. In that event, the buyers would assume more deposits than the seller
reported in its report of condition. The formula would cause the buyers' collective assessment bases to increase
by an amount greater than the seller's quarter-end assessment base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;327.6(a) addresses this difficulty by putting a cap on the aggregate amount by which the buyers' assessment
bases could be increased. The FDIC considers that it would be justified in collecting an aggregate assessment based
on the seller's quarter-end assessment base, because the seller itself would pay such an assessment if the seller
remained in existence. But, by the same token, the FDIC would not be justified in collecting an aggregate assessment
based on a higher amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nor would the formula, on its own, accommodate more elaborate deposit-transfer arrangements. For example, a buyer
may be acting merely as an intermediary, or a transfer may be only incidental to other mergers or deposit-assumptions.
In such cases, the formula might not accurately reflect the likely amount of the loss that the buyer_or the other institutions_ultimately
pose to their insurance funds in the upcoming period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC does not believe it is possible to foresee all the special situations that might arise in complex cases. Proposed
&sect;327.6(a) accordingly would give the FDIC a limited flexibility to adjust a buyer's or seller's assessment
base. The proposed rule would specify that the FDIC may use this authority only to bring an institution's assessment
base into line with the true magnitude of the likely amount of the loss that the institution poses for the upcoming quarter_that
is, with the institution's true deposit-base at the beginning of that quarter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It must be emphasized that proposed &sect;327.6(a) would only apply to institutions that participate directly in
a transfer (or related series of such transactions), or that participate in transactions directly related to such
a transaction (for example, an institution that assumes deposits from a buyer). Furthermore, the authority would
not mean that the FDIC could consider other risk factors_ones unrelated to the volume of deposits transferred_in
determining the likely amount of the loss.

base (deposits less deductions) is $90 million. On October 15, Institution A transfers all its deposits to Institution
B and goes out of business. Institution A has only $98 million in deposits at the time of the transfer. The FDIC will increase
Institution B's September 30 assessment base to reflect its

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of Institution A's assessment base. That is, Institution B's assessment base will be increased by $88 million,
determined as follows: $98 million deposits acquired divided by $100 million deposits reported by Institution A
on its September 30 report of condition multiplied by $90 million assessment base (98/100 &times; $90 million), or
$88 million. Institution B would receive credit for any assessment payments attributable to the transferred deposits
that have already been made by Institution A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institution B's payment represents the first installment for the January through June assessment period. The FDIC

it is appropriate to adjust Institution B's assessment base to reflect that risk.

shrinks in size from $67 million to $50 million, and on November 30 transfers all its remaining deposits to Institution

The supporting calculation shows: Institution B_$33 million in deposits acquired by Institution B divided by $100
million deposits reported by Institution A on the September report of condition multiplied by $90 million assessment
base of Institution A determined from the report of condition based on September 30 report of condition; Institution

The circumstances presented in Example 4 remain constant for this example, except that the deposits acquired by Institutions
B and C are $50 million and $60 million, respectively. In this situation, the total deposits transferred exceed the
deposits reported in Institution A's September 30 report of condition. In this case, each institution's pro rata
share will be determined by dividing the acquiring institution's acquired deposits by the total deposits transferred
in bulk from the disappearing institution in that quarter. Thus, the September 30 assessment base of Institution
B would be increased by $41 million ($50 million deposits acquired divided by $110 million total deposits transferred
by Institution A during that quarter multiplied by the $90 million of Institution A's assessment base) and Institution
C's September 30 assessment base will be increased by $49 million ($60 million deposits acquired divided by $110 million

impose the duty_of making the filing on behalf of the seller. The proposed rule would do away with final certified statements
in the case of transfers, on the ground that final certified statements would not be needed in the new assessment plan.
As a collateral but incidental matter, the proposed rule would formally eliminate Form 6420/11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, in order to determine the buyer's first-quarter assessment base for use in computing its
second-quarter assessment payment, the FDIC would need to know the amount of deposits that the buyer has assumed.
The FDIC does not believe, however, that it is necessary to set forth a formal reporting requirement in the proposed
regulation. The FDIC expects that the existing reports that buyers must make to their primary supervisors would serve
this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution's second-quarter payment would be due_in full, and computed with reference to the institution's
assessment base as determined pursuant to proposed &sect;327.6(a)(2)_on the regularly-scheduled payment date.
An institution that underpaid this assessment would have to pay interest on the shortfall at the rate prescribed by
proposed &sect;327.7 (``Payment of interest on assessment underpayments and overpayments''). Accordingly, a
buyer might well find it convenient to estimate the deposits it planned to assume, and to relay the estimate to the FDIC.
If the payment exceeded the amount properly due, the buyer would be entitled to an adjustment on its next payment for
the excess amount so paid (plus interest). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the FDIC were to receive the estimates early enough, it could use the information when preparing the invoice for
the buyer's second-quarter payment. If not, the FDIC could either send out a supplemental invoice as soon as practicable
reflecting the amendments to the buyer's assessment base, or could make an appropriate adjustment to the buyer's
next assessment payment.

III. Deletion of References to Experience Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC's assessments regulations currently permit the use of ``experience factors'' in the computation of an institution's
assessment base, for the purpose of quantifying unposted debits and credits. However, under the existing regulations,
the use of experience factors will no longer be permitted for assessments due after 1994. Accordingly, the FDIC proposes
to delete all references to experience factors from the regulations.

IV. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contains a revision to an existing collection of information. The revision has been submitted to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Comments regarding the accuracy of the burden estimate, and suggestions for reducing the burden, should be addressed
to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3064&hyph;0057), Washington, DC 20503, with
copies of such comments sent to Steven F. Hanft, Assistant Executive Secretary (Administration), Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, room F&hyph;400, 550 17th St., NW., Washington, DC 20429. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, each insured depository institution is required to compute its own semiannual assessment. Under the
proposed rule, assessments would be computed by the FDIC using information reported by the institution in its quarterly
reports of condition. The institution would be required to certify its agreement with the assessment computation
shown on the certified statement form as received from the FDIC or, alternatively, its agreement with that computation
as amended in a manner specified by the institution. It is expected that, prior to certification, an institution would
compare the information on the form with its own records_which it collects and maintains for purposes of filing its
reports of condition_and, if necessary, indicate any amendments. This process should constitute a substantially
smaller burden for the institution than preparing and reporting its own assessment computation. The requirements
concerning the certified statement are found in &sect;327.2 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated annual reporting burden for the collection of information requirement in this proposed rule is summarized
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board hereby certifies that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the FDIC would compute the assessment payments due from each depository institution, a task currently
required of the institution. Thus, the proposal would reduce an existing burden. Moreover, to the extent any burden
would remain, the FDIC believes that it would be proportionate to the size of the institution and, accordingly, that
the proposal would not have a disparate impact of the nature contemplated by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board hereby requests comment on all aspects of the proposed rule. The Board particularly invites comment on the
proposal to collect assessments by means of direct debits initiated by the FDIC and on the impact of the quarterly collection
of assessments on insured depository institutions. Interested persons are invited to submit written comment during
a 60-day comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are not requested in this proceeding as to what measure_whether total deposits or another measure_should
be used as a basis for determining an institution's assessment base. The Board expects to seek public comment on that
subject in the near future, in a separate proceeding.

 Any such request for revision must be submitted within 60 days of the date of the quarterly assessment invoice for which
revision is requested, except that requests for revision resulting from detection by the institution of an error
or omission for which the institution files an amendment to its quarterly report of condition must be submitted within
60 days of the filing date of the amendment to the quarterly report of condition. The request for revision shall be submitted
to the Chief of the Assessment Operations Section, and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the revision
sought by the institution. If additional information is requested by the Corporation, such information shall be
provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the Corporation's request for additional information. Any
institution submitting a timely request for revision will receive written notice from the Corporation regarding
the outcome of its request. Upon completion of a review, the Chief Financial Officer (or his or her designee) shall

Assessment risk classification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the purpose of determining the annual assessment rate for BIF members under &sect;327.9(a), and the annual assessment
rate for SAIF members under &sect;327.9(c), each insured depository institution will be assigned an ``assessment
risk classification''. Notice of the assessment risk classification applicable to a particular semiannual period
will be provided to the institution with the first-quarterly invoice provided pursuant to &sect;327.3(c)(2). Each
institution's assessment risk classification, which will be composed of a group and a subgroup assignment, will
be based on the following capital and supervisory factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Capital factors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions will be assigned to one of the following three capital groups on the basis of data reported in the institution's
Report of Income and Condition, Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, or
Thrift Financial Report containing the necessary capital data, for the report date that is closest to the last day
of the seventh month preceding the current semiannual period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Well capitalized.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For assessment risk classification purposes, the short-form designation for this group is ``1''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, this group consists of institutions satisfying
each of the following capital ratio standards: Total risk-based ratio, 10.0 percent or greater; Tier 1 risk-based
ratio, 6.0 percent or greater; and Tier 1 leverage ratio, 5.0 percent or greater. New insured depository institutions
coming into existence after the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be included in this
group for the first semiannual period for which they are required to pay assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For purposes of assessment risk classification, an insured branch of a foreign bank will be deemed to be ``well
capitalized'' if the insured branch maintains the pledge of assets required under 12 CFR 346.19, and maintains the
eligible assets prescribed under 12 CFR 346.20 at 108 percent or more of the average book value of the insured branch's
third-party liabilities for the quarter ending on the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adequately capitalized.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For assessment risk classification purposes, the short-form designation for this group is ``2''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Except as provided in (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, this group consists of institutions that do not satisfy the
standards of ``well capitalized'' under this paragraph but which satisfy each of the following capital ratio standards:
Total risk-based ratio, 8.0 percent or greater; Tier 1 risk-based ratio, 4.0 percent or greater; and Tier 1 leverage
ratio, 4.0 percent or greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For purposes of assessment risk classification, an insured branch of a foreign bank will be deemed to be ``adequately
capitalized'' if the insured branch: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Maintains the pledge of assets required under 12 CFR 346.19; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Maintains the eligible assets prescribed under 12 CFR 346.20 at 106 percent or more of the average book value of the
insured branch's third-party liabilities for the quarter ending on the report date specified in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Does not meet the definition of a well capitalized insured branch of a foreign bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Undercapitalized.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For assessment risk classification purposes, the short-form designation for this group is ``3''. This group consists
of institutions that do not qualify as either ``well capitalized'' or ``adequately capitalized'' under paragraphs
(a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Supervisory risk factors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Within its capital group, each institution will be assigned to one of three subgroups based on the Corporation's consideration
of supervisory evaluations provided by the institution's primary federal regulator. The supervisory evaluations
include the results of examination findings by the primary federal regulator, as well as other information the primary
federal regulator determines to be relevant. In addition, the Corporation will take into consideration such other
information (such as state examination findings, if appropriate) as it determines to be relevant to the institution's
financial condition and the risk posed to the BIF or SAIF. Authority to set dates applicable to the determination of
supervisory subgroup assignments is delegated to the Corporation's Director of the Division of Supervision (or
his or her designee). The three supervisory subgroups are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subgroup ``A''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subgroup consists of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subgroup ``B''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subgroup consists of institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which, if not corrected, could result in significant
deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the BIF or SAIF; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subgroup ``C''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subgroup consists of institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to the BIF or SAIF unless effective
corrective action is taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payment of assessment at rate assigned.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions shall make timely payment of assessments based on the assessment risk classification assigned in the
notice provided to the institution pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. Timely payment is required notwithstanding
any request for review filed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. An institution for which the assessment risk
classification cannot be determined prior to an invoice date specified in &sect;327.3 (c)(1) or (d)(1) shall preliminarily
pay on that invoice at the assessment rate applicable to the classification designated ``2A'' in the appropriate
rate schedule set forth in &sect;327.9. If such institution is subsequently assigned for that semiannual period
an assessment risk classification other than that designated as ``2A'', or if the classification assigned to an institution
in the notice is subsequently changed, any excess assessment paid by the institution will be credited by the Corporation,
with interest, and any additional assessment owed shall be paid by the institution, with interest, in the next quarterly
assessment payment after such subsequent assignment or change. Interest payable under this paragraph shall be determined
in accordance with &sect;327.7.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 327, the portion of an institution's assessment base that is attributable
to deposits in lifeline accounts pursuant to the Bank Enterprise Act, 12 U.S.C. 1834, will be assessed at such rate
as may be established by the Corporation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1834 and section 7(b)(2)(H) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)(H).

(ii) If the institution's records show the total actual amount of unposted credits but do not segregate the amount
as stated in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the institution must report the total actual amount of the unposted
credits for addition to time and savings deposits.

 In the case of a newly insured institution, the assessment base for the last date for which insured depository institutions
are required to file quarterly reports of condition within the semiannual period in which the newly insured institution
became an insured institution shall be deemed to be its assessment base for that semiannual period. If the institution
has not filed such a report by the due date for such reports from insured depository institutions, it shall promptly
provide to the Corporation such information as the Corporation may require to prepare the certified statement form

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22764), indicated that public comments were
to be submitted to the OTS no later than July 17, 1994. This date was not properly calculated by the Office of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requested closing date for comments was 45 days from date of publication, or June 17, 1994. A correction was published
on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29480). However, in order to afford the public adequate time to comment, the OTS has determined
that closing date in the original notice should be used. The OTS believes that there has been sufficient level of confusion
about the closing date to warrant reinstating the later date. Therefore, the comment period is hereby extended until
July 18, 1994, as July 17 is not a business day.

This notice announces a call for proposals that will define the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aircraft
Certification Service, Rotorcraft Directorate Research and Development (RE&amp;D) initiative for Fiscal Year
(FY) 1997 by defining and documenting specific, potential RE&amp;D program proposals. The call for proposals will
focus on Aircraft Certification RE&amp;D programs that support activity related to FAR Parts 27, 29, and associated
operations Parts. Other FAA requirements such as flight standards, air traffic, or airway facilities will not be
addressed. The FAA is soliciting the public sector to ensure that proposed Rotorcraft RE&amp;D requirements will
have relevant, practical applications and will be cost effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each FY the FAA prepares an RE&amp;D program plan that includes new (and amended) RE&amp;D proposals. The Aircraft
Certification Service's Rotorcraft Directorate is responsible for preparing its part of the overall FAA submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The philosophy of the RE&amp;D process is to create an atmosphere that will promote the identification of requirements
by any person or organization in the government or private sector. This makes the RE&amp;D process more responsive
to public sector needs. Within the Aircraft Certification Service, the RE&amp;D process places increased emphasis
on FAA Aircraft Certification Directorate and Division level participation in identifying new requirements and
in sponsoring and monitoring the resulting RE&amp;D projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as part of the overall FAA and Aircraft Certification initiative, the FAA's Rotorcraft Directorate is
undertaking a directly-related initiative specifically for the rotorcraft community. It has the same basic mission,
goals, and procedures as the agency-wide initiative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rotorcraft Directorate will implement its segment of the FY&hyph;97 submittal by identifying, describing,
evaluating, and cataloging potential RE&amp;D requirements (i.e., proposals) for potential sponsorship and incorporation
into the overall FAA FY&hyph;97 RE&amp;D submittal. This will result in a coordinated FY&hyph;97 rotorcraft requirements
package that will be assigned to the appropriate FAA RE&amp;D provider organizations when approved and when funds
are allocated by the budget process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be stressed that the proposals that are evaluated as a result of this notice, if accepted, will not be funded
until the overall FAA FY 97 RE&amp;D submittal is funded, (i.e., at least two (2) years after their original submittal
on 10/15/94) and that reprogramming of limited RE&amp;D resources before then is highly unlikely. Also, the accepted
proposals will have to compete for resources with other requirements identified for RE&amp;D by other FAA activities.
Nonetheless, the need clearly exists to identify Rotorcraft Certification RE&amp;D needs to compete for the agency's
RE&amp;D resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a matter of information, there are four primary FAA RE&amp;D supplier organizations: (1) The Technical Center
(ACD) in Atlantic City, New Jersey; (2) the Research and Development Service (ARD) in Washington, DC; (3) the Office
of Environment and Energy (AEE) in Washington, DC; and (4) the Office of Aviation Medicine's Civil Aeromedical Institute
(AAM/CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. These organizations perform the RE&amp;D on programs that are approved and
funded through the process.

Developments in the use of monoclonal antibodies in immunohistochemical devices which are used as an aid in the diagnosis
and management of a variety of diseases, including neoplasms, make it appropriate to reassess FDA's regulation of
these devices. Among the major topics scheduled for discussion are: (1) The role of immunohistochemical products
in cancer diagnosis; (2) problems associated with the use of monoclonal antibodies in immunohistochemical techniques;
(3) the role of training and proficiency; (4) proposed role of the Biological Stain Commission in technical certification
of immunohistochemical antibodies; (5) discussion on a proposal for the classification of immunohistochemical
antibodies as class II medical devices; and (6) draft points to consider and guidance for the regulation of immunohistochemical
antibodies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 13, 1992, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor &amp; Environmental Resources; Division of
Environmental Protection; Office of Air Quality (WVOAQ) submitted a request to EPA to redesignate the Parkersburg
moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment. On November 13, 1992, the WVOAQ also submitted
a maintenance plan for the Parkersburg area as a revision to the West Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP). On
February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1994 submittal. The EPA is proposing to redesignate
the Parkersburg ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and proposing to approve the maintenance
plan submitted by the WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because the relevant requirements set forth in the
Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, have been met. This proposal to approve the redesignation is contingent upon West
Virginia's submittal of a revision to its maintenance plan's provisions for implementation of contingency measures.These
actions are being taken in accordance with the Clean Air Act. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally
enforceable part of the SIP for the Parkersburg area.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure
to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures
to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. (1977 Act, sections 110(a)(1) and 172.) The Parkersburg, West
Virginia nonattainment area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the
ozone NAAQS on September 12, 1978. (40 CFR 81.347) In accordance with section 110 of the 1977 Act, West Virginia submitted
a part D ozone SIP on November 15, 1979 which EPA approved as meeting the requirements of section 110 and part D of the
1977 Act. In its SIP, the State of West Virginia projected that the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area
would attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. The area failed to attain the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (hereafter the Act) were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549,
104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The nonattainment designation of the Parkersburg, West Virginia
area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, furthermore, it was classified
by operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) of the Act. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991)
and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area more recently has attained the ozone NAAQS, based on air
quality data from 1989 through 1991. In an effort to comply with the Act and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS,
on November 13, 1992 the WVOAQ submitted an ozone maintenance plan for the Parkersburg West Virginia area as a revision
to the West Virginia SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia also requested that EPA redesignate the Parkersburg, West Virginia
area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. In addition, on February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update
to its November 13, 1992 submittal, collectively referred to hereafter as the ``State of West Virginia's redesignation
request.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act, five specific requirements must be met in order for EPA to redesignate
an area from nonattainment to attainment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 175A of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Review of West Virginia's Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of West Virginia's redesignation request for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area included information
and documentation sufficient for EPA to determine that the five requirements of section 107, noted above have been
met. Following is a brief description of how the each of these requirements has been fulfilled. Because the maintenance
plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under
its analysis of the redesignation request. A Technical Support Document (TSD) has also been prepared by EPA on these
rulemaking actions. That TSD is available for public inspection at the EPA Regional Office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The submittal contains an analysis of ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation
request. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1989 through 1991 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Parkersburg,
West Virginia area. See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H. The State of West Virginia's redesignation request included documentation
that the Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area has complete, quality-assured data showing attainment
of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period. Therefore, the Parkersburg, West Virginia
area has met the first statutory criterion for redesignation to attainment of the ozone NAAQS found at section 107(d)(3)(E)(i)
of the Act. It is important to note that EPA has also reviewed the ozone data monitored during the 1992 and 1993 ozone
seasons in the Parkersburg area and determined that no violations of the standard were monitored during those years.
Therefore, there have been no violations of the ozone standard monitored in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parkersburg area since the 1988 ozone season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously stated, EPA fully approved the State of West Virginia SIP for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area as
meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act. The amended Act, however, modified section
110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore,
for purposes of redesignation, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under
the Act as of November 13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia submitted its redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.A. Section 110 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 110 of the 1977 Act was amended in 1990, the Parkersburg, West Virginia SIP meets the requirements
of section 110(a)(2) of the amended Act. A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA
believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that were amended, See 57 FR 27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements
of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the Act.
It contains enforceable emission limitations, it requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality
data, it requires preconstruction review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones,
it provides for adequate funding, staff, and associated resources necessary to implement its requirements, and
requires stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting.

2.B. Part D Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have
fulfilled applicable requirements of part D due as of the date of the State's redesignation request. Under part D,
an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the
basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable.
Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section
181(a). The Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area was classified as moderate. (See 56 FR 56694, codified
at 40 CFR 81.347.) Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, West Virginia must meet the applicable requirements
of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176_as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of
part D_due as of the date of the State's November 13, 1992 request for redesignation. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v)
to mean that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject
area prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come
due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation
of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.B.1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable no later than 3 years after an area has been designated
as nonattainment under the Act. EPA has determined that these requirements were not applicable to ozone nonattainment
areas on or before November 13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia, submitted a complete redesignation request
and maintenance plan for Parkersburg. Therefore, the State of West Virginia is not required to meet these requirements
for purposes of redesignation. West Virginia has, however, completed and submitted a 1990 base year emissions inventory
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its ozone nonattainment areas (including the Parkersburg area) in accordance with EPA's guidance. It is also important
to note that upon redesignation to attainment, the preconstruction new source review requirements for prevention
of significant deterioration (PSD) would apply in the Parkersburg area. EPA approved West Virginia's PSD SIP program
on April 11, 1986 (51 FR 12517).

2.B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed
States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both
transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance
plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to &sect;51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and &sect;51.851
of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation
conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly,
West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent
with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not
yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval
of this redesignation request.

2.B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of
section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 13, 1992, the date West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request
for the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area, the Parkersburg, West Virginia area was required to meet
the provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements
in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections
as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A notice of final rulemaking approving these RACT corrections was published
on September 17, 1992 (57 FR 42895). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed
to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for its ozone
nonattainment areas. On January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that
West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% rate of progress plan SIP revision for its ozone nonattainment areas. Upon
the effective date of a final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request, these findings will be automatically
rescinded in the Parkersburg nonattainment area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has
a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as
discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met.

4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the 1977 Act, EPA approved the State of West Virginia SIP control strategy for the Parkersburg, West Virginia
nonattainment area. EPA determined that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules
were enforceable. Since enactment of the 1990 amendments, the State of West Virginia submitted corrections to its
RACT regulations as identified above. EPA finds that these additional measures contribute to the permanence and
enforceability of reductions in ambient ozone levels in the Parkersburg, West Virginia area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Between 1988 and 1990, because of permanent and enforceable state and federal provisions, emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) were reduced by 2.28 tons/day and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were reduced by 1.0
tons/day in Parkersburg. Most of the reductions came from mobile sources and gasoline marketing-related activities.
The Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), of gasoline marketed for use in the Parkersburg, West Virginia area decreased from
10.5 RVP to 9.5 RVP in 1990 and was reduced to 9.0 in 1992. In addition, due to automobile fleet turnover, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was an increase in the percent of automobile operated in the Parkersburg area meeting more stringent emission standards
as required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). It must be noted here that since 1992 the federal
RVP requirement of 9.0 has been the applicable standard in the Parkersburg, West Virginia area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia maintenance plan requires the continuation of the federal RVP program. These reductions
due to lower RVP and more stringent tailpipe standards resulting from the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program were
determined using the mobile emission inventory model MOBILE 5.0a and the relevant vehicle miles traveled data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permanent and enforceable decreases in VOCs at stationary sources contributed a small amount to the total VOC reduction
in the Parkersburg, West Virginia area. In association with its emission inventory, the State of West Virginia demonstrated
that point source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn during the period in which
the Parkersburg, West Virginia area's ambient air quality came into attainment. Reductions due to decreases in production
levels or from other unenforceable scenarios such as voluntary reductions were not included in the determination
of the emission reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that the combination of measures contained in the SIP and federal measures have resulted in permanent and
enforceable reductions in ozone precursors that have allowed the Parkersburg, West Virginia area to attain the NAAQS,
and therefore, that the redesignation criterion of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) has been met.

5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing approval of the State of West Virginia maintenance plan for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area because
EPA finds that West Virginia's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. If EPA determines after
notice and comment that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment
area will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the area is redesignated. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which
demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.

5.A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC and NOx emissions from
area, stationary, and mobile using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 VOC
inventory is considered most representative of attainment conditions because no violations occurred in 1990 and
it reflects the typical inventory for the three-year period demonstrating attainment of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia submittal contains detailed inventory data and summaries by source categories. The State
of West Virginia submittal also contains information related to how it comported with EPA's guidance, which model
and emission factors were used (note MOBILE 5.0a was used), how Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) data was generated,
what RVP was considered in the base year, and other technical information verifying the validity of the Parkersburg,
West Virginia emission inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by source category. This
inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year
inventories are shown in the following six tables. The TSD which has been prepared for this action contains more in-depth
details regarding the base year for the Parkersburg area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the continued use of lower RVP gasoline (7.8) and fleet turnover to automobiles meeting more stringent
emission standards, mobile source emission projections are dependent upon the implementation of the federal reformulated
gasoline program. Total VOC and NO

 emissions were projected from the 1990 base year to year 2005. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance
with EPA guidance. The projections demonstrate that the ozone standard will be maintained i.e., emissions are not
expected to exceed the level of the base year inventory during this time period. EPA believes that the emissions projections
demonstrate that the area will continue to maintain the ozone NAAQS because this area achieved attainment through
VOC controls and reductions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Parkersburg, West Virginia area depends, in part, on the State of West
Virginia effort toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State of
West Virginia will track the status and effectiveness of the maintenance plan by periodically updating the emissions
inventory every three years. The WVOAQ has committed to perform this tracking on an annual basis in order to enable
the State of West Virginia to implement the contingency measures of its maintenance plan as expeditiously as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia annual update will indicate new source growth, as indicated by annual emission statements.
The State of West Virginia will continue to monitor ambient ozone levels by operating its ambient ozone air quality

 emissions in the Parkersburg area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS in
the future. Despite the State of West Virginia's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS,
the Parkersburg area may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, West Virginia has provided contingency measures
with a schedule for implementation in the event of future ozone air quality problems. In the event that exceedances
of the ozone NAAQS are measured such that nonattainment is indicated in any of the areas or in the event that periodic
emission inventory updates or major permitting activity reveals that excessive or unanticipated growth in ozone
precursor emissions has occurred or will occur, West Virginia will accordingly select and adopt measures including
the following to assure continued attainment:

1. Extend the applicability of 45CSR21 (VOC/RACT rule) to include source categories previously exclude

6. Implementation of basic (or enhanced) programs for motor vehicle inspection and maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One or more of these regulatory revisions would be selected within three (3) months after verification of a monitored
ozone standard violation and a draft rule submitted to the WVOAQ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality assurance procedures must confirm the monitored violation within 45 days of occurrence. The WVOAQ will be
requested to adopt the control measure(s) as emergency rule(s) which will be implemented within six (6) months after
adoption. EPA's approval of West Virginia's redesignation request is contingent upon West Virginia promulgating
a revision to its contingency plan that includes a schedule for the mandatory implementation of the selected contingency
measures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 175A(b) of the Act, the State of West Virginia has agreed to submit a revised maintenance
SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an
additional ten years. EPA has determined that the maintenance plan adopted by the State of West Virginia and submitted
to EPA on November 13, 1992 meets the requirements of section 175A of the CAA. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve
the maintenance plan submittal. In addition, EPA has determined that upon final approval of the maintenance plan
the provisions of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) for redesignation will have been met.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to approve the ozone maintenance plan for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area submitted by the State
of West Virginia on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because it meets the requirements of section
175A. In addition, EPA is proposing to redesignate the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area to attainment,
subject to final approval of the maintenance plan, because the Agency has determined that the provisions of section
107(d)(3)(E) of the Act for redesignation of nonattainment areas to attainment have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will be
considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the person and address listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 section at the beginning of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Ozone State
Implementation Plans (SIPs) are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act and to provide for
attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Today's proposed redesignation action should not be interpreted
as authorizing the State of West Virginia to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC emission limitations and restrictions
contained in the currently approved ozone SIP. Changes to the ozone SIP's regulations rendering them less stringent
than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan for attainment and maintenance is
submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and changes could result in both a finding
of nonimplementation under section 173(b) of the Act and in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant to section 110(k)(5).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter
I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have any economic impact
on any small entities. Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act does not impose
any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area
and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. Accordingly, I certify that EPA's approval of West Virginia's
request to redesignate the Parkersburg ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the associated maintenance plan
will not have an impact on any small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed amendments to the income, estate, and gift tax regulations under the Internal Revenue
Code relating to exceptions to the use of standard valuation tables for valuing annuities, interests for life or a
term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests. These amendments are necessary in order to provide guidance
consistent with court decisions that call for deviation from the use of standard valuation tables in valuing those
interests. The proposed regulations would apply in valuing all interests that would, but for the exceptions, be valued
under section 7520 of the Code.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains proposed regulations (26 CFR 1.7520&hyph;3(b), 20.7520&hyph;3(b), and 25.7520&hyph;3(b))
for the valuation of certain partial interests in property under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code),
as added by section 5031 of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, when the use of standard actuarial
tables would produce unreasonable results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations are proposed to be effective for valuation dates occurring after the date the regulations are published
as final regulations in the

Explanation of Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7520(a), which is effective after April 30, 1989, provides that the value of annuities, interests for life
or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests is to be determined under tables published by the IRS based
on an interest rate equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate (rounded to the nearest two-tenths
of one percent) in effect under section 1274(d)(1) for the month in which the valuation date falls. Section 7520(b)
provides that section 7520 shall not apply for purposes of any provision specified in regulations. The Conference
Report to the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1104, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 113 (1988),
1988&hyph;3 C.B. 603, explains that section 7520 does not apply to ``situations specified in Treasury regulations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS has never attempted to include in the regulations all of the different actuarial factors that could apply to
the many different kinds of vested and contingent annuity, income, and remainder interests that can arise in tax administration.
The actuarial tables that have been set forth in the regulations from time to time have listed only those factors that
are most frequently needed by taxpayers. Generally, these actuarial tables have included the one-life annuity,
income, and remainder factors for ages 0 through 109 and the term-certain annuity, income, and remainder factors
for periods of 1 through 60 years. These one-life and term-certain factors are often referred to in this notice of proposed
rulemaking as ``standard actuarial factors'' or ``standard section 7520 actuarial factors.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other standard actuarial factors that are less frequently needed by taxpayers are included in tables that have been
separately published by the IRS from time to time and that may be purchased from the Government Printing Office. The
tables in these books include two-life actuarial factors, as well as many one-life factors and term-certain factors
not found in the regulations tables. These publications also include a number of examples that illustrate how to compute
special section 7520 actuarial factors such as the annuity, income, or remainder factor for a period limited to the
lesser of a term certain or a lifetime. Special actuarial factors have for many years been referred to as such in the
regulations. See, for example, &sect;20.2055&hyph;2(f)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other special section 7520 actuarial factors that may apply to more unusual situations may be computed by the taxpayer
or, upon request, by the Internal Revenue Service for the taxpayer, by using actuarial methods consistent with those
used to compute the standard section 7520 actuarial factors that appear in the tables in the regulations and in the
Service's publications. Examples of these more unusual situations include an annuity payable for more than two lives,
a right to income for a term certain or until the prior death of the first to die of two individuals, and the right to receive
a remainder after a term certain if an individual survives the term.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating a standard section 7520 actuarial factor, certain assumptions are made. For all standard section
7520 actuarial factors in the single-life and term-certain tables in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d), the interest rate
for enjoyment or the postponement of enjoyment is the applicable section 7520 rate. In the case of a life annuity, income,
or remainder factor, the basis for mortality rates for measuring lives is the data in Table 80 CNSMT. However, in unusual
situations, where special section 7520 actuarial factors must be computed, one or more alternative assumptions
may be appropriate. For example, if the actual income is known to be below applicable standards, the section 7520 interest
rate may not be used to project the trust income yield. Similarly, if a measuring life is classified as terminally ill,
the standard mortality data from Table 80 CNSMT may not be used as the mortality basis. But, even though one or both of
these exceptions is applicable in a case, the section 7520 interest rate will ordinarily be used to discount the value
of the right to any postponed enjoyment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases requiring the valuation of ordinary annuities, income interests, and remainder and reversionary interests,
the courts have consistently recognized the need to use the standard actuarial factors prescribed by the regulations.

Commissioner,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 T.C. Memo 1993&hyph;483 (1993), the Tax Court allowed the taxpayer to improperly value an annuity with a standard
one-life annuity actuarial factor from Table A in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(f) in a situation in which the annuity could
have exhausted the fund from which the annuity was to be paid before the death of the annuitant. The Internal Revenue
Service believes that the annuity factor that should have been used in this case is a special annuity factor for the
right to receive annual payments for 4 years or until the prior death of the annuitant. See Rev. Rul. 77&hyph;454, 1977&hyph;2
C.B. 351. See also

Sections 1.7520&hyph;3(a), 20.7520&hyph;3(a), and 25.7520&hyph;3(a) set forth specific Code sections that are
exempt from the valuation rules of section 7520. The proposed regulations contained in this notice describe other
areas in which the valuation methodology applicable to standard and special section 7520 actuarial factors is not
to be used. Generally, if the interest in property that is to be valued is not an ordinary annuity, income interest,
or remainder interest, the standard annuity, income, and remainder factors in the tables of factors set forth in the
regulations and IRS publications cannot be used. In some cases in which the standard factors from the regulations
and publications tables cannot be used, a special factor may be computed by the taxpayer or by the Service upon the request
of the taxpayer. In other cases where standard or special factors may not be used, the property interest may be valued
using other valuation techniques. Depending upon the facts and circumstances, a property interest that cannot be
valued using the standard or special section 7520 factors may have no ascertainable value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations establish two primary tests to determine whether the fair market value of the interest is
computed by use of the standard section 7520 actuarial factors found in the regulations and IRS publications. The
first test is whether the instrument of transfer provides the beneficiary with the degree of beneficial enjoyment
that is consistent with the type of property interest that the standard valuation tables are designed to measure.
In this regard, the rights of an annuity beneficiary must be adequately defined and, if the annuity is payable from
a group of assets, the value of the assets must be sufficient to support all of the annuity payments. Similarly, the
rights of an income beneficiary must be consistent with the rights of an outright owner of the property interest for
the same period of time, and the rights of a remainder or reversionary beneficiary must be protected against invasion
or erosion of the corpus.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second test in the proposed regulations addresses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortality component of the transferred interest. The Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Service previously addressed this issue in Rev. Rul. 66&hyph;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
307, 1966&hyph;2 C.B. 429, and Rev. Rul 80&hyph;80. Rev. Rul. 66&hyph;307 set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the rule that the value of a life or remainder interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be determined by taking into account the health of the life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tenant if it was known on the valuation date that the life tenant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was afflicted with a fatal and incurable disease in its advanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stages and that the life tenant could not survive for more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brief period of time. Rev. Rul. 80&hyph;80 clarified the ``brief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period'' test in Rev. Rul. 66&hyph;307, and stated that the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life actuarial factors are to be applied to value the interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless death is clearly imminent. In the view of the Service, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the test for determining whether death is imminent set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in Rev. Rul. 66&hyph;307 and Rev. Rul. 80&hyph;80 does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactorily quantify the probability of death occurring within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 year from the valuation date, this test may permit the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard actuarial factors in inappropriate situations. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations propose to explicitly quantify the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for purposes of applying this test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, if an individual who is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring life of the interest being transferred is known to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminally ill, the mortality test of the proposed regulations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not satisfied and a special section 7502 actuarial factor, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a standard actuarial factor must be used in valuing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest. Terminal illness is defined in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as an incurable illness or other deteriorating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical condition that would substantially reduce a person's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life expectancy to the extent that there is at least a 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability that the individual will not survive for more than 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year from the valuation date. Exceptions are made in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for special situations under sections 2013, 2037, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2042. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the simultaneous death of the transferor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual who is the measuring life of a property interest, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations specifically preclude use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard factors in the tables to value that interest. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent in determining the previously taxed property credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 2013 and reaffirms the position of the Fifth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circuit in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are submitted timely (preferably a signed original and eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. In particular, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service invites comments on whether the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal illness adequately deals with certain illnesses that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to cause death in a short period of time but are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnosed more than 1 year before death. All comments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ordinary beneficial interests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary annuity interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the right to receive a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring lives or for some other defined period. A standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 7520 annuity factor for an ordinary annuity interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the present worth of the right to receive $1.00 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 7520 for the appropriate month. If an annuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of each period, a special adjustment must be made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary income interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the right to receive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income from, or the use of, property during one or more measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lives or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income factor for an ordinary income interest represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present worth of the right to receive the income from $1.00 for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7520 for the appropriate month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary remainder or reversionary interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to receive an interest in property at the end of one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more measuring lives or for some other defined period. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard section 7520 remainder factor for an ordinary remainder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reversionary interest represents the present worth of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to receive $1.00 at the end of a defined period, using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certain restricted beneficial interests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
restricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is an annuity, income, remainder, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reversionary interest that is subject to a contingency, power, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other restriction, whether the restriction is provided for by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of the trust, will, or other governing instrument or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by other circumstances. In general, a standard section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may not be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value a restricted beneficial interest. However, a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value a restricted beneficial interest under some circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 in &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b)(4), which illustrates a situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where a special section 7520 actuarial factor is needed to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account the shorter life expectancy of the terminally ill

Annuities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A standard section 7520 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annuity factor is not to be used to determine the present value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an annuity for a specified term of years or the life of one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more individuals unless the effect of the trust, will, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing instrument is to ensure that the annuity will be paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the entire defined period. In the case of an annuity payable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a trust or other limited fund, the annuity is not considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable for the entire defined period if, considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable section 7520 interest rate, the annuity is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust the fund before the last possible annuity payment is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in full. For this purpose, it must be assumed that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible for each measuring life to survive until age 110, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because every standard section 7520 life annuity factor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated on the basis of that assumption. If it is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the trust or other fund from which an annuity is to be paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may exhaust before the end of the defined period of the annuity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will be necessary to calculate a special section 7520 annuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor that takes into account the facts and circumstances that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may exhaust the trust or fund.

A standard section 7520 remainder interest factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary interest is not to be

consistent with the preservation and protection that the law of trusts would provide for a person who is unqualifiedly
designated as the remainder beneficiary of a trust for a similar duration, the effect of the administrative and dispositive
provisions for the interest or interests that precede the remainder or reversionary interest is to assure that the
property will be adequately preserved and protected from erosion, invasion, depletion, or damage until the remainder
or reversionary interest takes effect in possession and enjoyment. This degree of preservation and protection is
provided only if it was the transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions of the arrangement and the surrounding
circumstances, that the entire disposition provide the remainder or reversionary beneficiary with an undiminished
interest in the property transferred.

In general, pooled income funds are created and administered to achieve a special rate of return. A beneficial interest
in a pooled income fund is not ordinarily valued using a standard section 7520 income or remainder interest factor.
The present value of a beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is determined according to rules and special remainder

The mortality component prescribed under section 7520 is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity,
income interest, remainder interest, or reversionary interest if an individual who is a measuring life for the interest
dies or is terminally ill at the time of the transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), an individual who is
known to have an incurable illness or other deteriorating physical condition is considered terminally ill if there
is at least a 50 percent probability that the individual will die within 1 year.

Example 1._Annuity funded with unproductive property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The taxpayer transfers corporation stock worth $1,000,000 to a trust. The trust provides for a 6 percent ($60,000
per year) annuity in cash or other property to be paid to a charitable organization for 25 years and for the remainder
to be distributed to the donor's child. The trust specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to retain
the shares of stock. The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the transfer is 8.2 percent. The corporation has
paid no dividends on this stock during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this policy will change in the
near future. Under applicable state law, the corporation is considered to be a sound investment for a trust with diversified
investments because the corporation's practice of retaining its earnings has caused the value of the corporation
stock to grow commensurately each year. Considering the 6 percent annuity payout rate and the 8.2 percent section
7520 interest rate, the trust corpus is considered sufficient to pay this annuity for the entire 25-year term of the
trust, or even indefinitely. Thus, though the trust assets not likely to earn dividend income during the term of the
trust, the assets would be assumed to appreciate at the rate of 8.2 percent per year if there were no income. Therefore,
the trust's sole investment in this corporation is not expected to adversely affect the interest of either the annuitant
or the remainder beneficiary. Although it appears that neither beneficiary would be able to compel the trustee to
make the trust corpus produce investment income, the annuity interest in this case is considered to be an ordinary
annuity interest, and the standard section 7520 annuity factor may be used to determine the present value of the annuity.
In this case, the section 7520 annuity factor would represent the right to receive $1.00 per year for a term of 25 years.

Example 2._Terminal illness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The taxpayer transfers property worth $1,000,000, to a charitable remainder unitrust described in section 664(d)(2)
and &sect;1.664&hyph;3. The trust provides for a fixed-percentage 7 percent unitrust benefit (each annual payment
is equal to 7 percent of the trust assets as valued at the beginning of each year) to be paid quarterly to an individual
beneficiary for life and for the remainder to be distributed to a charitable organization. At the time the trust is
created, the individual beneficiary is age 60 and has been diagnosed with an incurable illness and there is at least
a 50 percent probability of the individual dying within 1 year. Because there is at least a 50 percent probability that
this beneficiary will die within 1 year, the standard section 7520 unitrust remainder factor for a person age 60 from
the valuation tables may not be used to determine the present value of the charitable remainder interest. Instead,
a special unitrust remainder factor must be computed that is based on the section 7520 interest rate and that takes
into account the projection of the individual beneficiary's actual life expectancy.

(A) An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary annuity interest 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is the right to receive a fixed dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives or for some other
defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth
of the right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for
the appropriate month. If an annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at the beginning of
each period, a special adjustment must be made in any computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary income interest 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is the right to receive the income from or the use of property during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined
period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the
right to receive the income from $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520
for the appropriate month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) An 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary remainder or reversionary interest 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is the right to receive an interest in property at the end of one or more measuring lives or for some other defined period.
A standard section 7520 remainder factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary interest represents the present

A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
restricted beneficial interest 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is an annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest that is subject to any contingency, power, or other restriction,
whether the restriction is provided for by the terms of the trust, will, or other governing instrument or is caused
by other circumstances. In general, a standard section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may not be used to
value a restricted beneficial interest. However, a special section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may
be used to value a restricted beneficial interest under some circumstances. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If, under the provisions of &sect;20.7520&hyph;3(b), the interest rate and mortality components prescribed under
section 7520 are not applicable in determining the value of any annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest,
the actual fair market value of the interest (determined without regard to section 7520) is based on all of the facts
and circumstances if and to the extent permitted by the Code provision applicable to the property interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annuities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A standard section 7520 annuity factor is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity for a specified
term of years or the life of one or more individuals unless the effect of the trust, will, or other governing instrument
is to ensure that the annuity will be paid for the entire defined period. In the case of an annuity payable from a trust
or other limited fund, the annuity is not considered payable for the entire defined period if, considering the applicable
section 7520 interest rate, the annuity is expected to exhaust the fund before the last possible annuity payment is
made in full. For this purpose, it must be assumed that it is possible for each measuring life to survive until age 110,
because every standard section 7520 annuity factor is calculated on the basis of that assumption. If it is determined
that the trust or other fund from which an annuity is to be paid may exhaust before the end of the defined period of the
annuity, it will be necessary to calculate a special section 7520 annuity factor that takes into account the facts
and circumstances that may exhaust the trust or fund.

A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest is not to be used to determine the present value
of an income or similar interest in trust for a term of years, or for the life of one or more individuals, unless the effect
of the trust, will, or other governing instrument is to provide the income beneficiary with that degree of beneficial
enjoyment of the property during the term of the income interest that the principles of the law of trusts accord to a
person who is unqualifiedly designated as the income beneficiary of a trust for a similar period of time. This degree
of beneficial enjoyment is provided only if it was the transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions of the
governing instrument and the surrounding circumstances, that the trust provide an income interest for the income
beneficiary during the specified period of time that is consistent with the value of the trust corpus and with its preservation.
In determining whether a trust arrangement evidences that intention, the treatment required or permitted with respect
to individual items must be considered in relation to the entire system provided for in the administration of the subject
trust. Similarly, in determining the present value of the right to use tangible property (whether or not in trust)
for one or more measuring lives or other specified period of time, the interest rate component prescribed under section
7520 and &sect;20.7520&hyph;1 is not to be used unless, during the specified period, the beneficiary is entitled

Example 1._Unproductive property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The decedent's will provides for a bequest of corporation stock to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income
is payable to the decedent's child for life. After the death of the life income beneficiary, the trust is to terminate
and the trust property is to be distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The trust specifically authorizes, but
does not require, the trustee to retain the shares of stock. The corporation has paid no dividends on this stock during
the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state
law, the corporation is considered to be an adequately sound growth investment for a trust with diversified investments
because the corporation's practice of retaining its earnings has caused the value of the corporation stock to increase
commensurately each year. The facts and circumstances, including applicable state law, indicate that the life income
beneficiary would not be able to compel the trustee to make the trust corpus productive in conformity with the requirements
for a lifetime trust income interest under applicable local law. Therefore, the life income interest in this case
is considered nonproductive. Consequently, the income interest may not be valued actuarially under this section.

 The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except that the trustee is not specifically authorized to retain the shares of stock. Further, the terms of the trust
specifically provide that the life income beneficiary may require the trustee to make the trust corpus productive
consistent with income yield standards for trusts under applicable state law. Under that law, the minimum rate of
income that a productive trust may produce is substantially below the section 7520 interest rate for the month of the
decedent's death. In this case, because the income beneficiary has the right to compel the trustee to make the trust
productive for purposes of applicable local law during the beneficiary's lifetime, the income interest is considered
an ordinary income interest for purposes of this paragraph, and the standard section 7520 life income interest factor
may be used to determine the present value of the income interest.

Example 3._Discretionary invasion of corpus.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The decedent transfers property to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income is to be paid to the decedent's
child for life and the remainder of the trust is to be distributed to a grandchild. The trust authorizes the trustee
without restriction to distribute corpus to the decedent's surviving spouse for the spouse's comfort and happiness.
In this case, because the trustee's power to invade trust corpus is unrestricted, the exercise of the power could result
in the termination of the income interest at any time. Consequently, the income interest is not considered an ordinary
income interest for purposes of this paragraph, and may not be valued actuarially under this section.

Example 4._Limited invasion of corpus.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The decedent bequeaths property to a trust under the terms of which all of the trust income is to be paid to the decedent's
child for life and the remainder is to be distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The trust authorizes the child
to withdraw up to $5,000 per year from the trust corpus. In this case, the child's power to invade trust corpus is limited
to an ascertainable amount each year. Annual invasions of any amount would be expected to progressively diminish
the property from which the child's income is paid. Consequently, the income interest is not considered an ordinary
income interest for purposes of this paragraph, and the standard section 7520 income interest factor may not be used
to determine the present value of the income interest. Nevertheless, the present value of the child's income interest
is ascertainable by making a special actuarial calculation that would take into account not only the initial value
of the trust corpus, the section 7520 interest rate for the month of the transfer, and the mortality component for the
child's age, but also the assumption that the trust corpus will decline at the rate of $5,000 each year during the child's
lifetime. The child's right to receive an amount not in excess of $5,000 per year may be separately valued in this instance
and, assuming the trust corpus would not exhaust before the child would attain age 110, would be considered an ordinary
annuity interest.

Example 5._Power to consume.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The decedent devises a life estate in 3 parcels of real estate to the surviving spouse with the remainder to a child.
The decedent also confers upon the spouse an unrestricted power to consume the property, which includes the right
to sell part or all of the property and to use the proceeds for the spouse's support, comfort, happiness, and other purposes.
Any portion of the property or its sale proceeds remaining at the death of the surviving spouse is to vest by operation
of law in the child at that time. In this case, the surviving spouse's power to consume the corpus is unrestricted, and
the exercise of the power could entirely exhaust the remainder interest during the life of the spouse. Consequently,
the remainder interest is not considered an ordinary remainder interest for purposes of this paragraph and may not
be valued actuarially under this section.

 Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the mortality component prescribed under section 7520
is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity, income interest, remainder interest, or reversionary
interest if an individual who is a measuring life dies or is terminally ill at the time of the decedent's death. For purposes
of this paragraph (b)(3), an individual who is known to have an incurable illness or other deteriorating physical
condition is considered terminally ill if there is at least a 50 percent probability that the individual will die within
1 year.

If, in the case of the allowance of the credit for tax on a prior transfer under section 2013, the tax in the transferor's

time of the transferor's death, the value of any transferred interest dependent on any of those lives shall be determined
for purposes of section 2013 without regard to the fact that those measuring lives were terminally ill. In addition,
the value of a decedent's reversionary interest under section 2037(b) or 2042(2) shall be determined without regard
to the physical condition of the decedent immediately before death.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1._Simultaneous deaths. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The decedent's will establishes a trust to pay income to the decedent's surviving spouse for life. The will provides
that, upon the spouse's death, or if the spouse fails to survive the decedent, the trust property is to pass to the decedent's
children. The decedent and the decedent's spouse die simultaneously in an accident under circumstances in which
it was impossible to determine who survived the other. Applicable state law presumes that the decedent died first
with the result that the property interest is considered to have passed in trust for the benefit of the spouse for life,
after which the remainder is to be distributed to the decedent's children. Therefore, the spouse's life income interest
may not be valued under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2._Terminal illness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The decedent bequeaths $1,000,000 to a trust under the terms of which the trustee is to pay $103,000 per year to a charitable
organization during the life of the decedent's child. Upon the death of the child, the remainder in the trust is to be
distributed to the decedent's grandchild. The child, who is age 60, has been diagnosed with an incurable illness,
and there is at least a 50 percent probability of the child dying within 1 year. The section 7520 interest rate for the
month of the decedent's death is 10.6 percent. The standard life annuity factor for a person age 60 (7.4230) may not
be used to determine the present value of the charitable organization's annuity interest because there is at least
a 50 percent probability that the measuring life will die within 1 year. Instead, a special section 7520 annuity factor
must be computed that takes into account the projection of the child's actual life expectancy.

 For purposes of this section:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary annuity interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the right to receive a fixed dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives or for some other
defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth
of the right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for
the appropriate month. If an annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at the beginning of
each period, a special adjustment must be made in any computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinary income interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the right to receive the income from or the use of property during one or more measuring lives or for some other defined
period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the
right to receive the income from $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520
for the appropriate month. However, in the case of certain gifts made after October 8, 1990, if the donor does not retain
a qualified annuity, unitrust, or reversionary interest, the value of any interest retained by the donor is considered
to be zero if the remainder beneficiary is a member of the donor's family. See &sect;25.2702&hyph;2.

 is an annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest that is subject to any contingency, power, or other restriction,
whether the restriction is provided for by the terms of the trust, will, or other governing instrument or is caused
by other circumstances. In general, a standard section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may not be used to
value a restricted beneficial interest. However, a special section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may
be used to value a restricted beneficial interest under some circumstances. See

 If, under the provisions of &sect;25.7520&hyph;3(b), the interest rate and mortality components prescribed under
section 7520 are not applicable in determining the value of any annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest,
the actual fair market value of the interest (determined without regard to section 7520) is based on all of the facts

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annuities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A standard section 7520 annuity factor is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity for a specified
term of years or the life of one or more individuals unless the effect of the trust, will, or other governing instrument
is to ensure that the annuity will be paid for the entire defined period. In the case of an annuity payable from a trust
or other limited fund, the annuity is not considered payable for the entire defined period if, considering the applicable
section 7520 interest rate, the annuity is expected to exhaust the fund before the last possible annuity payment is
made in full. For this purpose, it must be assumed that it is possible for each measuring life to survive until age 110,
because every standard section 7520 annuity factor is calculated on the basis of that assumption. If it is determined
that the trust or other fund from which an annuity is to be paid may exhaust before the end of the defined period of the
annuity, it will be necessary to calculate a special section 7520 annuity factor that takes into account the facts
and circumstances that may exhaust the trust or fund.

Beneficial enjoyment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest is not to be used to determine the present value
of an income or similar interest in trust for a term of years, or for the life of one or more individuals, unless the effect
of the trust, will, or other governing instrument is to provide the income beneficiary with that degree of beneficial
enjoyment of the property during the term of the income interest that the principles of the law of trusts accord to a
person who is unqualifiedly designated as the income beneficiary of a trust for a similar period of time. This degree
of beneficial enjoyment is provided only if it was the transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions of the
governing instrument and the surrounding circumstances, that the trust provide an income interest for the income
beneficiary during the specified period of time that is consistent with the value of the trust corpus and with its preservation.
In determining whether a trust arrangement evidences that intention, the treatment required or permitted with respect
to individual items must be considered in relation to the entire system provided for in the administration of the subject
trust. Similarly, in determining the present value of the right to use tangible property (whether or not in trust)
for one or more measuring lives or other specified period of time, the interest rate component prescribed under section
7520 and &sect;25.7520&hyph;1 is not to be used unless, during the specified period, the beneficiary is entitled
to that degree of use, possession, and enjoyment of the property that an outright owner would be entitled to exercise
during a similar period of time.

A standard

The donor transfers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation stock to a trust under the terms of which all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trust income is payable to a child for life. After the death of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the life income beneficiary, the trust is to terminate and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trust property is to be distributed to a grandchild. The trust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain the shares of stock. The corporation has paid no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dividends on this stock during the past 5 years, and there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication that this policy will change in the near future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under applicable state law, the corporation is considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequately sound growth investment for a trust with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversified investments because the corporation's practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining its earnings has caused the value of the corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock to increase commensurately each year. The facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, including applicable state law, indicate that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income beneficiary would not have the legal right to compel the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trustee to make the trust corpus productive in conformity with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements for a lifetime trust income interest under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local law. Therefore, the life income interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this case is considered nonproductive. Consequently, the income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest may not be valued actuarially under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Beneficiary's right to make trust productive.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, except that the trustee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not specifically authorized to retain the shares of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation stock. Further, the terms of the trust specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that the life income beneficiary may require the trustee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make the trust corpus productive consistent with income yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for trusts under applicable state law. Under that law, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum rate of income that a productive trust may produce is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially below the section 7520 interest rate on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuation date. In this case, because the income beneficiary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to compel the trustee to make the trust productive for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of applicable local law during the beneficiary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lifetime, the income interest is considered an ordinary income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest for purposes of this paragraph, and the standard section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7520 life income factor may be used to determine the value of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income interest. However, in the case of gifts made after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 8, 1990, if the donor was the life income beneficiary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of the income interest would be considered to be zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this situation. See &sect;25.2702&hyph;2.

Annuity trust funded with unproductive property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The donor, who is age 60, transfers corporation stock worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1,000,000 to a trust. The trust will pay a 6 percent ($60,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year) annuity in cash or other property to the donor for 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years or until the donor's prior death. Upon the termination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the trust, the trust property is to be distributed to the donor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child. The section 7520 rate for the month of the transfer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.2 percent. The corporation has paid no dividends on the stock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law, the corporation is considered to be a sound investment for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trust with diversified investments because the corporation's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of retaining its earnings has caused the value of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation stock to grow commensurately each year. Considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 6 percent annuity payout rate and the 8.2 percent section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7520 interest rate, the trust corpus is considered sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay this annuity for the entire 10-year term of the trust, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even indefinitely. Thus, though the trust assets not likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earn dividend income during the term of the trust, the assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be assumed to appreciate at the rate of 8.2 percent per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year if there were no income. Therefore, the trust's sole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment in this corporation is not expected to adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the interest of either the annuity beneficiary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remainder beneficiary. The trust specifically authorizes, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not require, the trustee to retain the shares of stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it appears that neither beneficiary would be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compel the trustee to make the trust corpus produce investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income, the annuity interest in this case is considered to be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordinary annuity interest, and a section 7520 annuity factor may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to determine the present value of the annuity. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, the section 7520 annuity factor would represent the right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive $1.00 per year for a term of 10 years or the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death of a person age 60.

retained a unitrust interest equal to 7 percent of the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the trust property, valued as of the beginning of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the trust corpus is nonincome producing, the present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the donor's retained unitrust interest may be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by using the section 7520 unitrust factor for a term of years or

a prior death.

Eroding corpus in an annuity trust. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The donor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who is age 60 and in normal health, transfers property worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1,000,000 to a trust. The trust will pay a 10 percent ($100,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year) annuity to a charitable organization for the life of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the donor, and the remainder is to be distributed to the donor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child. The section 7520 rate for the month of the transfer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.8 percent. Because the 10 percent annuity payout rate exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 6.8 percent income and growth rate that the trust is expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to experience each year, the annuity payout must be assumed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progressively erode the corpus. Using an interest rate of 6.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, an annuity payout of $100,000 per year will exhaust a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1,000,000 trust corpus in 18 years. The final payment at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the 18th year will consist of a partial payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$32,712. Under section 7520, the standard life annuity factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are based on the assumption that any person may survive until age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110. This means that the standard life annuity factor for age 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9.8585) takes into account the separate probabilities that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person age 60 may survive to receive each of 50 different annuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. However, in the present case, because of the eroding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corpus, the person age 60 can be assumed to receive no more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17 $100,000 annuity payments, regardless of how long that person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might survive. Therefore, the standard life annuity factor for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person age 60 (9.8585) is not applicable in this case, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special section 7520 annuity factors that take into account the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18-year limitation on the annuity payout must be used. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special annuity factor for the present value of the right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive $1.00 per year for 17 years or until the prior death of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person age 60 is $8.6121, and the special factor for the present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the right to receive $1.00 in 18 years if a person age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 survives is $.1836. The present value of the charitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annuity interest is $867,269 ($100,000 X 8.6121 plus $32,712 X 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
.1836).

The mortality component prescribed

value of an annuity, income interest, remainder interest, or

reversionary interest if an individual who is a measuring life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dies or is terminally ill at the time the gift is completed. For

purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), an individual who is known to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an incurable illness or other deteriorating physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition is considered terminally ill if there is at least a 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Terminal illness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The donor transfers property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth $1,000,000 to a child in exchange for the child's promise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pay the donor $103,000 per year for the donor's life. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donor is age 60 but has been diagnosed with an incurable illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has at least a 50 percent probability of dying within 1 year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the transfer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10.6 percent, and the standard annuity factor at that interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for a person age 60 in normal health is 7.4230. Thus, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the donor were not terminally ill, the present value of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annuity would be $764,569 ($103,000 X 7.4230). Because there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least a 50 percent probability that the donor will not survive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1 more year, the standard section 7520 annuity factor may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to determine the present value of the donor's annuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest. Instead, a special section 7520 annuity factor must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computed that takes into account the projection of the donor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual life expectancy.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule proposes to amend the regulations outlining the nutrition standards for the National School Lunch and School
Breakfast Programs. It is part of an integrated, comprehensive plan for promoting the health of children. Specifically,
this proposal would update the current nutrition standards to incorporate the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
which reflect medical and scientific consensus on proper nutrition as a vital element in disease prevention and long-term
health promotion. This proposal would also adopt meal planning based on analysis of key nutrients (Nutrient Standard
Menu Planning) in lieu of the current meal pattern. These changes would be implemented no later than July 1, 1998. The
Department will be providing State agencies and school food authorities with technical assistance to enable them

In developing this proposed rule, the Department is responding to an array of medical and scientific evidence linking
improper diet with increased incidence of heart disease, strokes and certain cancers. These proposals acknowledge
the positive role school programs must play in establishing childhood eating patterns that influence lifelong habits.
The Department also considered extensive oral testimony presented at four public hearings and meetings as well as
written comments submitted in response to a notice published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of the importance of reinventing and streamlining government programs, this proposal would also
remove various paperwork burdens associated with the school meal programs and would modify the review requirements
for the National School Lunch Program to ensure adequate oversight of the proposed updated nutrition standards.
The overriding purpose behind this proposed rule is to serve more nutritious and healthful meals to school children
while maintaining access to the meal programs for needy children, and to enhance the flexibility of local schools
to administer the programs.

This proposed rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601
through 612). The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has certified that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In the interest of furthering efforts to
reinvent government, this rule proposes a substantial reduction in current State agency administrative burdens
and a technical adjustment in the recordkeeping burdens. Moreover, the Department of Agriculture (the Department
or USDA) does not anticipate any adverse fiscal impact on local schools. A recent analysis by FNS and the Department's
Economic Research Service found that the menu planning aspects of this proposal can be met at the current cost of food
in the National School Lunch Program. Therefore, food costs should not be a barrier to implementation of this regulation.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is intended
to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its
provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to
the provisions of this proposed rule or the application of the provisions, all applicable administrative procedures
must be exhausted. In the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, the administrative procedures
are set forth under the following regulations: (1) School food authority appeals of State agency findings as a result
of an administrative review must follow State agency hearing procedures as established pursuant to 7 CFR 210.18(q);
(2) School food authority appeals of FNS findings as a result of an administrative review must follow FNS hearing procedures
as established pursuant to 7 CFR 210.30(d)(3); and (3) State agency appeals of State Administrative Expense fund
sanctions (7 CFR 235.11(b)) must follow the FNS Administrative Review Process as established pursuant to 7 CFR 235.11(f).

Nutrition Standards in the School Meal Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The primary purpose of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), as originally stated by Congress in 1946 in section
2 of the National School Lunch Act (NSLA), 42 U.S.C. 1751, is ``to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's
children&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' At that time, nutritional concerns in the United States centered on nutrient
deficiencies and issues of underconsumption. Over time, meal requirements for the NSLP, 7 CFR 210.10, were designed
to provide foods sufficient to approximate one-third of the National Academy of Sciences' Recommended Dietary Allowances
(RDA). Participating schools were required to offer meals that complied with general patterns established by the
Department. These patterns were developed to provide a balanced meal by focusing on minimum amounts of specific components
(meat/meat alternate, bread/bread alternate, vegetables, fruits and dairy products) rather than on the nutrient
content of the entire meal. Over the years, virtually no substantive changes have been made to these patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An array of scientific data now augments our knowledge by documenting that excesses in consumption are a major concern
because of their relationship to the incidence of chronic disease. The typical diet in the United States is high in
fat, saturated fat and sodium and low in complex carbohydrates and fiber. The meal requirements for the NSLP have not
kept pace with the growing consensus of the need to modify eating habits. Given the importance of school meals to the
nation's children, especially needy children, the Department is committed to meeting its health responsibilities
by updating the nutrition standards for school meals to ensure that children have access to a healthful diet as well
as an adequate one. To accomplish this task, the Department is proposing to have school meals conform to the 1990 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (hereinafter referred to as the Dietary Guidelines) as well as provide proper levels of
nutrients and calories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposal would expressly incorporate the 1990 Dietary Guidelines into the school meals programs'
nutrition requirements, the Department will consider incorporating into the regulations any updates of the Dietary
Guidelines or other scientific recommendations. Specific use of the 1990 Dietary Guidelines will allow the Department
to review any revisions of the Dietary Guidelines to determine their applicability to school programs, and will avoid
any undue burden on State agencies and school food authorities to make the changes without the direction of implementing
regulations.

Scientific Studies Leading to Development of the Dietary Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Over the past thirty years a large body of evidence based on epidemiological, clinical and laboratory investigation
has established that dietary patterns in the United States are associated with an increased risk of chronic disease
including coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer (Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition
and Health, 1988; National Academy of Sciences, Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk,
1989). Research summarized in the Surgeon General's Report indicates that five of the ten leading causes of death
in the United States are associated with diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this accumulating body of scientific research establishing diet/disease links, dietary recommendations
for the United States population were developed in the late 1970's. The first of these developed in 1977 by the Senate
Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, established Dietary Goals for the United States. This was followed
closely by The Surgeon General's Report: Healthy People (1979). USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) released the first Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Dietary Guidelines were subsequently updated in 1985 and again in 1990. Also in 1990, Title III of the National
Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990 (NNMRRA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;445), 7 U.S.C. 5301, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was enacted. Section 301 of the NNMRRA, 7 U.S.C. 5341(a), requires that the Dietary Guidelines be reviewed at least
every five years by a panel of experts in the various fields that contribute to nutrition guidance. The task of the panel
is to decide whether there is sufficient evidence for altering the existing Dietary Guidelines and, if so, to recommend
specific changes. The Secretaries of the DHHS and USDA then make the final decision on whether or not to incorporate
the recommended changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process was first established when the Senate Appropriations Committee, in November, 1980, stipulated that
a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee be established to review the first edition of the Dietary Guidelines and
to make any recommendations deemed appropriate. The committee consisted of nine members (three from USDA, three
from DHHS and three selected from a list of nominees recommended by the National Academy of Sciences). In 1988, a second
committee comprised of nine prominent experts in nutrition and health was appointed by the Secretaries of USDA and
DHHS. Pursuant to Section 301(a) of the NNMRRA, a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee will be empaneled in 1995
to determine whether the 1990 Guidelines should be modified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result, the Dietary Guidelines are based on the best available scientific and medical knowledge. Consequently,
the Department is proposing to use the Dietary Guidelines as the basis for the nutrition standards for school meals.
This established procedure enables medical and scientific experts to continually review and recommend updating
of the Dietary Guidelines in light of the most current and highly-regarded data in this area. Moreover, the private
sector and general public have widely endorsed and relied upon the Dietary Guidelines in nutrition education programs,
activities and marketing. Because of the widespread acceptance of the recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines,
the Department believes that the transition to using these recommendations as the cornerstone for the school meal
programs will be readily accepted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1988 Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health and a 1989 National Academy of Science Report: Diet and Health:
Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk reinforce the Dietary Guidelines. One common theme runs throughout
each of the publications, that is, an improved diet can have positive health consequences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent Diet and Health report issued by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences (1989)
provides a very thorough review of the scientific evidence linking diet to disease and gives quantifiable goals for
some of the Dietary Guidelines. The report recommends that Americans reduce fat intake to 30% or less of calories,
reduce saturated fat intake to less than 10% of calories and reduce the intake of cholesterol to less than 300 mg per
day. The report also recommends that sodium intake be limited to 2400 milligrams or less per day.

School Meals' Lack of Compliance With Current Dietary Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Dietary Guidelines recommend that people eat a variety of foods; maintain a healthy weight; choose a diet
with plenty of vegetables, fruits, and grain products; and use sugar and sodium in moderation. The Dietary Guidelines
also recommend diets low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol so that over time, fat comprises 30 per cent or less
of caloric intake, and saturated fat less than 10 per cent of total calories, for persons two years of age and older.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, information available to the Department consistently shows that children's diets, including meals served
in schools, do not conform to the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines. For example, according to data from the
1989 and 1990 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals conducted by USDA, fat composed, on average, 35 per
cent of calories for the diets of children ages six to nineteen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equally significant were the findings of a nationally representative USDA study entitled the School Nutrition Dietary
Assessment (SNDA) Study. Released in October, 1993, the SNDA Study presented findings on the nutrients and foods
provided in school meals and described the dietary intakes of students on a typical school day. A total of 545 schools
were surveyed, and approximately 3,350 students in grades one through twelve (with assistance from parents for children
grades one and two) provided detailed information about foods and beverages consumed in a day that included school
attendance. The study compared nutrients provided in school meals with the Dietary Guidelines' recommendations
on fat and saturated fat, the National Research Council's (NRC) Diet and Health Recommendations on sodium, cholesterol
and carbohydrate intake, and the current objective that the nutrients provided in the NSLP meet one-third of the RDA
and that the School Breakfast Program (SBP) meet one-fourth of the RDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNDA findings showed that, while school lunches meet or exceed one-third of the RDA for key nutrients and food energy,
they do not meet the recommended levels of fat and saturated fat established by the Dietary Guidelines. In fact, the
report showed that school lunches exceeded the Dietary Guidelines' recommendations for fat and saturated fat. Specifically,
the average percentage of calories from total fat was 38 per cent compared with the recommended goal of 30 per cent or
less; and the percentage from saturated fat was 15 per cent, compared with the recommended goal of less than 10 per cent.
The report also found that children who ate the school lunch consumed a significantly higher amount of calories from
fat than children who brought their lunch from home or obtained a lunch from vending machines or elsewhere at school.
Further, the report showed that virtually no schools were in compliance with the Dietary Guidelines. In over 40 percent
of schools, students could select a meal that met the Dietary Guidelines, but few did so. The SNDA study also showed
that while school meals met the NRC recommendation on cholesterol, the meals did not meet the NRC recommendations
on sodium and carbohydrate levels. In fact, the level for sodium, at 1,479 milligrams, was nearly two times the lunch
target of 800 milligrams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the SBP did meet most of the recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines, the majority of school meals do
not conform to current scientific knowledge of what constitutes a healthful diet. The SNDA findings underscore that
the program has not adapted or changed school meal patterns over the years to incorporate scientific knowledge about
diet. This situation is cause for concern because it demonstrates the need for significant improvement if the programs
are to play their appropriate role in promoting long-term health through proper nutrition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the first step toward achieving meaningful improvement in children's diets and, thus, their health and future
well being, the Department considers it necessary to update the regulations which establish the specific nutrition
criteria for reimbursable school meals to incorporate the RDA for key nutrients, energy allowances for calories,
and the most current nutritional standards as outlined in the Dietary Guidelines. In this way, the school meal programs
can provide an example of nutritional achievement as well as ensuring that children are served healthful meals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before proceeding with a rulemaking, however, the Department recognized the importance of public input. The following
is a description of the Department's procedure for obtaining input and a discussion of significant issues raised
by commenters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To obtain input from the public prior to drafting proposed regulations, the Department solicited comments on nutrition
objectives for school meals through public hearings and written comments. In a Notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 47853, September 13, 1993), the Department announced a series of four public hearings. Any person who was interested
could register to speak at any of the hearings. Persons unable to testify in person were invited to submit written comments.
The Notice identified the following four questions as the focus areas for comments and suggestions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. What are the health consequences of children's current dietary patterns?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. How can the Dietary Guidelines for Americans be used to bring about measurable nutritional improvements in school
meals and in children's diets?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. What are the opportunities and obstacles in meeting current nutrition recommendations in school meal programs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV. What actions can the USDA, parents, school food service, food industry and other public and private organizations
take to encourage the implementation of current nutrition recommendations in local schools?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four hearings were held in Atlanta, Georgia on October 13, 1993; in Los Angeles, California on October 27, 1993;
in Flint, Michigan on November 12, 1993; and in Washington, DC on December 7, 1993. Each hearing was presided over jointly
by officials from USDA and officials from USDA's Federal partners in this effort_the Department of Education (DOEd)
and DHHS. The inclusion of representatives from DOEd and DHHS is an important asset in modifying the school meal programs
both because of their expertise and their missions. The school meal programs must be considered in the context of the
educational framework, as overseen by DOEd, and the national policies regarding health care and disease prevention
under the aegis of DHHS. Therefore, USDA is very pleased that a partnership is being forged among all Federal agencies
responsible for assisting the nation's schoolchildren. USDA is also pleased to be working with DOEd and DHHS to further
their policy initiatives_Goals 2000: Educate America Act (DOEd) and Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion
and Disease Prevention Objectives (DHHS). Of particular concern are solutions to issues such as increasing public
awareness of the links between diet and health, familiarizing the public with the need to establish good eating habits
in children that will be carried on through their lifetimes and finding innovative ways to incorporate the school
meal as a learning experience into daily school curriculums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variety of witnesses from the fields of medicine, nutrition and education, food service, production and processors
and other food industry representatives, as well as parents, students and other consumers and the general public,
testified at each of the hearings. Witnesses were asked to focus their remarks on one of the four questions stated above.
A transcript of each hearing was prepared, and witnesses could, if they wished, also submit written testimony and
copies of any materials used to prepare their remarks. As noted above, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice also solicited written comments from anyone who could not attend one of the hearings. To be assured of consideration,
comments had to be submitted on or before December 15, 1993. The written testimony and all comment letters were reviewed
and analyzed by the Department prior to preparation of this proposed regulation. This portion of the preamble provides
a summary of the comments.

Summary of Comments Received
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overwhelming majority of commenters, representing a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, called for
improvements to school meals. Comments from the public, students, and parents, while expressing serious concerns
and supporting change, were general in nature and provided few specific details. However, commenters from the medical,
nutrition, and food advocacy communities, State and local food service professionals, and food industry representatives
provided detailed information and frequently recommended specific actions.

Commenter Categories
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 363 witnesses testified at the hearings, and an additional 2,013 written comments were received by the Department.
Of the 2,376 commenters: 21% were medical professionals, nutritionists or dietitians, representatives of public
health, nutrition, or food organizations; 21% were from the general public; 21% were parents and students; 16% were
school food service personnel, representatives of school food service organizations or representatives from State
education/child nutrition agencies; 11% were teachers, school officials or representatives from school associations;
7% were food industry representatives; and 3% were representatives of other State or Federal agencies or members
of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is very pleased that so many persons took the time to testify or to submit written comments and would
like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation for their comments and suggestions. The commenters represented
an extensive cross-section of perspectives and provided a great variety of opinions and recommendations. Especially
gratifying were the number of students and parents who commented. These groups are, after all, the constituency that
the Department considers program ``customers,'' and it is these groups the Department is seeking to serve better.

Comment Breakdown
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following number of commenters addressed some aspect of the four basic questions: I. 796; II. 703; III. 752; IV.
1,464. Though comments varied greatly in content, the following significant themes emerged: (1) The need to improve
school meals in order to improve the health of children; (2) the need for school meals to reflect current nutrition
recommendations, specifically reductions in fat and saturated fat as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines; (3)
the importance of an integrated nutrition education program that involves students, parents, teachers, and school
food service personnel; (4) the need to revise current commodity programs to provide schools with more nutritious
foods; and (5) the need to incorporate nutritional improvements while at the same time improving the appeal of meals
offered to ensure that nutritious meals are consumed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also notes that many commenters raised distinct issues within the four stated questions. For example,
many commenters cited the need for vegetarian alternatives; others argued for inclusion of fast food companies in
the NSLP, and several specific commodity issues were raised. Therefore, the Department has included an analysis
of several of these issues in this preamble. Following are the more prevalent issues raised by the over 2,300 commenters
and the number of commenters who addressed them:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fat levels in school meals: 1,048;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The need for more fruits and vegetables: 829;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The importance of nutrition education: 794;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Concerns about milk and dairy products including the statutory requirement for whole milk and recommendations
for a beverage substitute: 687;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Department's Food Distribution Program and commodities: 493;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The costs and operational difficulties of implementing the Dietary Guidelines: 448;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The need for whole grains in school meals: 387;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Fast foods and fast food companies (both for and against availability in schools): 385;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Vegetarian alternatives for school meals: 263;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Sodium levels in school meals: 213;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The importance of breakfast: 200.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Readers should note that while all comments were taken into consideration, this preamble does not generally discuss
individual comments. The preamble does, however, address the common themes which emerged and responds to specific
individual comments when they raised significant issues.

Health Consequences Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Close to 800 commenters addressed some issue relevant to health consequences and diet. The majority of commenters
were from the public and the medical communities. Generally speaking, all of the commenters focused on the link between
diet and disease, specifically, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and cancer. The majority of these commenters
cited the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in the United States, both among children and adults, and the need
to improve the diets of young children in order to prevent the development of heart disease in adulthood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters wrote in support of the positions taken by a number of major medical associations. These commenters
focused on the importance of improving the diets of children, given the strong evidence that heart disease begins
early in life, and emphasized the need to provide foods rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates for the possible prevention
of some cancers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters addressed the potential link between diet and learning and behavioral difficulties. These
comments ranged from general observations regarding improper nutrition and lack of concentration, to specific
concerns addressing functional disabilities, behavioral disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive disabilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also pointed out that nutritional issues are especially vital for under-privileged and ethnic populations.
Specifically, commenters cited the poor nutritional intake among low income children and certain minority populations.
One commenter indicated that these populations, who are most at risk, do not appear to associate nutritional risk
factors with leading causes of death. Commenters also expressed concern over the high incidence of major diseases
among low-income, minority populations_specifically, the higher incidence of heart disease and hypertension
among African-Americans, obesity among Hispanics and Native Americans, and diabetes among Native Americans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a large number of commenters addressed the growing incidence of obesity among children, and the threat this
poses to future health. A number of commenters expressed concern over the lack of physical activity in schools as a
factor leading to the increase of obesity among school children. Several indicated the need to integrate exercise
with other components of good health including school meals. In addition, the unique needs of children with special
health problems, the need for proper diet in the prevention of osteoporosis, and the escalating cost of health care
and the role of diet as a preventative measure were identified as important concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Dietary Guidelines for Americans' Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 700 commenters, many from the public and from the school food service community, addressed the issue of school
meals meeting nutritional guidelines, the majority of which overwhelmingly agreed that meals should comply with
the Dietary Guidelines, especially the recommended limits on fat and saturated fat. Most commenters agreed with
the need for school meals to meet the Dietary Guidelines; however, several commenters indicated that compliance
with the Dietary Guidelines should be voluntary. With respect to the current meal patterns, many school food service
commenters indicated that they could not meet the Dietary Guidelines within the meal pattern requirements, and others
indicated that the current meal pattern requirements make it difficult to provide multi-cultural meals to children.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the implementation of Nutrient Standard Menu Planning (NSMP), a menu planning system
that is based on the analysis of nutrients. Commenters believed this system would provide increased flexibility
in meal planning as well as consistent analysis of nutrients. Commenters also suggested that this NSMP approach can
assist in providing more culturally diverse meals. It must be noted that some commenters expressed concern that some
smaller schools may not have or be able to afford the technical capability needed to conduct the analysis. Some commenters
also suggested that the Department or State agencies should develop menus that meet the Dietary Guidelines. These
menus can be used by smaller and school districts with fewer resources, which may initially have difficulty implementing
NSMP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Nutrition Education Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Close to 800 commenters pointed to the need for nutrition education for parents, teachers, children, food service
staff, and school administrators. Many commenters came from the nutrition and food service arenas as well as the general
public. Commenters supported the idea that nutrition education should be included in comprehensive health education
curriculums and should begin at an early age. Commenters also indicated the need for nutrition education to be reinforced
by healthful meals in the cafeteria. Commenters pointed to the need for a national nutrition media campaign. Many
school food service commenters expressed their desire for national minimum professional standards which food service
personnel would be expected to meet. In addition, a significant number of commenters urged health promotion as a component
of health care. Finally, many commenters supported the need for increased funding for the Department's Nutrition
Education and Training (NET) program, 7 CFR Part 227. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Taste and Plate Waste Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters from a wide range of commenter categories were quite critical of the current quality of school meals,
noting that lack of appeal leads to increased plate waste. Some cautioned, however, that drastic changes in the kinds
of food served may drive children away from school meals. These commenters generally supported the need to make meals
both appealing to children and nutritious. A number of commenters also cautioned that the increased amount of certain
foods that may be necessary to provide a nutritious diet may result in more plate waste if children do not find the meals
to be appetizing. Several commenters supported the need to involve culinary institutes and chefs in meal preparation
as a way to improve taste and presentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Fat in Meals Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nearly one out of two commenters discussed fat in school meals, with most of these commenters coming from the general
public and the medical community. The large majority of commenters who addressed the issue of fat content cited the
need to lower fat and saturated fat levels in school lunches. Some of the comments were general statements such as ``need
more low fat foods,'' while others made specific recommendations detailing the levels of fat and saturated fat that
school meals should meet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of medical, public health, and school food service related organizations addressed this issue, all of which
were in support of lowering the fat content of meals. A number of commenters recommended that the fat content of meals
be set at between 10 to 20 percent of total calories_lower than the current Dietary Guidelines recommendation of 30
percent of calories from fat.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of food service workers and directors cautioned that increasing portion sizes of certain foods and serving
more expensive fresh produce to meet a 30 percent limit on calories from fat may result in higher costs. Some commenters
also expressed concern that lowering fat may result in decreased calories critical for growing children. Several
commenters advised that low fat meals need to be appealing so children will consume them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several industry representatives indicated that industry is responsive to the need to lower fat and is already making
a number of changes to provide more low fat products. A number of commenters, including food service staff, parents
and members of the general public made specific recommendations on how to lower fat in school meals, such as trimming
or draining fat from meat, eliminating added fats from vegetables, and serving soups more often. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, many commenters, primarily students and the general public, suggested that the fat content in school meals
could be reduced by offering more vegetarian meals, eliminating the whole milk requirement, revising the commodity
system to encourage more purchases of low fat items such as fruits and vegetables, and reducing the amount of fast food
items and processed foods in school meals.

Meat and Meat Related Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received over 200 comments related to meat products, with most comments coming from students, parents
and the general public. Many commenters indicated that the current serving size for the meat/meat alternate component
is too large and recommended that schools cut down on the amount of meat served. Commenters also indicated that more
poultry and fish should be offered. Some commenters recommended that tofu and isolated soy proteins, as well as yogurt,
be added to the list of allowable meat alternatives. (The Department wishes to call attention to the fact that isolated
soy proteins are currently permitted with some limitations.) On the other hand, several industry representatives
cautioned against reducing the amount of meat too much due to its nutritional contributions, specifically, essential
amino acids, iron, zinc, and vitamin B6. They also observed that children are familiar with meat and will consume it
more readily than some alternative protein sources.

Menu Selection and Variety Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received over 250 comments in support of offering more vegetarian meals. Commenters supported the
low fat nature of vegetarian meals and their contribution to a healthful diet. Others addressed the need to expose
children to more vegetarian foods and foods from diverse cultures at an early age. Some commenters provided specific
examples of non-meat items, such as tofu and other plant-based sources, that could be used in school meals, while others
simply indicated a general need for more meat-free alternatives. Students as well as school food service personnel
indicated the need to offer vegetarian choices as students are requesting them more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received over 800 comments in support of the use of more fruits, vegetables, or grain products. Commenters
gave specific recommendations regarding preparation methods and serving ideas, including offering salad bars
more frequently, increasing the variety of fruits and vegetables, and serving more whole grain items. Others recommended
the use of more grain and bean products, citing their nutritional benefit as well as low cost. Many school food service
commenters expressed concern over serving more and a wider variety of fruits and vegetables as children may not be
familiar with them and, therefore, may not consume them.

Breakfast Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
About 200 commenters, primarily from the medical, school food service, and education communities, addressed breakfast
meal issues with a number of these commenters supporting the importance of breakfast to the health of children. A number
of food service personnel indicated their success with the SBP and desire to increase participation. Others, while
supporting the SBP, expressed concern with the nutritional quality of breakfasts currently offered.

Financial, Paperwork, and Other Operational Obstacles Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 250 commenters addressed financial and paperwork obstacles, with many of these comments coming from food service
(local and State) professionals, the general public, and the nutrition community. A number of commenters indicated
that the need to avoid operating at a deficit has prevented food service staff from providing more nutritious meals.
Commenters also complained that the amount of paperwork required to administer the feeding programs is excessive
and that the review system is cumbersome and inflexible. Specifically, commenters stressed the need to focus more
on nutrition and less on meal-by-meal accountability, income verification, and review requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed concern over the cost of producing meals under the current meal pattern system. Commenters
indicated that schools already find it difficult to provide meals within current resources and maintained that any
further nutritional requirements placed on schools would result in additional financial hardship. Commenters
specifically noted obstacles such as the increased cost of providing more foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables,
low fat and low sodium ingredients, and the increased portion sizes needed to meet the nutrition standards without
exceeding the 30% fat limitation. On the other hand, some parents and students indicated that they would be willing
to pay extra for more nutritious meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters indicated that the school meal periods are not adequate, thereby forcing students to throw
food away, consume it too quickly, or bring meals from home to prevent waiting in the lunch line. Others expressed concern
that more nutritious meals would require larger portions or extra food items that children may not be able to consume
during short lunch periods.

A number of commenters expressed the need for the Department to establish partnerships with other Federal agencies
such as DOEd, DHHS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as with industry representatives, State
agencies, school boards, nutrition professionals, extension programs, parents, teachers, and especially students.
Commenters also addressed the need for Federal efforts to support, not hamper, local efforts. Commenters indicated
that the Department should use its resources and purchasing power to promote change and improve meal quality.

The majority of these commenters were from the general public as well as the school food service and industry arenas.
Over 250 commenters indicated that a more healthful variety of USDA commodities should be made available to States.
The majority encouraged the Department to reduce the amount of fat, cholesterol, and/or sodium in the commodities.
These and a number of closely related comments are perhaps best characterized by the opinion of over 50 commenters
that the commodities provided to the NSLP should comply with the Dietary Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also notes that over 100 commenters addressed the Department's September 1993 announcement of the
Fresh Fruit and Vegetable initiative. Most of the comments were supportive of the initiative. Twenty-five commenters
stressed the need to use the funds available to schools for direct food purchases as effectively as possible.

Miscellaneous Comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters indicated the need to upgrade school kitchens to allow for the storage and preparation of more nutritious
meals. In line with this objective, some commenters urged reauthorization of Federal funding for food service equipment.
Commenters also pointed to the need for schools to disclose nutrition information so that students can make informed
choices and parents and the community would have a basis by which to assess progress. A number of commenters cautioned
against instituting changes too rapidly and encouraged the Department to take gradual steps. Others recommended
that the Department market successful programs to serve as models. Several commenters recommended that the Department
allow for a reimbursable snack to be served as a way to supply the extra foods that may be required to meet nutritional
standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department wishes to call attention to several issues raised by commenters that are not germane to this
proposal, either because of statutory constraints or because they address areas in which the Department believes
State agencies and school food authorities need flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Milk and Dairy Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received over 600 comments regarding milk and dairy products, with most comments coming from the general
public, parents and the school food service community. The majority of commenters recommended that schools not be
required to offer whole milk, with a large number of these comments coming from the food service community. Commenters'
reasons for eliminating the whole milk requirement included the high fat content, the perceived conflict with the
Dietary Guidelines and its higher cost. Many commenters also recommended that non-dairy alternatives be offered
in place of milk, as dairy products are high in fat, cholesterol, and protein; contain little iron and fiber; and, commenters
claimed, are not tolerated well by many children. Commenters also recommended that more skim, one percent, and two
percent milk be offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters supported maintaining the whole milk requirement, on the grounds that children may not consume low
fat alternatives and eliminating the requirement would be costly to the Federal dairy program. Others, while not
supporting the whole milk requirement, did caution against reducing or eliminating dairy products, as they provide
necessary calcium for growing children.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wishes to call attention to the fact that the requirements that fluid milk be available as a beverage
and that whole milk be available as an option for the NSLP, are required by section 9(a)(2) of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1758(a)(2).
Therefore, the Department cannot deviate from these provisions by regulatory action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Free Meals to All Children
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 140 commenters, primarily from the school food service community, advocated a program in which meals would be
served free of charge to all children, regardless of their families' economic status. Such a program would eliminate
the income eligibility requirements, and all children would receive meals free of charge, regardless of their family's
income. Many indicated that such a program would reduce paperwork, increase time for necessary nutrition-related
activities, and reduce the stigma associated with participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Again, however, such a revision would require specific statutory authority in light of the requirement of section
9(b)(1)(A) of the NSLA 42 U.S.C. 1758(b)(1)(A), that school meals be provided at no cost only to those children from
households with incomes of less than 130% of the Federal Income Poverty Guidelines. The Department also notes that
such a program, implemented fully in all schools, would increase the cost of NSLP by $7 billion if fully implemented
in School Year 1996. About one-half of this increase would be spent on higher reimbursement for meals currently reimbursed
at the fully paid and reduced price rates. In other words, about $3.5 billion of the additional funding would be spent
even before reaching any more children.

Fast Foods, Competitive Foods, Other Foods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters were concerned with the increase of fast food companies, fast food-like items and competitive
foods of low nutritional value that are sold in schools. Others felt that, since fast foods are popular, their use should
be increased. The Department is not proposing any specific provisions on fast foods or competitive foods at this time.
However, it should be noted that, under this proposal, meals claimed for reimbursement which include such foods will
be required to comply with established nutritional standards over one week. Further, school food authorities would
be required to continue to observe the restrictions currently in the regulations prohibiting the sale of foods of
minimal nutritional value in competition with the NSLP and SBP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that certain kinds of foods_principally milk, meat and processed foods_be eliminated
entirely from program meals. These recommendations were based on the assumption that some foods are good for people
and some are intrinsically bad. However, the Department does not share this view. The Department continues to believe
that it is important to obtain essential nutrients from a variety of foods. The Department also emphasizes that foods,
particularly those high in fat, must be eaten in moderation, but there are no plans to prohibit any foods from school
meals other than the foods of minimal nutritional value currently enumerated in appendix B of part 210 for the NSLP
and &sect;220.12 for the SBP.

Minimum Professional Standards

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that the Department establish minimum professional standards for local food service
workers. The Department is aware that efforts are being made to address this issue. For example, the American School
Food Service Association has developed a program to certify food service workers. However, given the wide range of
variances in needs and resources among the 20,000 school food authorities and 92,000 schools operating under the
NSLP, as well as varying State requirements, the Department does not believe it is feasible to propose uniform national
standards. Nevertheless, the Department does intend to continue to provide technical assistance and guidance to
both State agencies and local school food authorities on ways to improve food service operations.

Cash in Lieu of Commodities/Commodity Letter of Credit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 18(b) of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1769(b), Congress established the Cash in Lieu of Commodities (CASH) and
Commodity Letter of Credit (CLOC) demonstration projects as a means of examining alternatives to the current commodity
distribution system for schools. Under CASH, schools receive their per-meal commodity support entitlement (currently
$.14) in the form of a direct cash payment. CLOC provides commodity support through a Letter of Credit which must be
used to purchase specific commodities that mirror the Department's commodity purchases. Fifty-nine school districts
participate in the CASH/CLOC demonstration. The current project authorization expires at the end of Fiscal Year
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported CASH/CLOC, while a small number opposed it. Others implicitly favored the current
commodity distribution system if more healthful commodities can be provided. These commenters would support alternatives
only in the event that the current commodity system cannot be strengthened and improved. The Department intends to
continue and expand efforts already underway to improve the commodity program. Moreover, the Department does not
have the statutory authority to address the CASH/CLOC issue through the rulemaking process.

Guiding Principles and Framework for Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Improving the nutritional standards of school meals is our national health responsibility. There is no question
that diet is linked to health and that chronic disease often begins in childhood. Since eating habits are firmly established
by age 12, it is essential that dietary patterns be formed early. What children eat helps determine not only how healthy
they are as children, but how healthy they will be as adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Updating our nutrition standards and streamlining the administration of school meals programs reinforces President
Clinton's priorities for health care reform and government reinvention. Five principles are at the core of our vision
and grow out of our analysis of public comments and the participation of those who hold a stake in a healthy future for
our children. These principles are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Healthy children:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Our goal is to provide our nation's children with access to school meal programs that promote their health, prevent
disease, and meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customer appeal:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We understand that if food doesn't look good or taste good, children will not eat it. We must involve students, parents,
teachers, and the food and agriculture community in any change through a national nutrition education campaign,
using the media that children and parents understand and speaking in the language that they speak.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flexibility: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have to reduce the burden of paperwork, streamline reporting systems, recognize regional and economic differences
and offer schools different approaches to designing menus that meet the Dietary Guidelines. To do this, we must use
technology more effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Investing in people: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We must provide schools and school food service directors with the training and technical assistance they need to
bring about nutrition changes in the school meals programs and build the nutrition skills of our nation's children,
and thereby improve their health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building partnerships: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To meet our national health responsibility to American children and to increase cost effectiveness, we must forge
partnerships throughout the public and private sectors. This includes continuing collaborative efforts with our
federal partners at the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services and building bridges to consumer and
industry groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guided by these five principles, USDA constructed a comprehensive, integrated framework for action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eating for Health: Meeting the Dietary Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
School meal nutrition standards will be updated and expanded to include the Dietary Guidelines for Americans with
standards for fat and saturated fat as well as required nutrients. The current meal planning system which requires
that certain types of foods be served in certain quantities will be replaced by a more flexible system that allows schools
to concentrate on serving a variety of foods in amounts that are suitable for children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Making Food Choices: Nutrition Education, Training and Technical Assistance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not enough to change the food on the plate. We must also provide the knowledge that enables children to make choices
that lead to a nutritious diet and improved health. It also is vital that local meal providers receive training on how
to improve meal quality. This dual initiative to educate children and assist meal providers offers many opportunities
to influence both what foods are offered by schools and what foods are eaten by children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Maximizing Resources: Getting the Best Value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By marshalling all available resources and strengthening partnerships with our state and local cooperators, we
will stretch food dollars and cut costs while improving the nutritional profile of commodities. We will enhance access
to locally grown commodities and better use regional agricultural resources. And we will provide assistance, training
and the power of federal purchases to help school administrators manage school meals programs in a more cost-effective
manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Managing for the Future: Streamlined Administration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is necessary to reduce paperwork and administrative burdens of local administrators. We will streamline procedures
and emphasize administrative flexibility to free state and local food program managers to concentrate on nutrition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Framework for Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory proposals that follow are intended to support the Department's goal of promoting the long term health
of children through updating nutrition standards to include the Dietary Guidelines. In addition, several of the
proposals reflect the Administration's desire to streamline administration of government programs through increasing
State and local flexibility and making better use of advanced technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to recognize, however, that these regulatory proposals are but one part of the Department's overall
plan for improving the quality of school meals. The Guiding Principles and Framework for Action described above grew
out of public comment and the recognition that it is not enough just to change the food served to children on their plates.
What is required is a much broader approach that includes significant administrative actions initiated by the Executive
Branch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Department is committed to investing in people_both the State and local professionals who operate
the program and the children who participate in it. This investment will take the form of nutrition education to build
the skills necessary to make healthful food choices, training for food service workers and technical assistance.
The Department has already committed existing funds toward the development of improved recipes for school meal service,
a computerized data bank of standard nutritional values for foods served in the school meals program, and a demonstration
project on the use of Nutrient Standard Menu Planning. On the nutrition education front, the Department has already
announced a strategy that includes challenge grants to localities to develop community-based, comprehensive approaches
to nutrition education and a nutrition publication directed at grade school children. The Department is also assisting
local school food service professionals in working with chefs, farmers and others to harness all of their unique skills
to make school meals appealing and healthful, and to educate children about food and cooking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Looking to the future, the Administration's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 1995 contains a request for $18.4 million
in additional funds to support nutrition education and technical assistance. Plans for these funds include extensive
training for local school meal providers on how to plan and prepare nutritious and appealing meals as well as launching
a national media campaign directed at building children's skills at making wise food choices for life-long health.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All these initiatives are being undertaken with the support of USDA's Federal partners at DHHS and DOE. This collaboration
extends to addressing issues of common concern such as reducing redundant paperwork requirements, integrating
nutrition education into school curriculum and exploring ways to integrate the school meals program more fully into
the school environment and into school-based health initiatives. Within the Department, there are also plans to
strengthen ties with the Food Service Management Institute and, indeed, with private organizations so that as many
resources and as much creativity as possible can be brought to bear on this important issue of improving children's
health through sound nutrition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Efficient and effective government requires that the use of the finite resources available to administer the programs
be maximized. Therefore, part of the Department's Framework for Action is to maximize resources wherever possible.
One of the important avenues to pursue in this regard is effective use of the USDA commodity program. The Department
recognizes that commodity foods are a significant component of the meals that are served to children and, therefore,
need to be as nutritious as possible. A wide variety of foods ranging from grain products to fruits and vegetables to
meat, poultry and fish are already being offered. The Department plans to continue to offer this wide array of foods.
Improvement is always possible, however, and the Department intends to intensify its review of purchase specifications
to assure that products are as low in fat and sodium as possible while still maintaining palatability for consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the USDA agencies that are key partners in delivering commodities are working with one another, as well
as with industry, to modify labels on commodities that go to the schools to include nutrition information, and to develop
new products, like low-fat cheeses, that will provide the schools with more flexibility to meet the Dietary Guidelines.
This latter effort will have a salutary effect not only on the commodity program, but could also prove useful in providing
schools with a larger array of healthful products to choose from when they make their local purchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because schools do purchase significant amounts of food independent of the commodity program, the Department is
also considering various other strategies for improving the quality and effectiveness of those purchases. For example,
a pilot test is planned for School Year 1994 with the Department of Defense to procure produce for the school meal programs.
Through this project, schools can obtain a much wider variety of fresh produce than USDA can provide directly. The
Department is also working to facilitate interaction among schools, State Departments' of Agriculture, small resource
farmers and farmers' markets. This has great potential for improving the quality of the foods used by those schools
that are close to particular growing areas as well as providing important new markets for small farmers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Department is committed to improving the quality of school meals and the health of the nation's children
through a variety of approaches. There is complete recognition that success can only be achieved over time and through
the efforts of the Federal government working in concert with State and local administering agencies, industry,
the Congress, a variety of private organizations and the ultimate beneficiaries of the school meals programs_children
and their parents.

Proposed Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Expanding and Updating Nutrition Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's mission continues to be to carry out the declared policy of Congress to ``safeguard the health and
well-being of the Nation's children.'' In order to meet this goal, school meals must change to reflect the scientific
consensus that is articulated in the Dietary Guidelines. Therefore, the Department believes that current nutrition
standards must be expanded to incorporate the Dietary Guidelines in the NSLP and SBP regulations and is proposing
to amend &sect;&sect;210.10 and 220.8 to require that school meals meet the applicable recommendations of the Dietary
Guidelines including the quantified standards established for fat and saturated fat. Proposed regulations would
also require schools to make an effort to reduce sodium and cholesterol, increase dietary fiber and serve a variety
of foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more comprehensive discussion of implementation occurs later in this preamble, including the time frames that
would be followed for the shift to the updated nutrition standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the proposed regulations would include the basic provision that school meals meet nutrition standards over
a one week menu cycle, the proposed revision would also require meals to provide a level of nutrients for specified
age groups rather than meet minimum amounts of specific food items for each age group as is currently required. Sections
210.10 and 220.8, therefore, would incorporate nutrition standards for various age/grade groups based on the RDA
for the following nutrients: Protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium as well as the energy allowances for
calories. Sections 210.10 and 220.8 would also set the maximum levels of calories from fat and saturated fat at 30 percent
and 10 percent of calories, respectively.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although RDA have been established for more nutrients than indicated above, the Department has chosen to monitor
only those listed because these are key nutrients that promote growth and development which are consistent with those
required in the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535). The proposal would also require
schools to decrease the levels of sodium and cholesterol and increase the amount of dietary fiber in school meals.
The Department is not proposing specific levels for these components, since numeric targets are not established
by the current Dietary Guidelines. However, progress in this area could be assessed through a variety of ways including
gradual reductions in sodium, and if necessary, cholesterol levels, and increased use of vegetables, fruits and
grain products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wishes to note that the Dietary Guidelines are designed for persons aged two and over. The Department
will maintain current meal patterns for children in the zero to eleven months and one to two year age groups. For children
who are two years old, schools will have the option of using the minimum calorie and nutrient requirements for school
meals for children ages three-six or developing a separate set of nutrient and calorie levels for this age group. Finally,
because compliance with the Dietary Guidelines will not be required until School Year 1998&hyph;1999, which begins
July 1, 1998, the current meal patterns and quantities will be retained temporarily and will be redesignated &sect;210.10a
for the NSLP and &sect;220.8a for the SBP. This proposal does not apply to infant meal patterns and meal supplements;
therefore, the appropriate sections of the redesignated &sect;210.10a and &sect;220.8a will continue to be followed
by schools serving infants and meal supplements.

New Approaches to Menu Planning: Nutrient Standard Menu Planning and Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Schools must currently meet a meal pattern which specifies minimum amounts (by age group) of the five food items which
must be offered in order to receive reimbursement for meals. An alternate approach that provides an excellent tool
for improving the nutritional quality of school meals is Nutrient Standard Menu Planning (NSMP). Under NSMP, the
menu is developed through the nutrient analysis of all foods offered over a school week to ensure that meals meet specific
nutrition standards for key nutrients, and meet recommended levels of fat and saturated fat. Other dietary components
that will be analyzed are cholesterol, sodium and dietary fiber. However, the Department recognizes that some school
food authorities may not have the computer capability or the degree of access to technical support necessary to independently
conduct NSMP. In these circumstances, the Department is proposing to allow school food authorities to use a modified
form of NSMP entitled Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning (ANSMP). Use of ANSMP would allow development and
analysis of menus by other entities while still applying the essentials of NSMP. (A more complete discussion of ANSMP
may be found later in this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under NSMP, the menu planner is expected to use effective techniques to provide menus that meet the updated nutrition
standards. All menu items (i.e., any single food or combination of food) or other foods offered as part of the reimbursable
meal will be counted toward meeting the nutrition standards. An exception to this is foods of minimal nutritional
value, as provided for in &sect;210.11(a)(2) or &sect;220.12(b), which are not offered as part of a menu item in a reimbursable
meal. A definition of ``menu item'' is proposed to be added to &sect;210.2 and &sect;220.2 to expand upon the current
definitions of food item and food component that are used in various sections of the regulations concerned with point
of service meal counts. The definition would also specify that one menu item offered must be an entree and one must be
fluid milk. Further, as discussed later in this preamble, the Department is proposing that the entree must be selected
as part of a reimbursable lunch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Menu items will be analyzed based on production levels to more accurately reflect the overall nutritional composition
of the menu. Menus will be planned, analyzed for nutrient content and adjusted as needed to ensure that production
and selection trends are considered and nutrition standards are met. A discussion of NSMP software programs and the
National Nutrient Database for Child Nutrition Programs is provided later in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of NSMP and ANSMP is two-fold: To provide a flexible way to plan menus using certain nutrient levels, not
on limited food items and amounts, and to measure how well meals are meeting nutrition standards. The Department is
proposing to adopt NSMP and ANSMP by amending &sect;210.10(k) and (l) of the regulations to incorporate NSMP and ANSMP
for the NSLP and &sect;220.8(j) and (k) for the SBP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While school meals will be expected to comply with the updated nutrition standards and to be planned through NSMP or
ANSMP, the Department wishes to emphasize that compliance monitoring would stress technical assistance to enable
the school to achieve the standards. While all meals offered during a menu cycle that fail to meet the established nutrition
standards could technically be subject to an overclaim, the regulations will require State agencies to establish
claims only when school food authorities refuse, not simply fail, to take corrective action. It is the Department's
intent that every effort be made to provide nutritious meals to children rather than taking punitive actions which
could undermine this initiative. Further discussion on this point may be found later in this preamble in the section
on monitoring.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Nutrition Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since information on the nutritional composition of the menu is readily available as a result of NSMP/ANSMP, the Department
is proposing to amend &sect;210.10(n) to encourage school food authorities to make public disclosure of the nutrients
contained in their meals. Many school food authorities, recognizing the benefits of nutrition disclosure, already
make this information available in the classroom, on menus or by notifying local media. These benefits include: (1)
An increased awareness on the part of students and parents on the nutritional quality of school meals; (2) depending
on how the information is disclosed, an enhanced ability for students and parents to make healthful choices, and;
(3) increased support for the school meal programs through recognition of the improved quality of school meals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes the differing needs of school food authorities, and, therefore, is not proposing to mandate
nutrition disclosure. The Department believes this information should be readily available to students and parents
without their having to request it. In providing this information, school food authorities would take into account
local factors such as nutrition analysis capabilities and student/parent requests. For example, the school may
disclose information either: (1) Developed through the weekly nutrient analysis of meals; (2) based on sample meals
offered each day, or; (3) provided along with food item(s) offered in the cafeteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also wishes to emphasize that school food authorities that make this disclosure would not experience
an additional administrative burden. The information being disclosed is a product of NSMP/ANSMP, and the school
food authority can determine, for itself, the most efficient means of disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although nutrition disclosure will not be required, the Department recognizes that many school food authorities
are already providing this information to students and parents, and strongly encourages others to make public such
information. The Department would also like to solicit comments regarding nutrition disclosure, particularly
effective nutrition disclosure approaches; which nutrition information to disclose; and disclosure's value as
a tool to help children choose nutritious meals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, the Department recognizes that some school food authorities may not have the resources or capacity
to independently conduct NSMP. For these school food authorities, the optional method of ANSMP is an alternative
approach to NSMP which is proposed in &sect;210.10(l) for the NSLP and &sect;220.8(k) for the SBP. School food authorities
would draw on the expertise of others to provide menu cycles, adjusted for local needs and preferences. The provided
menu would be analyzed to ensure that it meets the required nutrition standards. The menu analysis must be consistent
with the local preferences, production records, preparation techniques and food procurement specifications.
The provided menu cycles could be developed in a variety of ways_by States, consortiums of school food authorities,
by consultants or even by the Federal government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure consistency with the nutrient analysis of the provided menu, the following components must be standardized:
Recipes, food product specifications, and preparation techniques. To accurately reflect the nutrient analysis
of the menu as offered, the provided menu must be analyzed and adjusted to the quantities of food prepared and served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the school, in conjunction with the entity providing the menu cycle, must periodically review their
application of ANSMP to ensure the suitability of the selected menu cycle and the accuracy with which it is being managed.
(i.e., Are the prescribed procurement specifications and preparation techniques being followed and are on-going
production adjustments made to reflect student choices, thereby resulting in reanalysis of the menu?) It is also
possible that standard menus, recipes and procurement specifications could be provided by the Federal government,
then adjusted and reanalyzed at the State or local level as necessary. The Department is most interested in receiving
comments regarding the usefulness of this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Reimbursable Meals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Schools currently receive reimbursement for each meal served to children that meets the requirements of the lunch
or breakfast meal pattern and, if applicable, the offer versus serve option. Basically, the required components
(meat/meat alternate, two or more servings of a vegetable and/or fruit, bread/bread alternate and milk) must be offered
and a minimum number of items must be selected. In order to determine if the meal chosen by the child is reimbursable,
the cashier observes, at the point of service, if the proper number of components are taken.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under NSMP and ANSMP, a meal will be reimbursable if at least three menu items (one must be an entree and one fluid milk)
are being offered, and if at least three menu items are selected. For reimbursable lunches, one of the menu items selected
must be an entree. If the school participates in offer versus serve, a meal will be reimbursable if at least three menu
items are offered and two menu items are selected. Again, for reimbursable lunches, one of these two menu items must
be an entree. For the purpose of point of service counts, this proposal will not change the basic concept of a reimbursable
meal. Cashiers will continue to determine if the proper number of menu items was selected and, for the lunch service,
that one of the menu items is an entree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for requiring that one of the selected items for lunch be an entree stems from the Department's concern that
the school lunches children consume provide an adequate amount of calories and other essential nutrients. Traditionally,
the most significant nutrition contribution in a school lunch comes from the entree. Therefore, this proposal is
being offered as a way of assuring that children (particularly those children that participate in offer versus serve)
select and, hopefully, consume the most nutritious lunch possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that this proposal deviates from current requirements which do not stipulate that the
child must select an entree for lunch. The Department would be concerned if commenters believe this restriction inhibits
the flexibility that this proposed rule was designed to promote. For example, if children were inhibited from selecting
lunches that were consistent with ethnic or vegetarian preferences, or if plate waste was a potential by-product.
Therefore, the Department is particularly interested in receiving comments on and alternatives to this proposed
requirement, including comments on whether the minimum number of menu items, both in terms of the standard meal and
the offer versus serve option, is adequate even with requiring selection of an entree for lunch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not proposing to extend the requirement that a reimbursable meal contain an entree to the SBP. This
decision was made due to the nature of the breakfast meal and the possible confusion that may result by trying to define
an ``entree'' for the breakfast program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Point of Service
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While implementation of the updated nutrition standards affects the content of meals, it will not affect basic counting
methodology. Cashiers will continue to take counts at the point of service on the basis of the number of menu items selected.
Consequently, food service personnel will be able to recognize individual reimbursable meals, as they will not differ
substantially from current practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, under NSMP/ANSMP, point of service identification of a reimbursable meal may be easier as cashiers would
no longer need to determine which of the required components discussed above have been meet by a particular food item,
such as a pot pie, which contains a number of different ingredients. Under NSMP/ANSMP, a pot pie would be the entree
which is simply a required one menu item for claiming purposes.

Preparation for Implementation of NSMP and ANSMP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is currently sponsoring a demonstration project to evaluate the optimum use of NSMP as a way for school
meals to meet the Dietary Guidelines while ensuring that students also receive needed nutrients and calories. One
of the main objectives of this demonstration is to assist the Department in identifying the technical assistance
necessary to most efficiently and effectively implement NSMP. This approach shifts the focus from the traditional
specifics of a meal pattern to meals containing a combination of foods that meet the nutritional needs of school-age
children, by age group, over a school week. Under NSMP and ANSMP, school food authorities will have more flexibility
in deciding what other foods will be offered as long as the nutrition standards are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Flexibility of NSMP and ANSMP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed menu development and analysis system has a number of advantages over the current meal pattern, and the
Department believes the proposed change to adopt NSMP and ANSMP will greatly assist local school food authorities
with implementation of the proposed nutrition standards. With NSMP and ANSMP, there is greater flexibility in food
selections and portion sizes because meals are not limited to specific types of foods in specified portions. Further,
menus with cultural or other special preferences will be easier to design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSMP and ANSMP would also eliminate the need for cumbersome and often confusing food crediting decisions such as whether
taco chips or just taco pieces could be considered as a bread alternate or whether yogurt can be allowed as part of a reimbursable
meal. The complex Child Nutrition labeling program, which requires the Department to determine how commercial products
are credited as food components under the meal pattern, would be substantially reduced in scope or perhaps even eliminated
entirely. More nutrient dense items could be added to menus under NSMP, and the nutritional contributions of all foods
offered to the child can be recognized. The Department also wishes to emphasize that all nutrients offered to the child
are counted in the analysis, including those in foods such as yogurt and desserts which do not presently count toward
a reimbursable meal. Of course, the most important aspect of both NSMP and ANSMP is that school food authorities will
have an accurate, practical on-going means of determining if the nutrition standards are being met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Fortification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal does not require school food authorities to distinguish between naturally occurring nutrients and
those that are added through fortification. However, the Department is committed to the principle that the preferred
source of adequate nutrition is a meal comprised of a variety of conventional foods, as recommended in the Dietary
Guidelines, rather than one containing formulated fortified foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has been unable to develop a practical method for regulating or monitoring fortification. For example,
it is virtually impossible to calculate the amounts of nutrients added to food items and those naturally occurring,
especially for food items with numerous ingredients. Although a comparison could be made between a fortified item
and a similar item that had no added nutrients, there may not be an identical product on which to base the comparison.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes the standards as outlined under NSMP that meals contain adequate calories and that at least
three menu items be offered, as well as the higher expense of engineered foods, will inhibit excessive reliance on
highly fortified foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department welcomes commenters to address the use of fortified foods in school meal programs, particularly whether
there are practical ways to control over-use of fortification, the degree to which this should be a concern, and potential
impacts on the character of school meals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that if NSMP/ANSMP is implemented on a nationwide basis, the current regulatory requirements on
the use of alternate foods would no longer be necessary. During the interim and where the meal patterns are still in
use, these regulations would remain in force.

Operational Aspects of NSMP and ANSMP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Nutrient Database for the Child Nutrition Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to conduct nutrient analysis, data on the nutrients contained in a wide range of foods must be available. To
meet this need, the Department has developed a centralized National Nutrient Database to allow for accurate nutrient
analysis of the menus and recipes used in the NSLP and SBP. The National Nutrient Database contains information on
the nutritional composition of: (1) Commodities supplied through the Department; (2) standard reference food items
which are used in the SBP and NSLP; (3) Quantity Recipes for School Food Service developed by the Department, and; (4)
convenience, processed and pre-prepared foods from food manufacturers. The Department is working closely with
the food industry to obtain nutrient analysis of many common food products used by schools for inclusion in the database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of NSMP, as opposed to ANSMP, is dependent upon the school or school food authority's ability to
analyze the nutrient content of foods. Therefore, the Department is proposing to require that the National Nutrient
Database be incorporated into all school food service software systems used for menu and recipe analysis under NSMP.
Under ANSMP, the database would be used by the entity providing assistance with nutrition analysis. The Department
is making the database available free of charge to participating school food authorities and to computer software
companies to develop school food service software programs. The database will be regularly maintained and updated
to ensure that the information is as accurate and current as possible. School food authorities would be expected to
incorporate these updates into their own software as they are made available. It should be noted that a preliminary
version of the Department's database is now available. Information on how to obtain it can be secured from the Department's
Child Nutrition Database Hotline at (301) 436&hyph;3536.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
School Food Service Software Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The computer software industry has many nutrient analysis software programs on the market. Few of these, however,
are specific to the school programs and do not contain the types of foods, descriptions, weights and measurements
used in these programs. Moreover, the results of nutrient analysis can vary dramatically depending on which software
package is being used. Nutrient analysis must be based on standardized specifications to ensure accuracy. Therefore,
the Department has also developed software specifications for NSMP. The overall objective of any software system
used for this purpose is to adapt advanced data automation technology to simplify completion of the mathematical
and analytical tasks associated with NSMP. The software specifications include menu planning, nutritional analysis
of menus and recipes, and data management reports presented in a comprehensive, simplified and user-friendly manner.
To ensure that school food authorities are using a software package which meets the Department's specifications,
school food authorities will be required to use a software system that has been evaluated by FNS and, as submitted,
been determined to meet the minimum requirements established by FNS. However, such review does not constitute endorsement
by FNS or USDA. This proposed requirement is found in &sect;210.10(k)(1)(ii) for the NSLP and &sect;220.8(j)(1)(ii)
for the SBP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Weighted Averages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some food items are more popular than others and, thus, will be selected by school children more frequently. To accurately
perform an assessment of the nutritional composition of reimbursable meals offered, nutrient analysis must be based
on production levels of foods offered, as production levels are an indication of foods actually selected. For example,
a menu item which is chosen frequently (and therefore more portions are prepared) will contribute more nutrients
to the meal than a menu item chosen less frequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculation method for computing a weighted nutritional analysis will require the school food authority to enter
the following information into the selected software program the menu item; portion size; projected servings of
each menu item; and the projected number of reimbursable meals each day for the school week. It should be noted that
the software specifications discussed above are designed to easily perform weighting calculations. This provision
is proposed in &sect;210.10 (k)(2) and &sect;210.10 (k)(4) for the NSLP and &sect;220.8 (j)(2) and (j)(4).

Definition of School Week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new definition would be added for ``school week'' to indicate that, for NSMP and ANSMP, a minimum of three days and
a maximum of seven days must be included. This is because the nutrition analysis is proposed to be an average of the reimbursable
meals served over the course of a week. To ensure common understanding of the terms NSMP and ANSMP, a proposed definition
would be added to &sect;210.2 and &sect;220.2 explaining the term ``school week.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Transition to NSMP and ANSMP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that school food authorities will need technical assistance in order to implement these
changes efficiently. The Department is conducting NSMP demonstration projects in several school food authorities,
and the ongoing experiences gained from these will be shared as part of the overall assistance to school food authorities
to phase in NSMP and ANSMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also plans to provide extensive training and technical assistance to State and local agencies as they
prepare to implement NSMP and ANSMP. As noted earlier in this preamble, the Department has requested specific funding
in the Administration's Fiscal Year 1995 budget for this purpose as well as to fund other technical assistance and
nutrition education activities. Other projects to support the move towards updated nutrition standards are already
being undertaken within existing resources, including modification of more than fifty recipes to include more fruits,
vegetables, and grain products and to decrease fat levels, and collaboration with the National Food Service Management
Institute. Finally, the Department is committed to working with State agencies to target Nutrition Education and
Training (NET) resources more intensely toward implementation of the Dietary Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation would require school food authorities to adopt the updated nutrition standards and NSMP
or ANSMP no later than July 1, 1998, the start of School Year 1998&hyph;99. However, school food authorities are encouraged
to begin working towards full implementation of the updated nutrition standards as soon as practicable after publication
of a final rule or to even use NSMP, ANSMP, or nutrient-based menu analysis in conjunction with the current meal patterns
prior to the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies would need to determine when school food authorities are ready to begin NSMP or ANSMP and would, of course,
provide training and technical assistance to help school food authorities whenever they begin implementing this
procedure. In determining when to begin NSMP in a particular school or school food authority, States should evaluate
their capabilities both in terms of computer technology and availability of other technical resources. States will
also need to evaluate implementation on an on-going basis to determine if any adjustments are needed and to provide
support when start-up difficulties occur. The Department is not establishing a specific procedure for determining
the readiness of school food authorities to phase in NSMP or ANSMP. Rather, the Department believes State agencies
are in the best position to determine if a school food authority is ready to begin the shift to NSMP or ANSMP and will be
able to respond to the wide range of situations that may occur and to concentrate on achieving the goal. This approach
frees State agencies from assuring that a particular process is followed and allows them the flexibility to invest
their time and efforts as they judge best.

Monitoring Compliance With Updated Nutrition Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also proposes to modify the monitoring requirements to include compliance with the updated nutrition
standards. Currently, states monitor compliance with meal pattern components and quantities on a per-meal basis.
On the day of a review, the lunch service is observed to ensure that all required food items are offered and, if applicable,
that children accept the minimum number of components stipulated both under the standard meal service and the offer
versus serve option. Meal services that offer fewer than the five required food items are disallowed for Federal reimbursement,
as are meals for which the child has not taken the minimum number of items under the offer versus serve option. States
also examine menus and production records for the review period to ensure that all components were available, and
that sufficient quantities were offered. Thus, a direct correlation exists between the meal service offered and
the meals taken on a given day and the allowable reimbursement for those meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under NSMP and ANSMP, Federal reimbursement will continue to be predicated upon similar factors. As noted earlier
in this preamble, under NSMP and ANSMP, schools will continue to offer a minimum number of menu items, and children
must accept a minimum number of items. Meals which do not meet these requirements will not be eligible for reimbursement.
However, to allow school food authorities adequate time to move towards full implementation of NSMP or ANSMP, school
food authorities that implement prior to School Year 1998&hyph;1999 will be exempt from Coordinated Review Effort
(CRE) Performance Standard 2 on reimbursable meals containing the required food items/components in &sect;210.18(g)(2)
if they are scheduled for an administrative review prior to School Year 1998&hyph;1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, in addition to meeting the minimums for the number of menu items, the reimbursable meals offered
over a school week must also collectively meet the updated nutrition standards established. To determine compliance
with the nutrition standards, State agencies will need to closely examine school food authority's nutrient analysis
in the course of a review. While this is a much more precise examination than in past practice, it continues the concept
of ensuring that the entire food service, not just an individual meal, conforms to program requirements. State agencies
must also observe the meal service to determine if meals claimed for reimbursement contain the appropriate number
and type of menu items. The Department is proposing to amend &sect;210.19, Additional Responsibilities, to outline
review requirements for nutrition standards. The Department is proposing to add the compliance requirements for
the nutrition standards to this section rather than to &sect;210.18, Administrative Reviews, in order to allow for
operational experience and corrective action prior to any imposition of fiscal action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
State Agency Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following summarizes the State agency's responsibilities under the Department's proposal for general program
management, including taking fiscal action against school food authorities that consistently refuse to meet program
requirements. While State agencies would probably combine a determination of how the nutrition standards and NSMP/ANSMP
are being met with the cyclical administrative review, the Department is also proposing to provide State agencies
with flexibility to conduct these important evaluations at other times such as during technical assistance visits
or even as a separate, special assessment. However, assessments of compliance with the nutrition standards must
be conducted no less frequently than administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed by the Department, State agencies would assess the nutrient analyses for the last completed school week.
The purpose would be to determine if the school food authority is applying the correct methodology and is properly
conducting the NSMP or ANSMP based on the actual menu cycle including any substitutions. The State agency would also
review the menus and production records to determine if they correspond to the information used to conduct NSMP or
ANSMP.

Corrective Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If it is indicated that the school food authority is not conducting NSMP accurately or properly applying ANSMP, if
the school week's meals, as offered, do not comply with nutrition standards, or if the meal observation identified
a significant number of meals that did not meet the definition of a reimbursable meal, the school food authority would
be required to take appropriate corrective action to achieve compliance. However, at this time, no claim would be
established if the failure to comply was not intentional. (Intentional violations are discussed later in this preamble.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 16(b) of the CNA, 42 U.S.C. 1785(b), the Secretary of Agriculture is given authority to settle,
adjust or waive any claims under both the NSLA or the CNA if to do so would serve the purposes of either Act. The Department
recognizes that the transition to NSMP and ANSMP will not in every instance be completed without problems and unforeseen
circumstances to be surmounted. The Department expects State agencies to act quickly to rectify any problems found
and to monitor any corrective action undertaken. In the interests of facilitating the transition to NSMP/ANSMP,
the Secretary is proposing to exercise his authority to settle, adjust and waive claims by not requiring State agencies
to disallow payment or collect overpayments resulting from meals which do not meet the nutrition standards of the
regulations as long as State agencies are satisfied that such deviations from the nutrition standards were not intentional
and that the school food authority is working towards successful completion of a acceptable corrective action plan
in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department stresses that this proposal does not establish specific steps or time frames for corrective action.
State agencies, as a result of their evaluation of the school food authority, are in the best position to establish
corrective action goals and time frames, working in partnership with local school food authorities. The Department
believes that State agencies and school food authorities need flexibility in developing a corrective action plan
and is, therefore, providing such flexibility in this proposal. Further, in recognition of the fact that timely and
effective corrective action is in the best interest of all, the Department intends to incorporate review of this area
into its management evaluation activities at the State level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department would like to once again emphasize that, under this proposal, compliance with the updated nutrition
standards is of paramount importance. First, corrective action will be required if a meal service does not meet the
nutrition standards. The State agency cannot overlook these shortcomings and must ensure that the meal service is
improved as stipulated in the corrective action plan. Secondly, the State will be required to monitor the school's
corrective action efforts. In most cases, monitoring would include reviewing production records, menus and computer
analyses submitted by the school food authority and providing any support indicated by such a review. When a school
food authority refuses to make a good faith effort to comply with the terms of the corrective action plan, the State
agency would be required to establish a claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Exception to Claim Establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposal, State agencies would require corrective action for meals not meeting the nutrition standards,
but would receive reimbursement for those meals. This procedure represents a significant means of easing the transition
to and operation of the updated nutrition standards. Section 8 of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1757, and section 4(b)(1)(D)
of the CNA, 42 U.S.C. 1773 (b)(1)(D), clearly provide that reimbursement for meals served is available only for those
meals that meet Program requirements. Further, section 12(g) of the NSLA, 42 U.S.C. 1760(g), continues to provide
for Federal criminal penalties for certain intentional Program violations under either the NSLA or the CNA. The Department
is concerned that the corrective action provision not be construed by State agencies or school food authorities as
an invitation to relax efforts to comply with the nutritional or administrative review requirements of &sect;&sect;210.10,
210.10a, 210.18 and 210.19. The institution of corrective action would not be a sufficient remedy by itself in an instance
in which a State agency determined that school officials had intentionally failed to meet the nutrition standards
required by NSMP. In these situations, while the State agency would initiate corrective action, it must also disallow
claims for reimbursement for the substandard meals and, in very severe cases, consider referring the matter to the
Department for criminal prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While continued refusal to take corrective action could result in loss of Federal funding, this provision is not intended
to be punitive when school food authorities are acting in good faith to comply with the nutrition standards. The Department
is far more concerned about correcting these situations than it is with pursuing fiscal action. The Department's
foremost goal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that children are provided with the most nutritious meals possible. Consequently, the emphasis in this
process is on corrective action and technical assistance. If school food authorities implement appropriate corrective
action and make satisfactory progress toward compliance, no fiscal action would be required.

Streamlined Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also proposing to streamline program administration by allowing State agencies and school food
authorities flexibility in three important areas. The first provision would extend the Coordinated Review Effort
(CRE) review cycle from 4 to 5 years. The Department's experience with CRE indicates that a one-year extension in the
cycle would not adversely affect accountability, but it would result in a 20 percent decrease in the number of reviews
currently conducted in any given year. While the exact reduction in burden would vary from State to State, the Department
expects this decrease would provide the States with additional flexibility to enable them to continue to improve
school meals. Section 210.18(c) is proposed to be amended to include this change.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second provision eliminates the regulatory requirement for a specific type of edit check on daily meal counts
contained in &sect;210.8(a)(2) for schools where the most recent CRE review did not identify meal counting and claiming
problems. Currently, the edit check provision requires that each school food authority compare each school's daily
meal count with data such as the number of children eligible for free, reduced price or paid meals multiplied by an attendance
factor. This check is intended to ensure that monthly claims for reimbursement are based on reasonable and accurate
counts of meals offered on any day of operation to eligible children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes, however, that school food authorities that have demonstrated, through the CRE review,
the accuracy of their meal counts and claims should be provided an optional approach to specific edit checks. This
proposal would establish a system whereby these school food authorities could develop and implement their own systems
of internal controls designed to ensure the accuracy of claims for reimbursement. This system would then be submitted
to the State agency for review. If the State agency's review determined that the proposed method constituted an accurate
internal control, no further action would be required, and the school food authority's own proposed internal controls
would remain in effect. However, if the State agency concluded that the suggested system of internal controls was
inadequate, the school food authority would be required to modify its procedures accordingly. In addition, if during
the course of a CRE review or other oversight activity of the school food authority, it is determined that the internal
controls were ineffective, the specific, regulatory edit check would replace their system until a future regularly
scheduled CRE review indicates there are no meal count problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would virtually eliminate the requirement for a specific edit check for school food authorities with
accurate meal counts and claims measured by the CRE review and replace it with a more flexible procedure to allow these
school food authorities to design and implement a system that is streamlined for their particular circumstances.
However, this proposal also maintains the necessary specificity of an edit check for school food authorities found
to have meal counting and claiming violations. Further it provides for State agency oversight of accountability
procedures and a ready mechanism, if needed, to substitute a Federally-defined procedure to ensure accurate claims
for reimbursement. The Department believes that program integrity must be maintained by requiring specific criteria
when review results indicate problems or failure of the school food authority's alternative system. Section 210.8(a)(2)
and (a)(3) would be modified to reflect these proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is especially interested in receiving comments on this provision. Commenters should address the
flexibility this proposed provision allows well-managed school food authorities and any implementation issues
this poses. In addition, the Department would be interested in receiving alternative proposals that would accomplish
the desired balance between local flexibility and sound accountability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third area that the Department is addressing to reduce paperwork at the school food authority level is the requirement
in &sect;210.15(b)(4) that distinct records be maintained to document the nonprofit status of the school food service.
These records are the accounts which any enterprise needs to maintain in the normal course of conducting business
(i.e., receipts, costs, etc.). Therefore, since these kinds of records are a necessary part of a school food authority's
own accountability system and, in many cases, are required by State laws, the Department does not consider it necessary
for the program regulations to mandate this recordkeeping requirement. It is important to emphasize that the school
food authority would still have to be operated on a nonprofit basis. This proposal is only amending the requirements
for documentation of nonprofitability. This proposal would amend &sect;210.14(c) and &sect;210.15(b) to include
this change. In the event that a question or dispute arises in connection with whether a nonprofit school food service
has been properly operated, the burden of proof still be upon the school food authority to demonstrate that the school
food service is being operated on a nonprofit basis.

Length of Meal Periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, many commenters expressed concern that children be given sufficient time in which to eat, particularly
if larger portion sizes are to be served. The Department also recognizes the need to balance the time for academics
with the time to receive and eat school meals, especially lunch. Although the Department has no authority in this area,
school food service directors are strongly encouraged to work with other school officials to ensure that adequate
meal service times and facilities are provided. Likewise, the Department will continue to work with DOEd to solicit
support in the education community to ensure that educators and school administrators understand the importance
of students having adequate time to eat.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To indicate its concern in this area, the Department is proposing, in &sect;210.10(i), to recommend that school food
authorities make every effort to provide adequate meal service times and periods to ensure that students can effectively
participate in the school lunch program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Changes to the School Breakfast Program Nutritional Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to facilitate uniform implementation, the Department is also proposing to amend the nutritional requirements
of the SBP to parallel the changes made to the nutritional requirements of the NSLP. The current &sect;220.8 would
be redesignated as &sect;220.8a to retain the requirements that would be in effect until implementation of the updated
nutrition standards on July 1, 1998, while &sect;220.8 would contain provisions on nutrition standards, NSMP and
ANSMP for the SBP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major differences for the SBP are that fewer calories are required and one-fourth of the RDA are to be met. A new guide
would be incorporated into &sect;220.8 to indicate the nutrition standards required for the SBP. In addition, separate
analyses for SBP and NSLP would be required to meet the different nutrition standards for each program. As previously
discussed, a reimbursable meal under the SBP will not be required to contain an entree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed earlier, this proposal requires school food authorities to serve meals through the use of NSMP or ANSMP
and be in compliance with updated nutrition standards by School Year 1998&hyph;1999 which begins on July 1, 1998.
The Department believes this schedule provides sufficient time to enable States to develop appropriate technical
assistance and guidance materials, to allow local food service staff to become familiar with the updated requirements
and to make appropriate changes in meals. There would be no mandate for school food authorities to implement the required
changes prior to July 1, 1998. In the interest of promoting children's long-term health through diet, the Department
encourages State agencies to work with school food authorities to implement as soon as possible and, in fact, as discussed
earlier, expects State agencies to approve plans for early implementation. The Department considers that early
implementation will also provide both State agencies and school food authorities with valuable experience before
mandatory implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage early implementation, compliance activities described above will not take effect before School Year
1998&hyph;1999. In the interim period, reviews and oversight activities that focus on the food service portion of
program operations will provide excellent opportunities for technical assistance and for State agencies to assess
preparation for full implementation. All other changes in this rule, including the paperwork reductions and streamlined
administration methods, could be implemented 30 days after final publication of the final rule.

than one type of lunch or when it offers a variety of menu items, foods and milk for choice as a reimbursable lunch, the
school shall offer all children the same selection regardless of whether the children are eligible for free or reduced
price lunches or pay the school food authority's designated full price. The school may establish different unit prices
for each type of lunch offered provided that the benefits made available to children eligible for free or reduced price
lunches are not affected.

exempted by FNS. With state approval, schools that serve children 1&hyph;5 years old are encouraged to divide the
service of the meal into two distinct service periods. Such schools may divide the quantities and/or menu items or
foods offered between these service periods in any combination that they choose. Schools are also encouraged to provide
an adequate number of lunch periods of sufficient length to ensure that all students have an opportunity to be served
and have ample time to consume their meals.

 (i) Menu items and foods offered as part of a reimbursable meal shall be analyzed based on portion sizes and projected
serving amounts and shall be weighted based on their proportionate contribution to the meals. Therefore, menu items
or foods more frequently selected will contribute more nutrients than menu items or foods which are less frequently
selected. Such weighting shall be done in accordance with guidance issued by FNS as well as that provided by the software
used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An analysis of all menu items and foods offered in the menu over each school week shall be computed for calories
and for each of the following nutrients: protein; vitamin A; vitamin C; iron; calcium; total fat; saturated fat; and
sodium. The analysis shall also include the dietary components of cholesterol and dietary fiber.

At a minimum, beginning with School Year 1998&hyph;99, school food authorities shall meet the nutrition standards
established in &sect;210.10(a) for reimbursable meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Beginning with School Year 1998&hyph;99, State agencies shall evaluate compliance with the established nutrition
standards over a school week. At a minimum, these evaluations shall be conducted once every 5 years and may be conducted
at the same time a school food authority is scheduled for an administrative review in accordance with &sect;210.18.
State agencies may also conduct these evaluations in conjunction with technical assistance visits, other reviews,
or separately. The State agency shall assess the nutrient analysis for the last completed school week to determine
if the school food authority is applying the methodology provided in &sect;210.10 (k) or (l), as appropriate. Part
of this assessment shall be an independent review of menus and production records to determine if they correspond
to the analysis conducted by the school food authority and if the menu, as offered, over a school week, corresponds
to the nutrition standards set forth in &sect;210.10(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the menu for the school week fails to meet any of the nutrition standards set forth in &sect;210.10(a), the school
food authority shall develop, with the assistance and concurrence of the State agency, a corrective action plan designed
to rectify those deficiencies. The State agency shall monitor the school food authority's execution of the plan to
ensure that the terms of the corrective action plan are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a school food authority fails to meet the terms of the corrective action plan, the State agency shall determine
if the school food authority is working towards compliance in good faith and, if so, may renegotiate the corrective
action plan, if warranted. However, if the school food authority has not been acting in good faith to meet the terms
of the corrective action plan and refuses to renegotiate the plan, the State agency shall determine if a disallowance
of reimbursement funds as authorized under paragraph (c) of this section is warranted.

Each State agency shall ensure that school food authorities comply with the requirements to account for all revenues
and expenditures of their nonprofit school food service. School food authorities shall meet the requirements for
the allowability of nonprofit school food service expenditures in accordance with this part and, as applicable,
7 CFR part 3015. The State agency shall ensure compliance with the requirements to limit net cash resources and shall
provide for approval of net cash resources in excess of three months' average expenditures. Each State agency shall
monitor, through review or audit or by other means, the net cash resources of the nonprofit school food service in each
school food authority participating in the Program. In the event that net cash resources exceed 3 months' average
expenditures for the school food authority's nonprofit school food service or such other amount as may be approved
in accordance with this paragraph, the State agency may require the school food authority to reduce the price children
are charged for lunches, improve food quality or take other action designed to improve the nonprofit school food service.
In the absence of any such action, the State agency shall make adjustments in the rate of reimbursement under the Program.

categories. Analysis of the menu items and foods shall be based on averages that will be weighted by production quantities
as offered to the students. Such analysis is normally done by a school or a school food authority. However, for the purposes
of Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning, menu planning and analysis is completed by other entities and shall
incorporate the production quantities needed to accommodate the specific service requirements of a particular
school or school food authority.

Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to amend the regulations outlining the nutrition standards for the National School Lunch and School
Breakfast Programs. Specifically, this proposal would update the current nutrition standards to incorporate the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which reflect medical and scientific consensus on proper nutrition as a vital
element in disease prevention and long term health promotion.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 This proposal would also adopt meal planning based on analysis of key nutrients (Nutrient Standard Menu Planning
or Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning) in lieu of the current meal pattern. These changes would be implemented
no later than July 1, 1998. In recognition of the importance of reinventing and streamlining government programs,
this proposal would also reduce various burdens associated with the school meal programs and would modify the review
requirements for the National School Lunch Program to ensure adequate oversight of the proposed updated nutrition
standards.

a. Costs To Produce a Meal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A nationally representative sample included in the School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study found an average food cost
of $0.72 for school meals prepared under the current meal pattern, rounded to the nearest whole cent. Cost data from
this study were used to estimate the cost of two weeks of sample menus developed under the requirements for Nutrient
Standard Menu Planning in the proposed rule. The analysis found an average food cost of $0.72 per meal when rounded
to the nearest whole cent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These sample menus were developed for elementary and high school students using foods and recipes common to the National
School Lunch Program (NSLP). When planning the sample menus, milk was constrained to provide eight fluid ounces with
each meal, to include milks of various fat levels and a mix of flavored and unflavored milk. Additional weeks of menus
could have been developed at similar cost, but analysis of two weeks of sample menus was deemed sufficient to demonstrate
that nutrient targets could be met at current food cost. It would also have been possible to have further reduced the
cost of the sample menus, for example by substituting lower cost items or using smaller portions of relatively expensive
items such as yogurt and fish sticks. The lower end of the cost range of sample menus was about 28 percent below the two
week average food cost. The sample menus were developed using foods and recipes already in common use in NSLP, such
as those from ``Quantity Recipes for School Food Service''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. They did not reflect the potential savings which may be realized when market forces stimulate development of new
lower fat foods and recipes. Increased demand for foods lower in fat, saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol are expected
to increase availability of these foods in the future. Such new foods and recipes should provide greater flexibility
to NSLP menu planners, and may facilitate further moderation of meal cost and food components such as sodium and cholesterol
where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sample menus include ingredients that are fresh and those that are processed into more convenient, labor saving
forms, such as frozen. Examples of processed foods used in the sample menus include popular food items, pizza and chicken
nuggets. Although these items were used less often than currently offered, by using foods and recipes common to the
NSLP, the sample menus look similar to meals currently offered to students. By their preexisting use in NSLP, school
food service personnel have already demonstrated that these food items can be prepared in the time available to prepare
current school lunches, and similarly indicate that the staff with the skills needed to prepare these foods are already
available. In addition, the equipment needed for food storage and preparation is either already available, or schools
operating under the present rules have demonstrated that such equipment can be obtained within the existing reimbursement
rates. Therefore, even though the costs of labor, equipment, and administration were not specifically analyzed,
the manner in which the sample menus were developed provides confidence that non-food costs of the NSMP sample menus
are expected to be similar to those already experienced in NSLP operation. FNS will continue to explore cost impacts.
The evaluation of the Nutrient Standard Menu Planning Demonstration will examine the reported costs of school food
service operations associated with implementing NSMP. This evaluation will examine total meal production costs
and will analyze separate components (food, labor, other costs).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By definition, the average results reported above mean that some school districts would be expected to experience
food costs for the sample menus that vary considerably from those reported above. This is not different from the current
situation because there is already a wide range of food costs due to factors such as economies of size, geographic variation
in delivery and labor costs, and local market conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Market Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To estimate market effects a mathematical model was developed to incorporate information on the kinds, amounts,
nutrient content, and costs of foods served in schools lunches. The model uses all of this information and seeks a solution
which minimizes the changes in current amounts of foods served in NSLP meals and also meets the nutrition objectives
set forth in the Dietary Guidelines and adds no additional costs to food purchases. The model constrains food offerings
and recipes to those actually used in schools. However, the meal pattern is allowed to deviate from the current regulations
regarding food groups and portion sizes as long as it meets at least one-third the RDA for all nutrients. In keeping
with the principles of the Dietary Guidelines, the meals are also restricted to no more than 30 percent of calories
from total fat and less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The model can be specified to allow the amounts of all foods to vary, which permits substitution between high and low-fat
beef as well as across other food groups such as pork, poultry, vegetables, and fruits. There are a vast number of possible
scenarios which can be explored through this model, and the three discussed below have been selected as most useful
in understanding the impacts of the proposed rule. In several of these scenarios the model is constrained to maintain
the amounts or types of foods. In all three scenarios the volume of beverage milk is held constant at current consumption
levels. This was done because milk will remain a required item under the proposed nutrition based menu planning system.
The model minimizes the changes in the quantity of each item served and satisfies the nutrition and cost goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The model includes the following constraints for all scenarios: Food ingredient cost at average cost for NSLP meals;
calories (1/3 of average energy allowance listed in the RDA report); total fat (not more than 30 percent of calories);
saturated fat (less than 10 percent of calories); carbohydrate (not less than 50 percent of calories); cholesterol
(not more than 100 mg); 1/3 of RDA level for the following select nutrients: protein, vitamins (vitamins A, B6, B12
and C, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, folate), and minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc); and
milk (total volume and mix by fat content held constant at current levels). As described in greater detail below, scenario
one is the basic model using these constraints, scenario two constrains all chicken to have the nutrient profile of
low-fat chicken, and scenario three constrains the model to retain current levels for major commodity groups. The
estimated changes in food items are then aggregated to national estimates based on the total number of school lunches
served in FY&hyph;1993. Subsequently, the impact of these changes on agricultural markets are estimated using commodity
market models developed by economists in the Economic Research Service.

Data
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The study is based on the most recently available data on quantity and frequency of foods actually served in NSLP meals,
detailed nutrient content of those foods, estimated food ingredient costs, and Recommended Dietary Allowances
for micronutrients and Dietary Guidelines recommendations for fat and saturated fat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on actual foods served in the NSLP were obtained from the 1993 USDA School Nutrition Dietary Assessment (SNDA)
study conducted by Mathematica Policy Research for FNS. The study included a survey of about 3550 students in grades
1 through 12 in 545 schools throughout the country. The students reported detailed information on the kinds and amounts
of foods and beverages they consumed during a 24-hour period. The impact analysis uses only the portion of the data
on foods served to children as part of credited school lunches. It includes plate waste but excluded a la carte items,
such as desserts, purchased in addition to the school lunch. The SNDA survey contained detailed information on over
600 food items served in the school lunch program. These items were aggregated into over 50 food groups based on the
primary ingredient and the percent of calories from fat. For example, there were two beef categories: high-fat and
low-fat beef; two poultry categories; etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food items costs are estimated from ingredient cost data obtained in the 1993 School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study
conducted by Abt for FNS and recipes for school lunch items. The recipes were necessary for two reasons: Aggregation
of ingredient costs to costs of food served, and for estimating the change in usage of the various agricultural commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the agricultural economy, the amount of most foods served in NSLP meals is a small part of the total U.S.
supply of agricultural commodities. For example, USDA and school district purchases of beef products account for
less than two percent of the U. S. beef supply. Therefore, even the anticipated changes in the amounts of different
foods served in the meals are expected to have minimal or no change in farm level prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three alternative scenarios were examined to gauge market effects with alternative specific recommendations which
could be implemented into the meals. All three scenarios meet dietary recommendations and the milk requirement with
no change from the current per meal average food cost. Table 1 shows the total U.S. market in millions of pounds for various
groups of commodities and the corresponding current school market size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three scenarios illustrate a range of market effects that could occur under alternative implementation assumptions.
The first and third options demonstrate the range of market impacts associated with either minimizing the change
in current food offerings or minimizing the change in commodity markets. The second scenario was designed to show
how the results could change if lower fat preparation techniques were followed in only one of the commodity groups.
Although chicken is used in this example, other commodities, such as beef or pork, might show similar changes if substitutions
were made between high and low fat alternatives. Additional information on the constraints on the model imposed in
each of the three scenarios is described in more detail below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three scenarios estimate impacts using current market prices for foods available and in use by schools. To the
extent that products are reformulated to provide additional lower-fat products or lower-fat products become more
widely available and affordable, the market impacts would change. The scenarios do not assume any product innovations.
Similarly, food preparation techniques will play an important role in how the proposal would be implemented. Using
lower fat preparation techniques would enable schools to continue to use foods at current levels because fat added
during preparation would be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No single set of assumptions can adequately describe impacts under the proposed regulation. Schools have tremendous
flexibility under nutrient standard menu planning to meet the dietary guidelines using the methods most appropriate
to their circumstances. Schools can alter the mix of foods served within and among commodity groups. Changes in food
preparation techniques could produce significant improvements in the nutritional profile of meals without any
changes in the types of foods served. The model and the three scenarios examined show that changes in food preparation
techniques for one commodity group can alter the results for other commodity groups. This occurs because the nutrient
and cost targets are fixed. Nutritional improvement for one commodity group, such as a reduction in fat, both leaves
more flexibility for other commodity groups to provide that food component within the established target, and, in
the case of reduction of fat, required additional calories from some source to meet the calorie target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first scenario, ``Minimum change in current offerings'', established the amounts of foods from each of 52 groups
required to meet the dietary, cost, and milk requirements with as little deviation as possible from the current eating
choices of the children. It also required the consumption of low-fat, medium-fat and whole milk to stay at the same
levels as current consumption. The 52 groups include separate groups for high and low fat versions of food items and
dishes. This scenario allows for substitutions among these and other groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second scenario, using poultry as the example, shows how the results change if lower fat preparation techniques
were used in one food category while holding food preparation techniques in other categories constant. High-fat
poultry preparation techniques (such as chicken nuggets) were entirely replaced with lower fat techniques (such
as baked or broiled chicken parts). As noted previously, other commodities might show similar changes if substitutions
were made between high and low fat alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the third scenario, the analysis model was modified to present a ``No change in commodity markets'' scenario where
food commodity groups were restricted to their current level of use in the NSLP (with the exception of butter). The
consumption of the various foods served were allowed to fluctuate within the commodity groups. For example, beef
could be consumed alone or in a mixture such as lasagna, but the total level of beef served was required to be the same
as is currently being served. In general, this adaptation required that low-fat foods be chosen within food groups.
Notable exceptions included serving high-fat chicken and potatoes, probably due to the need to obtain sufficient
calories. Also, the cost became more of a constraining factor in this scenario. Many of the higher fat or costly foods
were eliminated from the solution. Some of the changes included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Serving milk containing less than 17 percent of kilocalories from fat (skim and one-percent); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Serving beef in mixtures such as chili rather than as roasts, steaks, or hamburger patties; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Serving low-fat pork products such as ham instead of ribs or bacon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Serving more meal mixtures such as chili and fewer grain mixtures such as pizza; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Serving more fruits and less fruit juices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This analysis shows that the impact of the school lunch proposed rule on the major commodity markets and related farm
programs would be minimal. Commodity prices, producer marketings and receipts, and farm program outlays under any
of the scenarios would not vary significantly from the levels projected in the USDA 10-year Baseline Projections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule's limited impact reflects several factors including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The share of commodities used in the school lunch program is typically quite small compared to total U.S. disappearance.
Hence changes in school lunch offerings have to be very large before they affect the commercial market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For the first scenario, changes in school lunch menus were designed both to meet the nutritional guidelines
and to minimize changes in children's food choices. While this was done to reflect children's taste/preference,
it has a moderating effect on changes in the commodity composition of school lunches as well as a minimum change in food
service offerings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The second and third scenarios demonstrate that there is considerable potential for substitutions within
food groups (e.g., shifting from conventional to healthier products in the same food group) and for changing food
preparation techniques to improve nutritional value (e.g., shifting from fried to roasted chicken). The modified
menus took advantage of these options. Changes in food preparation techniques and use of healthier products in the
same food group would minimize agricultural impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual commodity market impacts of scenarios one and two are described in greater detail below. These should
be interpreted with the understanding that scenario three shows that it is possible to achieve the dietary, food cost
and milk requirements with no change in commodity markets other than butter. The information presented reflects
estimates of market impacts under full implementation of the proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Dairy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impacts of the proposed rule differ across the fluid milk, butter, and cheese components of the dairy sector. The
modified menus hold milk offerings constant but reduce cheese and eliminate butter. Hence, the major impacts would
be in the processed product markets rather than the fluid market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
School lunch use of butter is eliminated in the three scenarios; the modified menus would annually displace 50&hyph;55
million pounds of butter in a 1.0 billion pound U.S. market. The dairy program activity expected under the baseline
projections would keep the impact of this decline on producer prices, incomes, and government farm programs minimal.
Virtually all of the displaced butter is donated by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) from stocks acquired as
part of its price support operations; purchases occur at the levels needed to support manufacturing milk prices at
legislated levels and minimize stock holding. The school lunch volume is small enough compared to total CCC purchases
and other disposal programs that the butter in question would continue to be acquired under the proposed rule but be
donated to other institutions or sold concessionally or donated abroad. Hence, butter impacts would ultimately
be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of the proposed rule on the cheese market could be more pronounced but still limited. This is because the
volume differences in the use of cheese between the baseline and the scenarios one and two is larger and most of the cheese
used in the school lunch program is bought on the open market rather than donated from CCC stocks. But the annual 80&hyph;90
million pound decline in cheese disappearance associated with these scenarios would account for less than a 1 percent
drop in U.S. cheese disappearance. This would lower farm milk prices 7 to 8 cents per hundredweight causing a decline
in production and lower farm revenues from milk by $150-$200 million annually (from a 1990&hyph;93 base of $19.5 billion).
CCC dairy program costs would increase by an estimated $20 to $25 million annually. Hence, even for cheese, the impacts
on the dairy sector and the budget would be relatively small. As scenario two demonstrates for chicken, a more pronounced
shift towards use of lower fat cheese or other lower fat items in schools could further moderate these impacts. Under
scenario 3 there would be no reduction in cheese.

Meat Sector Impacts: Broilers and Turkeys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of the proposed school lunch rule on the broiler market is expected to be modest under the first and second
scenarios. Broiler offerings in the school lunch program would decline 120 million pounds under the first scenario
and increase 38 million pounds under the second. The current school lunch use of 245 million pounds is a small share
of the total U.S. market of 19.9 billion pounds. Hence, a 120 million pound reduction would lower broiler prices 1.8
percent and reduce farm revenues by 1.2 percent. The second scenario uses chicken as an example of how a large shift
towards low-fat preparation (e.g., from fried to broiled) could moderate shifts in commodity usage. If purchases
are increased by 38 million pounds as provided for under the second scenario, broiler prices would increase 0.4 percent
and revenues rise by 0.2 percent. There are no direct government programs for the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of the proposed rule on the turkey market is expected to be modest under scenarios 1 and 2. Total use of turkey
meat would decline 52 million pounds under one scenario and increase 16 million pounds under the other. The current
school lunch use of 105 million pounds is a small share of the total U.S. market of 4.6 billion pounds. Hence, turkey
prices would decrease 2 percent under the first scenario and increase 0.5 percent under the second. Producer revenues
decrease by $36 million under the first scenario and increase $4 million under the second scenario_less than 0.01
percent in either case. There are no direct government programs for the turkey industry. Again, under scenario 3 there
would be no change in either broilers or turkey.

Meat Sector Impacts: Beef and Pork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of the proposed rule on the beef market is expected to be minimal under the first and second scenarios. School
lunch offerings of beef would decline 100&hyph;126 million pounds from 485 million pounds currently, in a total U.S.
market of 24 billion pounds. This school lunch decline would reduce the farm level market price for beef by less than
1 percent and result in a 0.5 percent reduction in beef producers' revenues. A slightly larger reduction (126 million
pounds) in beef offerings under the second scenario would result in approximately the same reduction in wholesale
beef prices and farm revenues. There are no direct government programs related to the beef industry; hence, the changes
likely under the proposed rule have no direct federal budget implications. As scenario two demonstrates for chicken,
a more pronounced shift towards the use of lower-fat beef, lower-fat beef preparation, or other lower-fat items in
schools could further moderate impacts. Under scenario 3 there would be no impact at all.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of the proposed school lunch rule on the pork market is also expected to be minimal under the first and second
scenarios. This is because much of the pork already in use in the school lunch program is lean pork such as ham. Total
use of pork in the school lunch program would increase 16 million pounds or remain the same in the first and second scenarios.
The school lunch program's current use of 280 million pounds represents a small fraction of the total U.S. market of
17.3 billion pounds. Hence, the 16 million pound increase would boost prices a minimal 0.2 percent. Farm revenues
would increase $11 million or 0.1 percent of their existing revenues. There are no government support programs directly
associated with the pork industry and hence no budget implications.

Fruit, Vegetable, and Potato Market Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impacts of the proposed rule on the fruit, vegetable, and potato markets would be small under the first and second
scenarios. Schools use these products in a variety of forms, including fresh, frozen, canned, and as components of
commercially processed mixtures. Total usage of fruits in the school lunch program would increase 718 million pounds
under the first scenario and over 1.1 billion pounds under the second. Both represent less than 2 percent of the 61.1
billion pound U.S. fruit market. Under scenario one, prices would increase 0.1 percent and farm revenues increase
1.2 percent or $124 million in a $10.2 billion market. Impacts under the second scenario are slightly larger, with
prices up 0.2 percent and revenues up $200 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of vegetables in the program would increase 89 million pounds under the first scenario and 35 million pounds under
the second in a 71 billion pound U.S. market. Under the first and second scenarios, price increases would be negligible
and farm revenue gains would be $5&hyph;12 million or less than 0.1 percent of industry revenues. Use of potatoes in
the program would decline 298 million pounds under the first and second scenarios in response to fewer french fry offerings.
These reductions are expected to have a little or no impact on the 34 billion pound U.S. potato market. Reduced potato
usage would result in 0.1 percent decline in potato prices and a comparable $20 million reduction in farm revenues.
The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study found that potatoes are often fried or prepared with a significant
amount of added fat. The sample menus developed for the food cost analysis show that lower-fat potato dishes can be
readily used under nutrient standard menu planning. As with chicken in scenario two, a more pronounced shift towards
use of lower-fat potato preparation or other lower-fat items by schools could further moderate the impacts on the
potato market.

Field Crop Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The major impact of the proposed rule on the field crop markets would be in the wheat market. Menu changes would increase
the wheat used in various forms in the school lunch program from 16.5 million bushels currently to 28&hyph;30 million
bushels, under the first two scenarios, in a total U.S. market of 2.5 billion bushels. While the difference between
scenarios is insignificant, an increase in wheat demand of 10 to 15 million bushels could spark a small adjustment
in the market. After offsetting changes in production, feed use and exports are taken into account, the net increase
in total use would be roughly 5 million bushels and generate a 2 cent per bushel higher farm price. This would reduce
deficiency payments by about $35 million (from a 1990&hyph;93 base of $1.9 billion) and would increase farmers' market
receipts by about $45 million (from a 1990&hyph;93 base of $7.3 billion), more than offsetting the lost deficiency
payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rice use would increase roughly 1 million hundred weight under the first and second scenarios in a national market
of 180 million hundred weight. This would generate less than a 1 percent change in the farm price of rice, a $7&hyph;9
million increase in market revenues, and an offsetting $6&hyph;8 million reduction in government payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule could also reduce use of oilseeds and related products. Changes in menu items as well as preparation
techniques would decrease use of vegetable oils for frying and salad dressings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But the decreases would be too small to measurably affect prices; moreover, with government support for oilseeds
limited to a loan program with rates set well below forecast market prices, there would be no budget implications.

Peanut Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the agricultural impact models developed for this analysis, peanuts are part of a group including legumes and nuts.
This group shows some increases under the first and second scenarios, although the direct impact on peanuts is less
clear. Even if the findings for the group as a whole are assumed to similarly impact peanuts, the impacts of the proposed
rule on the peanut market would be small under the first and second scenarios. Under the first and second scenarios,
total usage of peanuts in the school lunch program would increase about 6 million pounds from its current school lunch
base of about 44 million pounds. This increase represents less than 0.3 percent of the total U.S. peanut market of 2
billion pounds. Farm prices of peanuts are expected to rise about 0.1 percent and farm revenues increase about $1.0
million. There would be no impact on the government cost of the peanut program.

The three scenarios illustrate that minimizing the change in current offerings creates market impacts that would
not occur if lower-fat substitutions are offered or the mix of commodities within category is allowed to change. They
also emphasize that school menus would have to change in order to avoid any impacts in the commodity market.

USDA Commodities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
USDA for a number of years has made adjustments to improve the nutritional content of commodities provided, however,
the basic types and quantities of foods offered to schools have not changed significantly. The analysis conducted
indicates that schools can provide meals that meet the dietary guidelines without significant changes in the types
of food provided and the Department can continue to make improvements to the commodities provided without diminishing
agricultural market support to farmers. In total, USDA commodities account for less than one-sixth of all foods used
by schools; the overall average is 16.4 percent. Although there is some variation among schools in the amount of USDA
commodities they receive, USDA commodities make up between 10 and 25 percent of the food used for the vast majority
(96 percent) of the school food authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market analysis for scenario one and the sample menus developed for the NSMP food cost analysis reflect an expected
shift toward increased use of vegetables, fruits and grains. Such a shift is consistent with the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans and the Food Guide Pyramid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This shift can occur without causing significant impacts in overall food markets, however, or in the amounts and types
of food USDA provides to schools, with the exception of butter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA continues to make improvements that reduce the proportion of calories from fat in donated commodities: Reducing
fat levels in ground beef; acquiring lower-fat cheeses and salad dressings; and providing foods in lower-fat forms
(chicken vs. chicken nuggets). Because USDA provides a significant proportion of a small number of foods schools
use (cheese_45 percent; beef_30 percent; turkey_70 percent; chicken_29 percent) efforts to lower the percentage
of calories from fat for these commodities can have a substantial impact on the overall nutrient profile of foods used
in the program. Even if there are some shifts in the types of foods that schools serve, there is likely to be little change
in the overall amount of USDA acquisitions of cheese, beef and poultry because the Department's purchasing power
would provide the best leverage for securing lower-fat versions of these products at the lowest price.

No near-term cost savings due to health improvement from the nutritional update are projected. However, longer term
savings in health care costs and years of life may result. The Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals, 1989&hyph;91
found that school-age children have average daily intakes of 33.7 to 34.7 percent of calories from fat, and 12.6 to
13.3 percent of calories from saturated fat, depending upon the age-sex group. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans
recommends limiting total fat intake to not more than 30 percent of total calories, and limiting saturated fat intake
to less than 10 percent of total calories. The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (SNDA) found the average
daily consumption by NSLP participants on school days to be 35 percent of calories from fat and 13 percent of calories
from saturated fat, compared to 33 percent of calories from fat and 12 percent of calories from saturated fat for non-participants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SNDA also found that students consume fat and saturated fat from school meals at about the same levels as those offered
to them. SNDA found schools offering NSLP meals which averaged 38 percent of calories from fat and 15 percent of calories
from saturated fat, and participants consumed NSLP meals with 37 percent of calories from fat and 14 percent of calories
from saturated fat. Implementation of the proposed rule would reduce the fat levels at school meals to the Dietary
Guidelines levels. Using these figures along with the average percent of school-age children receiving a USDA meal
(51%) and the average number of school days per year (182), we estimate that, on average, the proposed rule will achieve
about 12 percent of the change needed to reach the Dietary Guidelines levels for percent of calories from fat and saturated
fat for all U.S. children ages 5 to 18 years. Since school meal participation rates are higher for low-income children
than for higher income children, the health benefits will be concentrated in the population at greatest risk of nutrition-related
chronic diseases_those with low income. Healthy People 2000: The National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
Objectives reports that low income is a special risk factor for both heart disease and cancer.

The long term savings in health care costs and increase in years of life could result to the extent that lower intakes
of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, and increased intakes of grains, fruits and low-fat vegetables either
throughout the school years or over a more extended period of time could reduce the risk of diet-related chronic diseases
such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and atherosclerosis. These diseases accounted for almost 65 percent of all
deaths in the U.S. in 1991.

The savings in years of life and the value associated with a population reduction of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol
has been estimated for the U.S. adult population. These estimates were incorporated into the regulatory impact analysis
for the food labeling regulatory proposal published on November 27, 1991, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

 While no comparable estimates are currently available for dietary changes by school-age children, it is useful to
consider the magnitude of effects expected from the proposed changes in the school meal programs with that projected
for food labeling.

RTI and FDA then used the changes for men and women in a computer model developed by Dr. Warren Browner to estimate the
effects on years of life over a period of 20 years. The increased years of life estimates were then used to estimate a
value for the added years of life. These changes were found to result in an estimated 20-year reduction of 35,179 cases
of cancer, and a reduction of 4,028 cases of coronary heart disease. As a result they estimated avoiding 12,902 deaths
and increasing life-years by 80,930.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA used two different approaches to estimating the total value of the food labeling changes, a remaining years of
life approach and a mean value approach (see November 27, 1991

, pages 60871&hyph;0872, for a more detailed description). They also estimated totals using two different dollar
values for consumer willingness to pay for risk reduction_a conservative estimate of $1.5 million and a higher estimate
of $3.0 million. The value of the benefits from increased life-years was estimated to be $3.6 billion (discounted
at 5 percent over a 20 year period). When benefits were valued based upon the number of early deaths prevented and the
higher willingness to pay figure of $3.0 million, the estimate (similarly discounted) increased to $21 billion.
In January 6, 1993, when publishing the final food labeling rule with a comment analysis, FDA updated their 20-year
value estimates to between $4.4 billion and $26.5 billion.

USDA agrees with FDA that for government policy evaluation, society's willingness to pay for risk reduction is an
appropriate concept to use in evaluating the impact of government actions which will reduce risks. The FDA estimates
of $1.5 million and $3.0 million used in their analysis are quite conservative. Economists have three decades of experience
in estimating the value of reducing the risk of fatalities using labor market data. Fisher, Chestnut and Violette
(1989) evaluated the merits of these studies of the extra wages that would have to be paid for accepting a higher risk
of fatality on the job; concluded that the results from the studies without obvious design flaws were reasonable consistent;
and reported that the studies implied a value-per-statistical-life of $1.6 million to $8.5 million (in 1986 dollars).

 This range of value-per-statistical-life becomes $2 million to $10.4 million in 1993 dollars (updated using the
change in Bureau of Labor Statistics' average weekly earnings paid to nonagriculture nonsupervisory workers).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Viscusi (1993) also surveyed risks of death and concluded that ``the most reasonable estimates of the value of life
are clustered in the $3 million to $7 million range'' (p. 1942). However, he cautions that these estimates may be low,
because the populations of exposed workers in these studies generally have lower incomes than individuals being
protected by government risk regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (The positive income elasticity for risk reduction means that higher values for lifesaving should be used when evaluating
many risk reduction programs, such as airline safety programs). Fisher, Chestnut, and Violette also caution that
to the individual's valuation of the risk reduction should be added the value loved ones and altruistic others also
would be ``willing to pay for reducing the fatality risk for those exposed to it'' (p. 97). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values for risk reduction may be greater when risks are involuntarily assumed than when the risks are voluntarily
chosen. This is relevant to the school lunch situation where a limited array of choices are offered in the lunch program.
Thus, the higher estimates may be most appropriate for evaluating the school lunch programs' healthier diet and its
contribution to reducing risk per-statistical-life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison to the dietary changes predicted by FDA for food labeling, the improvements in fat and saturated fat
estimated for the school meal program proposed regulation are substantial. The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment
Study found that dietary intake from NSLP lunches provides 37 percent of calories from fat and 14 percent of calories
from saturated fat. Reducing these lunchtime intakes to the Dietary Guidelines levels proposed in the regulation
would reduce an NSLP participant's intake by 5.9 grams of fat and 3.4 grams of saturated fat on each day school lunch
is eaten. Allowing for 182 school days per year and the percent of total U.S. children age 5 through 18 years who receive
a meal on any school day (51%), it is estimated that the average daily reduction across all school-aged youth would
be 1.5 grams fat and 0.86 grams saturated fat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates are significantly above those estimated for the FDA food labeling changes for fat and saturated fat.
For cholesterol, school meals already provide a moderate intake and no further reduction will be required by the proposed
regulation. To further compare the aggregate effect to that estimated for the food labeling regulations, consider
the situation where the adult population reduces fat by 1.5 grams, reduces saturated fat by 0.86 grams, and does not
reduce dietary cholesterol intake. This is necessary because there are no commonly accepted equations to relate
changes in children's intakes of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol to chronic disease reduction. The Browner model
assumes that the relative risk of cancer is a function of total fat. The reduction of 1.5 grams of fat is about 39 percent
greater than the reduction of 1.08 grams average for males and females estimated for FDA's food labeling, so a larger
reduction in cancer incidence and deaths would be expected. For coronary heart disease, the Browner model assumes
that all change is mediated through changes in serum cholesterol, which is affected by total fat, the type of fat, and
dietary cholesterol. FDA used the following equation from Hegsted (1986) to estimate the change in serum cholesterol:

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Change in serum cholesterol in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) = 2.16S ^ 1.65P + 0.097C

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
S = change in percentage of total calories represented by saturated fat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P = change in percentage of total calories represented by polyunsaturated fat, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C = change in dietary cholesterol measured in milligrams per 1000 kilocalories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Hegsted equation shows that the greatest effect on serum cholesterol is due to saturated fat, and that changes
in dietary cholesterol only play a small part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NSLP changes result in an average reduction in saturated fat of 0.86 grams, which is 2.77 times the reduction of
0.31 grams estimated for FDA's food labeling. Since the estimated change in polyunsaturated fat levels is only slightly
greater for food labeling than for the proposed regulation, the overall estimated change in serum cholesterol for
the adult example based upon changes at the levels which are proposed for school lunch would be considerably greater
than that projected for labeling, driven by the large decline in saturated fat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, if the reductions in fat and saturated fat intake instituted during the school years are continued into
adulthood, the increase in life-years and the value in dollars based upon willingness to pay would be of a magnitude
similar to or exceeding that estimated for the food labeling changes, which were $4.4 to $26.5 billion over 20 years.
However, the lag time to realize this level of benefits over a 20 year period might be greater since FDA's estimates
apply to the U.S. adult population and the proposed rule on school meals will begin to have effect with those children
in school at the time of implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fat and saturated fat reductions estimated to accompany the proposed regulation assume that: (1) Students do
not replace school meal fat and saturated fat reductions by increasing fat intake at other times of the day or on non-school
days, (2) that the dietary improvements at USDA school meals do not result in similar improvements at other meals or
on non-school days and (3) that the improvements by program participants do not result in changes by non-program participants.
If students did replace fat and saturated fat at other eating occasions, a smaller health benefit would result. If
improvements on school days serve as a positive models which, when combined with nutrition education, result in improvements
to non-USDA school meal, a larger improvement would result. The findings from the Menu Modification Demonstrations
indicate that the daily fat intakes of NSLP participants would decline if their fat intakes at lunch were lower, but
the effect on non-school meals is less clear.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four sites at geographically dispersed locations (Chattanooga, TN; Denver, CO; Princeton City, OH; and San Bernadino,
CA) received grants to test reduction in the fat content of NSLP meals. Dietary intakes of fifth grade NSLP participants
at lunch and over 24 hours were collected both at baseline and after the reduction of fat in the NSLP meals. The demonstration
found that the percent of calories from fat over 24 hours declined either significantly or marginally at all sites
for both boys and girls. In addition, the reduction of intake in grams of total fat over 24 hours was greater than or equal
to the reduction at the NSLP meal at three of the four sites. At the fourth site (Princeton City), despite an NSLP reduction
in fat, 24-hour calories and grams of fat increased. At the San Bernardino site, which achieved the largest reduction
in fat at the NSLP meals, the reduction of grams of fat over 24 hours was significantly greater than the NSLP reduction.
On balance, the results of this demonstration indicate that when fat at the NSLP meal is reduced, students usually
do not replace these calories by increasing fat intake at other eating occasions. While there is some indication that
an accompanying reduction in fat at other eating occasions may be more common than an increase in fat at other eating
occasions, findings are mixed and therefore not robust enough to influence benefit projections. Accordingly, the
analysis in this section assumes that changes in NSLP fat levels do not affect fat intake at other occasions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fat and saturated fat reductions discussed in the impact analysis above relate only to the lunch meal. The proposed
regulation will also reduce fat and saturated fat in school breakfasts, from 28 to 25 percent of total calories from
fat, and from 11 to 10 percent of total calories from saturated fat. This will increase the overall reduction in average
fat and saturated fat for the student population, but to a lesser extent than NSLP due to the smaller reductions and
because fewer students participate in the School Breakfast Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The food labeling regulations are not expected to reduce U.S. fat and saturated fat levels by the full amount needed
to achieve the Dietary Guidelines. This indicates that there will be room for the fat and saturated fat reductions
which would result from the proposed rule to generate health improvement.

d. Effects on Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is anticipated that the rule will have minimal effect on NSLP participation because implementation of the rule
is not expected to increase meal prices or decrease meal acceptability. On a typical day, 25 million children participate
in the National School Lunch Program. About 14 million of these meals are served to children receiving free or reduced
price lunches. USDA has analyzed both the impact of meeting the dietary guidelines on meal price and meal acceptability
and the implications for program participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lunch price is an important factor in determining the level of participation among these students, with students
participating at higher rates in schools with lower prices. Research indicates that price increases can cause substantial
decreases in student participation. A key factor in maintaining participation among paid students while implementing
the dietary guidelines is minimizing the meal cost. Food cost analysis demonstrated that nutritional targets can
be reached within current food cost constraints. Minimizing cost impacts removes upward pressure on student fees
which would result in decreased student participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA's efforts to test the effect of reducing fat and sodium and increasing the nutritional quality of meals has shown
that improvements can be made without affecting participation. Although the SNDA study found that schools that served
meals with a low proportion of calories from fat (less than 32 percent) had lower than average program participation,
this information needs to be viewed in the larger context of efforts specifically designed to examine improvements
in school meals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department sponsored demonstration projects in five school food authorities from school year 1989&hyph;90
to 1991&hyph;92 to evaluate the extent to which menus planned to meet the NSLP meal pattern could be modified to better
reflect the dietary guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Through the Menu Modification Demonstration Project, USDA examined the process involved in modifying school meals,
including the impact on program participation. The demonstration found that fat could be decreased significantly
without decreasing program participation. The percentage decrease in grams of fat ranged from 12 to 31 percent in
the four sites. In all schools, average daily participation remained stable or increased slightly. In addition,
the improvements were made with relatively minor changes in the types of foods offered. Although the districts were
not able to make comparable improvements in the percentage of calories from fat, because overall calories decreased,
the results demonstrate that fat can be cut without losing participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California is operating a State-wide demonstration of nutrient standard menu planning. The State reported that
the nutrient-based system they implemented did not result in any decreases in gross meal participation between 1990
and 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNDA did find lower student participation in very low-fat schools, however, the study also indicated that it is possible
to reduce the average fat content of lunches offered to well below the national average of 38 percent of food energy
without adversely affecting participation in the NSLP. Participation rates were similar in schools whose lunches
provide a moderate percentage of food energy from fat (32 percent to 35 percent) and in those whose meals provide a high
or very high percentage of food energy from fat. It is important to note that the SNDA finding of low participation among
low-fat schools is not based on experience with schools altering the nutrient content of food but rather on a point-in-time
cross-sectional observation of schools with low-fat meals. The study did not collect information on how the schools
implemented low-fat meals and what consequences these would have had on participation.

USDA recognizes that significant efforts must be undertaken to ensure that participation is maintained as meals
are improved. If a meal does not taste good or look good then children will not eat it. The proposed regulation recognizes
that food changes alone will not bring schools meals in line with the dietary guidelines. The results of SNDA and the
two demonstrations suggest that reductions in calories from fat must be accompanied by nutrition education and promotional
activities to maintain student participation. Gradual implementation of the Dietary Guidelines in school meals
will allow for incremental changes in food offerings, minimizing the impact on current participation in the school
meal programs. School food service is a nonprofit business that must meet student preferences to stay viable. This
requires maintenance of participation by meeting food preferences, and accomplishing nutritional improvements
through changes to recipes, food preparation techniques and purchasing specifications that are consistent with
these preferences.

e. Implementation Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Initial implementation costs faced by schools will vary depending on existing capabilities and resources within
districts and will take many forms. Local, State and Federal resources are available for implementation. USDA has
already initiated a number of improvements: Updated and improved recipes for schools, a computerized data bank of
standard nutritional values of meals served and a demonstration project on NSMP. The demonstration will incur much
of the developmental cost of the basic system framework and identify cost effective strategies for implementation.
The Department has announced the availability of nutrition education cooperative agreements to develop comprehensive
community-based approaches to nutrition education and is working on a national publication directed at grade school
children. The Department is assisting school food service professionals in working with chefs, farmers and others
to make school meals appealing and healthful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The President's FY 1995 budget contains a request of over $20 million to support extensive training for school meal
providers on how to plan and prepare nutritious and appealing meals as well as launching a national media campaign
directed at building children's skills at making wise food choices for life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States receive over $90 million annually from the Federal level in State Administrative Expense (SAE) funds for program
oversight. A portion of these resources are available to assist in implementation. In addition, the proposed regulation
would reduce the level of State resources devoted to local school food authority reviews, which is described in more
detail below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the local level, implementing nutrient standard menu planning will require computer capabilities. Many schools
currently make extensive use of computers for management activities and have the facilities and capabilities to
undertake nutrient standard menu planning. One of the goals of the initiative is to use the technology more effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study of school food authorities in the mid-Atlantic region found that 60 percent of SFAs employ computers for some
functions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Over one-fourth of these districts had comprehensive systems that allowed them to do menu management and nutritional
evaluations. The menu modification demonstrations found that the lack of appropriate computer software limited
the feasibility of monitoring the nutritional quality of menus. More recently developed software has greatly enhanced
the ability to perform these analyses, which will now be supported by a USDA developed data base. Schools with microcomputers
should be able to use this software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schools without sufficient computer capability or necessary access to technical assistance may opt for Assisted
Nutrient Standard Menu Planning, which will allow development and analysis of menus by other entities, such as State
agencies, consortiums of school districts, consultants or the Federal government, while still applying the essentials
of NSMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per meal reimbursement provided to schools was designed to cover both the food and administrative costs (labor
and operations) of providing meals to students and can be used to acquire computer hardware and software. Enhanced
computing abilities offer significant improvements in other areas of food service management beyond nutrient standard
menu planning. The potential for additional improvements in food service operations beyond menu planning, for example,
inventory control, should help offset the cost of acquiring this capability for NSMP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cost analysis found that the nutrient requirements of NSMP can be met at about the current cost of food in the National
School Lunch Program. Because the foods used in the sample menus were drawn from what is currently being served, USDA
does not anticipate the need for significant changes in meal preparation practices that would affect the cost to prepare
meals. The administrative cost of conducting NSMP should be about the same as current operations once the system is
fully implemented in a school. An evaluation of costs in the California nutrient standard demonstration reported
that most schools experienced slight cost changes that ranged from 4 percent savings to 1.5 percent increased costs
and concluded that most districts can expect to experience very little change in overall food service costs when implementing
a nutrient-based system.

f. Other Significant Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Nutrition Service believes that implementation of nutrient-based menus will require extensive training
and technical assistance, especially at the school food authority level. In addition, the acquisition of computers
(for schools that do not already have them) or contracting for computer or assistance with the revised menu planning
system may involve some local level expenditures during the implementation period. While implementation will require
a dedicated effort on the part of our agency, the state agencies and local school food authorities, the ongoing operation
and maintenance of nutrient-based menu planning will be indistinguishable from the current meal pattern based system
in terms of efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for the resources needed for implementation, the regulation proposes a twenty per cent reduction in state
monitoring requirements. This reduction will enhance the level of resources available to focus on training and technical
assistance efforts. Many school food authorities will no longer have the requirement for specific edit checks to
review claims submitted for reimbursable meals. Rather, these school food authorities will have flexibility to
develop their own internal controls for such review. This provision is largely intended to streamline program administration,
but will also provide some relief from program management burdens.

Other Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation proposes to streamline some existing administrative procedures of State agencies and school districts.
This will permit States and school districts to implement NSMP and focus on the nutritional needs of children. At the
State level the school food authority review cycle will be extended from four to five years, reducing by 20 percent
the resources devoted to this effort. While this will extend the time period between formal reviews, most districts
are currently visited more frequently than the current four year cycle. The States will continue to have a significant
presence at the local level. Although the focus of attention will be on implementing NSMP there should be no perceived
reduction in State oversight.

Reason for Selection of Proposed Alternative: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overriding purpose behind this rule is to serve more nutritious and healthful meals to school children while maintaining
access to the meal programs for needy children and enhancing the flexibility of local schools to administer the programs.

 and Recommended Dietary Allowances. They are based upon the recommendations of an expert committee, the Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee, specifically appointed to assist in developing Dietary Guidelines for use across
Federal government. There are no alternative policy documents with official sanction by the government departments
responsible for domestic nutrition which could provide alternative dietary targets for the general population.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs published a Proposed Rule which amends 25 CFR part 256, Housing Improvement
Program (59 FR 16726). The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposes a revision to the distribution method for Housing
Improvement Program (HIP) funds from a housing inventory basis to documented eligible applicants. Based on the total
number of eligible applicants submitted by all tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will distribute FY 1995
HIP funds proportionally and transfer these funds into the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each tribe. Beginning in FY 1996, individual tribes will make their own determination of funding levels for HIP within
their TPA funding allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A technical correction is also made to eliminate Category C, Downpayments which are inconsistent with the intent
of the HIP. The income levels in the January 1992 issue of 25 CFR 256 were established to ensure that the program served
truly needy individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revision is proposed to eliminate individuals who own a home acquired under Federal housing assistance from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through an Indian Housing Authority from being served under HIP.
They would not meet the eligibility requirements of HIP since they have already been served by a Federal program. Comments
and requests received from Indian people indicate that additional time is needed for the public comment period to
facilitate adequate and proper review of the Proposed Rule. All comments received during the initial and extended
comment period will be given full consideration. We believe that the extended public comment period will provide
an adequate opportunity for tribes and tribal organizations to provide comment and input into the final rule.
