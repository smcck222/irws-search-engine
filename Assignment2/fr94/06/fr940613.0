SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires repetitive inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary.
This amendment is prompted by the results of extensive pressure fatigue tests conducted by the manufacturer. The
actions specified by this AD are intended to detect and repair fatigue cracking in certain lap joints, which will ensure
safe operation of airplanes that have exceeded their economic design goal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 17, 1993 (58 FR 65943). That action proposed to require repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC)
inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2367, dated January 27, 1994,
be included as an additional source of service information. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance of the proposal, the
FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2367, dated January 27, 1994,
which clarifies the procedures for accomplishment of the inspections described in the Initial Release of the service
bulletin, dated December 18, 1991 (which was referenced in the proposal as the sole source of appropriate service
information). Therefore, paragraphs (a) and (c) of the final rule have been revised to reference Revision 1 of the
service bulletin as an additional source of service information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a reporting requirement to keep Boeing and
the FAA advised of findings of cracks. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that the unsafe condition addressed
by this AD (which is to detect and repair fatigue cracking in certain lap joints) will be adequately addressed by paragraph
(a) of the final rule, which requires the inspection of certain lap joints, and paragraph (c) of the final rule, which
requires the repair of all cracks found during the inspection. Therefore, since the final rule requires repetitive
inspections to detect cracks and repair of all findings of cracks, the FAA finds that a reporting requirement would
unduly burden operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further requests that the proposed rule be revised to compensate for operators that fly with cabin
pressure differentials of 2.0 psi or less when calculating the number of flight cycles to determine the compliance
time. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that operating at cabin pressure differentials of 2.0 psi or less is applicable
to only one operator. Since there are numerous factors that affect the calculation of flight cycles, such as total
number of low pressure cycles, amount of thrust, number of gross weight flight cycles, etc., the FAA has determined
that these mitigating factors could be best evaluated through requests for alternative methods of compliance, as
provided for in paragraph (d) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 22,000 flight cycles be extended to 25,000 flight cycles
to inspect the lap joints in areas outside of Stringer 14 since data indicate that cracking in these areas did not occur
until after 25,000 flight cycles. The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this AD,
the FAA not only evaluated the fatigue test data that was provided by the manufacturer, but took into consideration
the size of the test sample: the test results were based upon just one airplane that had no loads and was not pressurized.
Based on this data, the FAA determined that 22,000 flight cycles represented a conservative threshold for initiating
inspections so as to ensure that any cracking initiation would be found in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 3,000 flight cycles to perform the repetitive inspections
be extended to 4,300 flight cycles to coincide with operators' regularly scheduled maintenance periods. The FAA
does not concur. The FAA has determined that the compliance time, as proposed, represents the maximum interval of
time allowable for the affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. In developing this
inspection interval, the FAA evaluated the reliability of the inspection method and the results of fatigue test data.
The FAA found that extending this interval by more than one-third would allow cracks to propagate undetected, which
would adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 723 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910, or $770 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this
action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided
under the caption

stringer number 41; installation of a repair, if necessary; and modification of that stringer. This amendment is
prompted by reports of fatigue cracks in outer wing stringer number 41. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent reduced structural integrity of the wing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49946). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracks in wing stringer
number 41; installation of a repair, if necessary; and modification of that stringer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its members, requests that the FAA include a flow
diagram in the proposal since its provisions are complex. The FAA does not concur. The FAA considers that the requirements
of this AD are presented in a reasonably clear manner in the text of the final rule. In addition, McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10
Service Bulletin 57&hyph;114, Revision 1, dated July 26, 1993, which is referenced in the AD as the appropriate source
of service information, provides corresponding guidance for accomplishment of the actions required by this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA also suggests that, prior to issuance of the final rule, the FAA should verify that the service bulletin will not
create problems for operators, and that accomplishment of the service bulletin should be verified by an operator
before the AD is finalized. One ATA member experienced difficulty accomplishing the permanent repair specified
in the service bulletin because parts listed did not fit, drawings were erroneous, and fastener grip lengths were
inadequate for the repair. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request. The FAA has conveyed these concerns to the
manufacturer, and has verified that the initial problems expressed by the commenter have been corrected in Revision
1 of the service bulletin. Since Revision 1 of the service bulletin was cited in the proposal as the appropriate source
of service information, the FAA finds that no change to the AD is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the FAA allow visual inspection methods to be used in lieu of the proposed eddy current
inspection methods. The commenter indicates that fastener accessibility enables accomplishment of a visual inspection
and provides an equivalent level of crack detection. The FAA does not concur. Based on the results of crack growth analysis,
the FAA has determined that a visual inspection of the stringer cannot provide an acceptable level of crack detection.
In addition, the FAA based the repetitive inspection intervals on the crack growth analysis results based upon the
minimum crack length detectable by eddy current inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also requests that credit be given for general visual inspections accomplished previously. A second
commenter supports the proposed rule, but requests that the AD be revised to state that inspections accomplished
within 1,500 landings prior to the effective date of the AD are acceptable in lieu of the initial inspection. The commenters
provide no justification for these requests. Since the FAA has determined that a visual inspection of the stringer
does not provide an acceptable level of crack detection, as discussed previously, the FAA considers that the requirement
for eddy current inspections is appropriate and credit cannot be extended for general visual inspections accomplished
previously. However, the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' which appears in the ``Compliance'' paragraph
of the final rule, provides credit for operators that have accomplished the required inspection prior to the effective
date of this AD in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 57&hyph;114, Revision 1, dated
July 26, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the first inspection accomplished to comply with this AD be required during the airplane's
next heavy maintenance visit if a general visual inspection has been accomplished prior to the effective date of the
AD. The FAA does not concur. A general visual inspection of the stringer does not provide an acceptable level of crack
detection, as discussed previously. In developing an appropriate initial compliance time for this action, the FAA
considered the safety implications and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the inspection.
In consideration of these items, the FAA has determined that 6,500 total landings or 1,500 landings after the effective
date of the AD, whichever occurs later, represents the maximum interval of time allowable wherein the inspection
can reasonably be accomplished and an acceptable level of safety can be maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter states that the service bulletin cited in the AD specifies that one reason for accomplishing the
actions described in the service bulletin is to prevent unscheduled maintenance downtime for replacement of a cracked
stringer; therefore, the commenter questions the need for this AD. The commenter adds that, to date, stringer 41 cracking
has not impacted its maintenance due to the viable maintenance program currently in place. The commenter states that
imposing an AD at this time would only complicate its maintenance program and would contribute little toward ensuring
that the airplane wing structure is operating in good condition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur. As explained in the preamble of the proposal, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracks
in outer wing stringer number 41 and, in one case, complete failure of the stringer. Such fatigue cracking presents
an unsafe condition in airplanes, since it could eventually lead to failure of the stringer and reduced structural
integrity of the wing. The FAA has determined that this unsafe condition could exist or eventually develop on Model
DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, and that repetitive inspections of the
affected area must be mandated to ensure that safety is not degraded. The appropriate vehicle for mandating such action
to correct an unsafe condition is the airworthiness directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time for accomplishment of the initial inspection specified
in paragraph (b)(1) of the proposal be changed from ``[p]rior to the accumulation of 6,500 total landings, or within
1,500 landings after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later,'' to ``[p]rior to the accumulation of 6,500
total landings, or within one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later.'' The commenter operates
Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;40 series airplanes of non-U.S. registry for training flights for cockpit crews. The commenter
explains that, during one training flight period of a few weeks, the number of flight cycles accumulated may be more
than 1,500 landings. The commenter adds that the proposed inspections and modifications require entry into the fuel
tanks; therefore, the commenter plans to accomplish the initial inspections and the modifications during regularly
scheduled maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Compliance times for AD's are normally based on a parameter related
to failure of a particular component. In this case, fatigue cracking in outer wing stringer number 41 and subsequent
failure of the stringer are undoubtedly related to the number of landings. The FAA has determined, in this case, that
there is no apparent direct relationship between failure of the stringer and calendar time. In light of this, and in
consideration of the average utilization rate of the affected U.S. operators and the practical aspects of orderly
inspections of the U.S. fleet during regular maintenance periods, the FAA established the compliance times specified
in this AD. The FAA maintains that those compliance times are appropriate. However, the FAA would consider a request
for adjustment of the compliance time, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this AD, provided that,
for example, continued operational safety of the airplane could be assured until the required action is accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that, in order for the AD requirements to align with the actions described in the service bulletin,
accomplishment of the preventative modification should be considered optional, and that operators should be permitted
to accomplish repetitive inspections at intervals of 4,000 landings in lieu of the preventative modification. The
FAA does not concur. The degree of assurance necessary as to the adequacy of inspections needed to maintain the safety
of the aging transport airplane fleet, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous
repetitive inspections, has caused the FAA to place less emphasis on repetitive inspections and more emphasis on
design improvements and material replacement. Thus, in lieu of its previous position of continual inspection, and
repair or modification on condition if cracks are found, the FAA has decided to require, whenever practicable, airplane
modifications necessary to remove the source of the particular aging phenomena.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 426 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the
affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 121 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series
airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 13.6 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10
and &hyph;15 series airplanes will cost approximately $586 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes is estimated to be $161,414,
or $1,334 per airplane.

The FAA estimates that 148 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military)
airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 13.6 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30
and &hyph;40 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes will cost approximately $1,420 per airplane.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;40
series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes is estimated to be $320,864, or $2,168 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $482,278. The total cost
impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action,
and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B
series airplanes, that requires an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves, and further inspections and repair,
if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report of delamination between the composite structure and the aluminum
foil on the elevator cove on a Model SAAB SF340B series airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
jamming of the aileron or elevator.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5361). That action proposed to require an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to
verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint or
expanded aluminum foil, that action proposed to require a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to
detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed visual inspections
and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. Accomplishment of the permanent repair
terminates the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 152 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20
work hours per airplane to accomplish the inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $167,200, or $1,000 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this
action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided
under the caption

 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T94&hyph;10&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of certain Airbus Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes by individual telegrams.
This AD requires a detailed visual inspection to detect cracks, delamination, or discoloration of the bus bar of certain
aft fixed side cockpit windows; and deactivation of the window heating system and repetitive detailed visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report
of fracture of a fixed cockpit window that led to electrical arcing in the bus bar area of the window heating system on
a Model A300 series airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent decompression of the fuselage
during flight due to failure of a window.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 3, 1994, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51, which is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie
Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes. That action was prompted by a report of fracture of a fixed cockpit
window on the right-hand aft side of the cockpit of a Model A300 series airplane. Embrittlement of the fixed cockpit
window and simultaneous rupture of the two main plies of the window have been attributed to electrical arcing in the
bus bar area of the window 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in decompression of the fuselage during flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the subject windows installed on Model A300&hyph;600 and A310 series airplanes are similar in design to those
on Model A300 series airplanes, the FAA has determined that these airplanes are also subject to the addressed unsafe
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus Industrie has issued All Operators Telex (AOT) 56&hyph;01, Revision 1, dated April 29, 1994, that describes
procedures for a detailed visual inspection to detect discoloration (black or brown burnt spots) of the bus bar of
certain aft fixed side windows; and either deactivation of the window heating system coupled with repetitive detailed
visual inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for France, classified this AOT as mandatory and issued French telegraphic airworthiness directive N 94&hyph;104&hyph;160(B),
dated April 26, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These airplane models are manufactured in France and are type certificated for operation in the United States under
the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered
in the United States, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51 to require a detailed visual inspection
to detect cracks, delamination, or discoloration (black or brown burnt spots) of the bus bar of certain aft fixed side
windows; and either deactivation of the window heating system and repetitive detailed visual inspections, or replacement
of the window with a modified window, if necessary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on May 3, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of certain Airbus Model A300,
A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an amendment to &sect;39.13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective as to all persons.

Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;63&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage
upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. This amendment also requires modification of certain lap joints and inspections
of modified lap joints. This amendment is prompted by a structural review of Model 747 series airplanes. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to prevent rapid decompression of the airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe
loads, due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking and corrosion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8875). That action proposed to require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks
and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. That action also proposed
to require modification of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that proposed inspection requirements be revised. This commenter requests that, if the visual
inspection [proposed in paragraph (a)(1) of the AD] reveals any evidence of corrosion, operators should be allowed
to perform a low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspection of the entire length of the lap joint to determine if corrosion
exceeds 10% of the skin thickness. If this LFEC inspection is accomplished, the commenter also requests that the visual
inspection repetitive interval specified in paragraph (a)(1) be extended from the proposed 2,000 landings to 3,000
landings so that the interval corresponds with other major structural inspection intervals. The FAA cannot concur
with this request, since the commenter provided neither specific inspection instructions nor data to justify the
effectiveness of the proposed procedures. Under the provisions of paragraph (i) of the final rule, however, operators
may apply for the approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD, or adjustment of the compliance time,
if sufficient justification is presented to the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that proposed paragraph (a) be clarified with regard to the inspections and inspection interval
required after a lap joint has been modified. These commenters request that, for lap joints that have been modified
by either the full or partial modification procedures described in the referenced Boeing service bulletin, operators
be allowed a period of time during which no inspections are required for those lap joints. The referenced Boeing service
bulletin, as well as proposed paragraph (f), state that post-modification inspections are to start at 10,000 cycles,
7,000 cycles, or 5,000 cycles after modification of the skin lap joints, depending upon the type of modification that
has been accomplished. However, as worded in paragraph (a) of the proposal, the same inspections meant to detect cracks
and corrosion in unmodified skin lap joints would be required to be performed on modified skin lap joints until the
inspections specified in proposed paragraph (f) begin. The FAA concurs that clarification of this requirement is
necessary. It was not the FAA's intent to require that the initial-type of inspections of unmodified lap joints be
performed on modified lap joints. Accordingly, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) have been revised to indicate that the
inspections of the specified lap joints are to continue at repetitive intervals only until the lap joints are modified
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the compliance time for accomplishing the ``full'' modification on certain lap
joints, as specified in paragraph (b)(2), be extended from the proposed 15 months to 18 months. Additionally, these
commenters request that the compliance time for a similar requirement specified in paragraph (c)(2) be extended
from the proposed 30 months to 36 months. The commenters state that, by extending these compliance times, operators
would be able to accomplish the modification during a scheduled maintenance interval (``C'' check), and thereby
eliminate the need to schedule special times for the accomplishment of this modification, at additional expense.
The FAA concurs. It was the FAA's intent that the modification be performed at a main base during regularly scheduled
maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Accordingly,
the final rule has been revised to specify compliance times as requested by the commenters. The FAA has determined
that this extension will not adversely affect safety since the affected lap joints will be subject to repetitive inspections
in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that paragraph (e) be revised to extend the compliance time for accomplishment of the ``full''
modification of the specified skin lap joints from the proposed 1,000 cycles (for airplanes that have accumulated
nearly or more than 20,000 total flight cycles) to 4 years after the effective date of the final rule. These commenters
consider the proposed compliance time to be too short and not consistent with compliance times provided for similar
actions in other AD's pertaining to aging aircraft issues. The FAA does not concur. The 1,000 flight cycle compliance
time is consistent with the mandatory modification of a lap joint that has been found to have corrosion or cracking,
as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this AD. Cold bonded lap joints such as these have a history of numerous findings
of fatigue cracks and corrosion. In light of this, and the fact that fatigue cracking is cycle-related, the FAA has
determined that modification of these lap joints cannot be delayed any further than 1,000 flight cycles, especially
on those airplanes that already have accumulated 20,000 flight cycles, without compromising safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the applicability of proposed paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3) be revised to clarify
that it is the ``lap joint,'' rather than the ``airplane,'' on which the particular modification has been accomplished.
The FAA concurs and has revised wording of the final rule to clarify this point.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requests that all references in the rule to ``landings'' be changed to ``cycles.'' The FAA concurs that
the reference should be revised. The FAA has reviewed the applicable service information related to this action and
finds that the majority of references to recommended compliance times are stated in ``flight cycles.'' Although
the FAA normally uses the terms ``landings'' and ``flight cycles'' interchangeably, the FAA considers that it is
appropriate in this case to change the verbiage of the AD to match that of the cited service bulletins. Therefore, in
this final rule, the FAA has substituted the term ``flight cycles'' for the term ``landings.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter, a non-U.S. operator, requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision specifying
that pressurization cycles of 2.0 psi or less need not be counted as a flight cycle when determining the number of flight
cycles relative to the proposed compliance thresholds. This commenter states that a pressurization cycle of 2.0
psi or less is a typical pressure used during flight training, and causes little fatigue damage of the kind addressed
by this AD action. The FAA does not concur. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to include various provisions in
an AD applicable to a single operator's unique use of an affected airplane. Paragraph (i) of this AD provides for the
approval of alternative methods of compliance to address these types of unique circumstances. Further, this commenter
does not compile data for each of its airplanes so that an individual airplane's pressurization cycles could be determined;
instead, it uses a fleet average to calculate the equivalent number of pressurization cycles. The FAA does not consider
it appropriate to use approximations for determining compliance with this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 116 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required inspections will entail 100 work hours per airplane per inspection, at an average labor rate of $55 per
work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $638,000, or $5,500 per airplane, per
inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required ``full'' modification will entail approximately 96 work hours for each 200-inch length of uncracked
and uncorroded lap joint, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary
for gaining access and closing up.) There are 100 lap joint sections per airplane, each with a length of 200 inches.
The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $61,248,000, or $528,000 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection following modification will entail approximately 56
work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $357,280, or $3,080 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is expected to be $62,243,280,
or $536,580 per airplane. This total cost figure includes the inspections and modification, for the first year of
the average five-year inspection cycle. Additionally, the total cost figure indicated is based on assumptions that
no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those
actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety
is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this
level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would
be redundant and unnecessary.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action revokes the Class D airspace area at Victorville, CA due to the closure of George AFB. An operational airport
traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace. The airport traffic control tower is closed, and, therefore,
the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area.

This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revokes the Class D airspace area at Victorville,
George AFB, CA. An operational airport traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace. The airport traffic
control tower is closed. Consequently, the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area. Because this action is a minor
technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure
under U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action revokes the Class D airspace area and establishes a Class E airspace area at Imperial County Airport and
modifies the El Centro NAF Class D airspace area. The airspace at Imperial County Airport was inadvertently classified
as Class D airspace. Imperial County Airport does not have an airport traffic control tower which is required for Class
D airspace, and, therefore, the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revokes the Class D airspace area and
establishes Class E airspace at Imperial County Airport, CA. The El Centro NAF, CA, Class D airspace area description
is modified to reflect this change. An operational airport traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace.
Imperial County Airport does not have an airport traffic control tower. Consequently, the FAA is revoking this Class
D airspace area. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested,
I find that notice and public procedure under U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

 The amendments contained in this document are being published as interim regulations to implement certain statutory
amendments to the Customs laws regarding administrative exemptions. These statutory amendments are contained
in the Customs modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. Also, the
interim regulations clarify the procedures for shipments brought into the United States by express consignment
operators or carriers and make clear that all shipments carried into the United States by express consignment operators
or carriers are required to be entered, unless specifically exempt from entry. These interim regulations also implement
the Customs modernization provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act exempting from
entry certain merchandise (undeliverable shipments, railway freight locomotives and cars, and instruments of
international traffic).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law Public Law 103&hyph;182, the North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act (107 Stat. 2057). Title VI of this Act, popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act (the Act)
amended certain Customs laws. Section 651 of the Act amended section 321, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C.
1321).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before its amendment by the Act, section 321 authorized administrative exemptions from duty and taxes on articles
such as gifts and personal and household goods, and in certain other situations. Specifically, section 321 authorized
the Secretary of the Treasury, in order to avoid expense and inconvenience to the Government disproportionate to
the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected, to disregard a difference of less than $10 between the duty
actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited. On the same basis, section 321 authorized the Secretary
to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $50 in the case of bona fide gifts ($100 if the
gift was from certain island possessions) sent from persons in foreign countries to persons in the United States.
Section 321 authorized the Secretary to admit free of duty and tax any article the value of which was less than $25 in
the case of personal or household articles accompanying the traveler. In all other cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if not a bona fide gift sent from a person in a foreign country to a person in the United States or a personal or household
article accompanying a traveler), the Secretary was authorized to admit free of duty and tax any article the value
of which was less than $5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the last three cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bona fide gifts, personal or household articles, and all other cases), the exemptions were subject to the condition
that the aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipment of articles imported by one person on one day could not
exceed the authorized amount. Also, the exemptions in these cases were not to be granted in any case in which merchandise
covered by a single order or contract was forwarded in separate lots to secure the benefit of the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary was authorized to prescribe regulations to implement these provisions. Section 321 specifically
authorized the Secretary to diminish any of the dollar amounts referred to above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 651 of the Act increased the dollar amounts described and, instead of setting maximum dollar amounts below
which the Secretary was authorized to make the exemptions applicable, authorized the Secretary to make the exemptions
applicable to an amount to be specified in regulations, but not less than a stated amount. That is, the amended section
321 now provides minimum dollar amounts for the exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the difference between duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited, the dollar amount
was increased to a minimum of $20. Also, this provision was changed to authorize Customs to apply the exemption to the
total of duties, fees, and taxes, instead of only duties and taxes, as had been the case. In the case of bona fide gifts,
personal or household articles, and all other cases, the dollar amounts were respectively increased to $100 ($200,
if the gift is from one of the named island possessions), $200, and $200, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 651 removed from &sect;321 the specific authorization to, by regulation, diminish any of the dollar amounts
specified in the provision. Section 651 retained the specific authorization in section 321 for regulations to prescribe
exceptions to any exemption whenever the Secretary finds such action is consistent with the purpose of the provisions
or is necessary to protect the revenue or to prevent unlawful importations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision in the Customs Regulations containing the authorization to disregard a difference of less than $10
between the duty actually due on an entry and the estimated duties deposited is found in 19 CFR 159.6. The provisions
in the Customs Regulations pertaining to the administrative exemption for bona fide gifts are found in 19 CFR 10.152
and 145.32 and the provision for personal or household articles is found in 19 CFR 148.51 (see also &sect;&sect;148.12,
148.64). The provisions in the Customs Regulations pertaining to the $5 administrative exemption for all other articles
are found in 19 CFR 10.151 and 145.31. Conditions for the exemptions provided for in 19 CFR 10.151 and 10.152 are currently
found in 19 CFR 10.153.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions pertaining to the administrative exemptions under section 321 are also found in part 128 of the Customs
Regulations, which relates to express consignments. Section 128.24(d) of that part refers to low value shipments
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
shipments valued at $5 or less) and provides that such shipments must be segregated from shipments valued at more than
$5 when the special informal entry procedures provided for in part 128 are used. This provision was intended to cover
articles which could be administratively exempted from duties and taxes under section 321(a)(2)(C) (see T.D. 89&hyph;53,
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 8, 1989 (54 FR 19561)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These interim regulations conform the Customs Regulations to the changes made to section 321 by section 651 of the
Act. In addition, the interim regulations clarify entry procedures applicable to merchandise subject to section
321. The dollar amounts currently provided for in 19 CFR 10.151 through 10.153, 145.31, 145.32, 148.12, 148.51, 148.64
and 159.6 are changed to the minimums provided for in the amended section 321. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim regulations amend part 143 to clarify the procedures for entries of shipments qualifying for the administrative
exemptions in section 321(a)(2). Shipments covered in section 321(a)(2) are included in the merchandise which may
be entered under the procedures provided for by regulation under 19 U.S.C. 1498. That provision authorizes the Secretary
of the Treasury to prescribe rules and regulations for the declaration and entry of the merchandise described in the
section. Entries which may be provided for by regulation under section 1498 are distinguished from entries which
are required to be filed under 19 U.S.C. 1484 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
formal entries). As authorized by section 1498, these amendments provide that the person who may make entry of shipments
covered by section 321(a)(2) is the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated
by one of these persons, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. Under the same authority, an amendment to part
143 makes it clear that the person who may make entry of other merchandise (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
merchandise not qualifying for the administrative exemptions in section 321(a)(2)) which qualifies for informal
entry is the owner or purchaser of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee
of the merchandise, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A corresponding amendment to part 111, concerning Customs brokers, is added to the list of transactions for which
a broker's license is not required. The new provision provides that a person entering merchandise qualifying for
and entered under the informal entry procedures authorized by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19 U.S.C. 1498 is not required to be licensed as a broker unless required to be so licensed by regulations issued under
the authority of section 1498. A reference to the provision included in part 143 is included in the new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also under the authority of 19 U.S.C. 1498, amendments are made to part 143 to clearly provide the procedures for entries
of the merchandise covered in section 321(a)(2). Shipments of such merchandise may be entered by presenting the bill
of lading (or a manifest listing each bill of lading) or other document used to file or support entry. Manifest information
is required consisting of the country of origin of the merchandise, shipper name, address and country, ultimate consignee
name and address, specific description of the merchandise, quantity, and value. Cross references are provided to
section &sect;&sect;148.12 and 148.62 to make it clear that entry by oral declaration continues to be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No amendment to the regulations is being promulgated at this time to implement the new subsection (a)(3) of section
321, added by section 651 of the Act. This provision allows Customs to waive the collection of duties, fees, and taxes
due on entered merchandise when such duties, fees, or taxes are less than $20, in order to avoid expense and inconvenience
to the Government disproportionate to the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected. Regulations implementing
this provision are being delayed pending an analysis of the expense and inconvenience to the Government in view of
the revenue involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 159.6, authorizing Customs to disregard a difference of less than $10 (now $20 under the amended section 321(a)(1))
between duties deposited and duties actually due on an entry, is amended to authorize Customs to apply the exemption
to the total of duties, fees, and taxes, as provided for in section 321(a)(1), as amended by section 651 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs also is making amendments to the Customs Regulations in part 128 relating to express consignments. These
amendments are intended to make it clear that all shipments carried into the United States by express consignment
operators and carriers are required to be entered, unless specifically exempt from entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, a 3-tier approach applies to such shipments. That is, shipments valued in excess of $1250 are required
to be formally entered, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1484 in parts 141, 142, and 143 (except subpart C) of the Customs
Regulations. Shipments valued between $200 and $1250 may be entered under the informal entry procedures, as provided
for under 19 U.S.C. 1498 (unless the shipments consist of merchandise which may not be entered under those procedures).
These procedures consist of the filing of a Customs Form 3461, either modified to cover all importations under the
special procedures for express consignment operator or carrier importations or all such importations on a daily
or flight basis, and the advance filing of the manifest information provided for in 19 CFR 128.21. This information
consists of the country of origin, shipper name, address and country, ultimate consignee name and address, specific
description of the merchandise and the tariff classification of the merchandise, quantity, shipping weight, and
value. An entry summary (Customs Form 7501) and estimated duties are required to be filed with Customs within 10 days
of release of these shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third tier is for shipments valued at $200 or less. These shipments also may be entered under the informal entry
procedures, as provided for under 19 U.S.C. 1498 (unless the shipments consist of merchandise which may not be entered
under those procedures). The procedures for these shipments are the same as those for the second-tier shipments (valued
between $200 and $1250), except that the tariff classification of the merchandise is not required for the shipments
and no entry summary or estimated duties is required to be filed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An amendment to 19 CFR 101.1, adding a definition of ``shipment'', makes it clear that the monetary exemption for third-tier
shipments is based on the bill of lading or other evidence used to file or support entry, or oral declaration when applicable.
For example, if the document used to file or support entry is an individual bill of lading to the ultimate consignee
in the United States, the monetary limitation is applied on the basis of the value of the shipment on the individual
bill of lading. This is so whether the document used to file or support entry is itself the bill of lading or an advance
manifest, as described in 19 CFR 128.21, listing each of the individual bills of lading. On the other hand, if the document
used to file or support entry is a master bill of lading (as opposed to each individual bill of lading), the monetary
limitation is applied on the basis of the total value of the shipments on the master bill of lading. The same is true of
the application of the monetary limitation in section 321(a)(2) for other importations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those not involving an express consignment entity). This is so because the definition of ``shipment'' is for general
purposes in chapter I of title 19 of the CFR, unless the context of the term requires a different meaning (see 19 CFR 101.1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is true generally under these amendments, the person who may make entry for the shipments valued between $200 and
$1250 which may be entered under the informal entry procedures is the owner or purchaser of the shipment or, when appropriately
designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the shipment, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641.
The person who may make entry for the shipments valued $200 or less which may be entered under the informal entry procedures
is the owner, purchaser, or consignee or, when appropriately designated by one of these persons, a Customs broker
licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. As discussed above, the authority for this distinction is that these entries are made
under 19 U.S.C. 1498 and the Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to prescribe rules and regulations
for the declaration and entry of such shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments are also made to part 141. Section 141.4 is amended to clarify that shipments subject to the administrative
exemptions under &sect;321(a)(2) must be entered under special informal entry procedures for lower value shipments.
Only merchandise specifically exempt from entry (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
so-called intangibles, under General Note 13 (formerly General Note 4), HTSUS, and certain vessels) is exempt from
all forms of entry. Also, a conforming amendment to the citation of the General Note in &sect;141.4 is necessary because
of the redesignation of the General Note (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General Note 4, HTSUS, the predecessor to General Note 13, was redesignated as General Note 13; see Presidential Proclamation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act amended General Note 4 (now General Note 13) by adding
other articles which are exempt from entry (section 681 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The newly added articles are articles
which are returned as undeliverable to the United States within 45 days of their departure from the United States.
The articles may not have left the custody of either the carrier or foreign customs service during that time. The departure
from the United States of articles for which the exemption is granted may not be treated as satisfying any requirement
for exportation in order to receive a benefit from, or meet an obligation to, the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment to &sect;141.4 implements this provision. The amendment requires the person claiming the exemption
to certify that the merchandise complies with the provision. In addition, the amendment requires the person claiming
the exemption to provide, upon request by Customs, any evidence necessary to support the claim.

Section 681 of the Act also added a provision to the tariff schedule exempting from entry and release requirements
railway locomotives (provided for in headings 8601 and 8602, HTSUS) and railway freight cars (provided for in heading
8606, HTSUS) on which no duty is owed (Additional U.S. Note 1, Chapter 86, HTSUS). Also, section 681 of the Act provided
for the addition of a Note to Chapter 99, HTSUS, under which certain Canadian railway freight cars provided duty-free
treatment in subheadings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9905.86.05 and 9905.86.10, HTSUS, are exempt from entry and release requirements. The railway freight cars provided
for in subheading 9905.86.05, HTSUS, are those produced before July 1, 1991, or if entered after July 1, 1994, produced
not less than 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years before the date of importation, and provided for in heading 8606, HTSUS. The railway freight cars provided for
in subheading 9905.86.10, HTSUS, are those imported for temporary use in transportation in the United States and
certified by the importer to be exported within 1 year from the date of importation and provided for in heading 8606,
HTSUS. In the case of both Notes (to be added to chapter 86 and 99, HTSUS), the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized
by regulation to establish appropriate reporting requirements and to require that a bond be posted to ensure compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to &sect;141.4 implements these provisions. In the case of railway locomotives and freight cars which
are exempt from entry on the basis that no duty is owed on them and they are classified in headings 8601, 8602, or 8606,
HTSUS (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, without reference to subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS), no special evidentiary requirement is imposed
because duty-free treatment is not conditioned on any special condition (other than duty-free status because of
origin). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of railway freight cars which are exempt from entry by virtue of subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS,
because there are conditions other than the absence of duty being owed on the freight cars, the amendment contains
special evidentiary requirements. The requirements, concerning the time of production of the freight car and the
duration of the stay in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States of the freight car, shall be met by a certification (documentary or electronic), subject to Customs
verification. In the case of the requirement to export the freight car within 1 year from the date of importation, in
subheading 9905.86.10, HTSUS, the amendment specifically provides that a freight car admitted into the United States
under this provision which is not exported within the 1 year period becomes subject to entry and the payment of any applicable
duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As authorized by the statutory provision, the amendment provides that locomotives and freight cars described in
Additional U.S. Note 1 of Chapter 86, HTSUS, and freight cars described in subheading 9905.86.05 or 9905.86.10, HTSUS,
may be released only after the importer has filed a bond on Customs Form 301, containing either the basic importation
and entry conditions (19 CFR 113.62) or the international carrier bond conditions (19 CFR 113.64). Amendments to
19 CFR 123.12 are added concerning the entry of foreign locomotives and equipment in international traffic, to add
references to the provisions implementing these provisions.

Instruments of International Traffic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 681 of the Act added a provision to the tariff schedule exempting from formal entry procedures instruments
of international traffic, such as containers, lift vans, rail cars and locomotives, truck cabs and trailers, etc.
The provision also provided for the periodic reporting and payment of fees associated with the importation of such
instruments of international traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption from entry for instruments of international traffic is already provided for in the Customs Regulations
(see 19 CFR 10.41a). There are no fees associated with the importation of instruments of international traffic. Therefore,
no substantive amendment to the Customs Regulations is necessary to implement this provision. However, to alert
the public to the exemption from entry for instruments of international traffic, a provision is added referring to
this exemption from entry and 19 CFR 10.41a in the list of exceptions from the general rule in &sect;141.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Customs is promulgating on an interim basis amendments as described above and set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Delayed Effective Date and Public Comment Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency intends that these interim regulations become effective on the 45th day following the date of publication,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 15 days after the close of the comment period. The agency believes it has good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1) and (3)
of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) to promulgate interim regulations because the regulations
provide an immediate benefit to both the Government and the public by increasing exemptions which already exist.
These interim regulations are intended to implement Congressional intent embodied in 19 U.S.C. 1321, as amended,
that these exemptions, when granted, should exist at statutory minimums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, existing rights and obligations are not otherwise changed. The agency believes the public wants these
new statutory minimums to become effective as soon as possible as the public should benefit from the efficiencies
and savings resulting therefrom. In addition, the agency does not believe the public needs time to conform its conduct
so as to avoid violation of these regulations. The due and timely execution of the agency's responsibilities would
be unnecessarily impeded by a time consuming notice and comment period. The agency believes such delay is unnecessary
because it does not expect the public to object to the regulations being promulgated as they merely provide the relief
that Congress intended.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even though, based on the discussion set forth above, Customs believes the amendments in this document may be promulgated
on an interim basis and could be effective immediately, Customs is providing a 45-day delayed effective date, with
a 30 day comment period preceding that effective date. This represents a practical compromise between the need for
temporal urgency and the desirability of public participation in the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the spirit of the APA, the agency is soliciting public comment regarding its decision to promulgate these interim
regulations and in delaying their effective date only for that period of time necessary to review any relevant comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding that decision. Unless the comments show that there exists good cause for not making the regulations effective
on an interim basis, the regulations will become effective on an interim basis on the 45th day following the date of
publication.

Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, the agency hereby solicits comments on both the substance of these regulations and their intended
effective date. The comments should clearly state whether they address the substance of the interim rule or the agency's
determination to make the rule effective on an interim basis. If, based on the comments, good cause is shown that the
regulations should not become effective on an interim basis, a document will be issued withdrawing the interim regulations
before their effective date. If no such good cause is shown, the interim regulations will go into effect. The agency
will then be able to gain experience with the interim regulation, fully consider substantive comments, and decide
whether the interim regulation needs amendment before its promulgation as a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably in triplicate) that are timely submitted to Customs.
All such comments received from the public pursuant to this notice of rulemaking will be available for public inspection
in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

covered by a single order or contract and that it was sent separately for the express purpose of securing free entry
therefor or of avoiding compliance with any pertinent law or regulation. Merchandise subject to this exemption shall

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is issuing revised Forest Highway (FH) Program regulations to conform to the requirements of the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Section 1032 of the ISTEA amends, among other things, 23 United
States Code (U.S.C.) 202 and 204 to combine the FH category with the public lands highway category. The revised regulation
will ensure expeditious and proper allocation of funds to provide public road access to the National Forest System
(NFS).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 18, 1991, the President signed the ISTEA, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914. Section 1032 of the
ISTEA amends 23 U.S.C. 202 and 204 by, among other things, incorporating new planning provisions, including metropolitan
and statewide transportation plan requirements; establishing management systems provisions, including highway
safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway pavements; adding and revising definitions for key
terms relating to the Federal Lands Highway Program; and modifying existing allocation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of the Federal Lands Highway Program is to provide public road funding to serve the Federal lands
outside State or local government responsibility. Typically, the facilities serve recreational travel and tourism,
protect and enhance natural resources, provide sustained economic development in rural areas, and provide needed
transportation for Native Americans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA's partnership with the Forest Service (FS) began in 1916 when the Federal-Aid Road Act appropriated funds
for the construction and maintenance of roads and trails serving the national forests. There are currently over 25,000
miles of FHs, on State and local transportation systems, serving 191 million acres of national forest lands in 40 States
plus Puerto Rico. These roads connect to the approximately 370,000 miles of forest development roads that are under
the jurisdiction of the FS. The fiscal year 1994 (FY 94) authorization for FHs was $113 million. On October 5, 1993,
the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 51794). The following discussion addresses comments to the NPRM which were provided to the FHWA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule was developed by an interagency task force of the FHWA and the FS. The FHWA and the FS considered the comments
received to the Docket for the regulation in developing the revisions to the NPRM for the final rule.

Relationship to Interim Guidance Issued December 26, 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 26, 1991, the FHWA issued interim guidance to aid States and the FS in complying with the new legislative
requirements. The guidance was developed in consultation with FS headquarters staff and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 57 FR 14880 on April 23, 1992. This interim guidance is superseded by this regulation.

Written Comments Received to the Docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters submitted 29 comments to the Docket regarding the NPRM. One Federal agency and five State highway agencies
(SHAs) commented on the NPRM. The majority of commenters offered specific suggestions for revisions. Some also offered
minor editorial corrections and text enhancements. Most of the significant comments were directed at &sect;660.105_Planning
and route designation_and at &sect;660.107_Allocations. All comments were considered and have been accommodated
to the extent practical. In response to these comments, the FHWA has developed a final rule. A summary of the specific
responses to comments raised on individual sections of the NPRM follows:

One commenter expressed the need to better describe the importance of the FH Program for access to and management of
the NFS and its role as an integral part of the Federal Lands Highway Program.

This section was expanded to better describe how the FH Program enhances local, regional, and national benefits of
FHs funded under the Public Lands Highway category of the coordinated Federal Lands Highway Program. The FH Program
provides safe and adequate transportation access to and through National Forest System (NFS) lands for visitors,
recreationists, resource users, and others which is not met by other transportation programs, assists rural and
community economic development, and promotes tourism and travel.

One commenter suggested that the definition of ``public authority'' be modified so that a public authority would
be required to meet all authorities noted in the NPRM definition by changing the ``or'' condition to an ``and'' condition
regarding the public authority's authority to finance, build, operate, ``or'' maintain toll or toll-free facilities.

Because this definition is a title 23, U.S.C., definition, it was not revised, even though the ``and'' condition would
make it more restrictive. Regulations may clarify or explain, but cannot revise, a statutory definition.

Another commenter suggested revising the definition of ``forest road'' to include a road which provides ``access
to'' the NFS since many FHs in some States do not meet the criteria of a forest road as indicated by the proposed definition.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is also a title 23, U.S.C., definition and was not revised in the final rule. The present wording for the definition
of ``forest road,'' as stated in 23 U.S.C. 101, is: ``The term forest road or trail means a road or trail wholly or partly
within, or adjacent to, and serving the NFS and which is necessary for the protection, administration, and utilization
of the NFS and the use and development of its resources.'' This definition is adequate because a road which provides
access to the NFS is considered to be serving the NFS. Also, the definition for FH allows for roads providing access
to the NFS since it refers to forest roads, the definition of which allows access to the NFS.

Similar wording was used in the definition of Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in this section. Therefore,
the phrase was added to the end of the definition to clarify it. Also, a definition for ``metropolitan transportation
plan'' was added to this section because the term is used in &sect;660.105 along with the term ``statewide transportation
plan,'' which is also defined in this regulation in &sect;660.103.

Some minor wording changes were made to paragraph (a) of this section to reflect the fact that the FS will provide resource
planning and related transportation information to the ``appropriate'' MPO in accordance with part 450 of this title.
This clarification was needed because there are numerous MPOs within some States and the FS should direct the information
only to the MPO needing the information.

Two of the SHAs felt that paragraph (b) should be clarified to delineate the reporting responsibilities for management
information systems. One felt the final rule should specify that the State would be responsible for pavement, bridge,
and safety management systems where the FH is also a State highway and that cities and counties would be responsible
for those management systems where FHs are under city or county jurisdiction. The FS would then be responsible for
those management systems on all other applicable roads.

Title 23, U.S.C., 303 requires the States to develop and implement systems for managing highway pavements of Federal-aid
highways (pavement management systems), bridges on and off Federal-aid highways (bridge management systems),
and highway safety for all public roads (safety management systems). The results of bridge management systems and
safety management systems on all FHs and results of pavement management systems for FHs on Federal-aid highways are
to be provided by the SHAs for consideration in the development of programs under &sect;660.109 of this part. The FHWA
will provide appropriate pavement management results for FHs which are not Federal-aid highways. The last two sentences
in paragraph (b) were reworded to clarify these procedures and be more in concert with 23 U.S.C. 204(a).

One commenter recommended that paragraph (c)(1) be clarified by adding the word ``forest'' before the word ``roads''
to be more consistent with previous definitions and to clarify candidate roads for nomination. This would clarify
the fact that the SHA and the FS will nominate ``forest'' roads, not just any roads, for FH designation. The FH definition
also references forest roads.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter noted the restrictiveness of the NPRM in that it limits the funding of the allocated portion of the Public
Lands Highway Program exclusively to FHs. The commenter further pointed out that the 1991 ISTEA amended 23 U.S.C.
202 by striking the subsection that dealt with FHs as a part of the Public Lands Highway Program with the result that,
according to the commenter, one-third of the allocated program may be spent on highways other than FHs. Under this
broader definition of Public Lands Highways, the States would have the flexibility to spend the allocated portion
of PLH funds on all kinds of highways such as the Bureau of Land Management roads and even Indian Reservation Roads.
The ``equal consideration'' language of the ISTEA, in the commenter's view, would allow for at least half of the allocated
funds to be spent on such roads while the NPRM language restricts the allocated portion to FHs only.

The conference report on ISTEA states that ``Sixty-six percent of the public lands highway account shall be allocated
to the Forest Service regional offices for use in 41 States based on the FH criteria. The remaining 34 percent shall
be allocated by the Secretary based on national competition for other forest or public lands highways.'' (H.R. Conf.
Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 331 (1991).) Therefore, the interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 202(b) is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Thirty-four percent of the public lands highway funds shall be allocated in a discretionary manner, giving preference
to States that contain at least 3 percent of the total public lands in the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sixty-six percent of the public lands highway funds are to be allocated to the FS Regions in accordance with section
134 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, 101
Stat. 132, 173). Section 134 pertained to the allocation of FH funds, which is part of the Public Lands Highway category.
Therefore, the language of this section was not changed.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the SHAs took exception to the fact that this section requires the allocation of Public Lands Highway Funds by
FS Region, citing an apparent inconsistency with section 134 of the STURAA which allocates ``for expenditure in each
State.'' It was suggested that, for some States which have more than one FS Region, allocation by FS Region potentially
creates difficulties, such as competition or conflicts between States, and that FH funds should continue to be allocated
as outlined in the STURAA. Also, because the ISTEA requires that all FS projects be included in each State's ``Statewide
Transportation Improvement Program'' (STIP), allocation of funds by State would make it easier for each State to
project available funding and projects for inclusion in its STIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM may have given the appearance that the allocation method is being changed. Actually, the NPRM proposed to
continue with the same FH allocation method which has been in existence since FY 85. If FH funds were to be allocated
to the States, 34 States would have their ``hold harmless'' funds reduced by an aggregate total of approximately $90
million per year (based on FY 94 allocation amounts). This represents nearly 85 percent of the total FY 94 FH funds allocation.
The regulation will continue with the allocation in its present form.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the word ``elements,'' used in the NPRM to state that the allocation of funds for FHs uses
values based on relative transportation needs of the various elements of the NFS, should be replaced with the word
``resources.'' The commenter pointed out that the word ``element'' is used in the definition of renewable resources
and could be construed to limit allocations based on renewable resources only. The commenter also believes the term
``resources'' was defined to include both renewable and nonrenewable resources and is more appropriate to use in
defining the allocation process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This wording was carried forward from the previous wording of the existing regulation. However, the sentence was
clarified by deleting the entire phrase ``the various elements of,'' thereby eliminating the need for referring
to either ``resources'' or ``elements.'' It now refers only to ``using values based on relative transportation needs
of the NFS.''

One commenter proposed that a seventh FH project selection criterion should be added to the existing six criteria
in paragraph (a) of this section. The new criterion, which would read: ``The results for forest highways from the pavement,
bridge, and safety management systems'' is needed to comply with &sect;660.105(b) of this part, which discusses
the management systems required under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135. It would also have to be consistent with any changes made
in 23 U.S.C. 105.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

with the FS and the State Highway Agency (SHA) to jointly select the projects which will be included in the programs.

Under current procedures, the State represents the interests of the cooperators. The program meetings are always
open to interested cooperators who may wish to attend. The States may invite cooperators to the meetings, if they wish.
Thus, there is no need to change the wording of the NPRM.

The previous commenter also called attention to paragraph (a) of the NPRM which stated that the FS and the SHA will ``jointly
select the projects which will be included in the programs for the current fiscal year and at least the next 4 years.''
The commenter recommended that, since the projects selected will ultimately be added to the STIP, the planning and
selection of FH projects should cover the same timeframe as the STIP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, at least 5 years are needed to identify early environmental and other preliminary engineering required
to ensure meeting the schedule to advance a project to construction. The proposed FH timeframe is consistent with
this since the TIP generally shows 3 years of the 5-year FH program. Thus, there is no need to change the wording of the
NPRM.

One commenter requested that, in paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``recommended,'' as used in the first sentence,
``The recommended program will be prepared by the FHWA and concurred in by the FS and the SHA,'' should be replaced with
the term ``selected.'' This would more accurately reflect the current procedure, as stated in paragraph (a), that
the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA will ``jointly select the projects,'' not just recommend them. One of the SHAs felt the
second sentence should be revised to read, ``The FHWA will approve the program `only when there is concurrence by the
FS and the SHA.''' Otherwise, the FHWA could conceivably approve the program without waiting for concurrence by the
other two agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A review of this section indicated that the wording of the NPRM may still create some confusion, even with the recommended
word changes, because the first two sentences of paragraph (b) state that ``The recommended program will be prepared
by the FHWA and concurred in by the FS and the SHA'' and that ``The FHWA will approve the program.'' This would make it
appear that the FHWA simply prepares and approves its own program. Consequently, the wording of the first sentence
of this paragraph was revised to read: ``The recommended program will be prepared and approved by the FHWA with concurrence
by the FS and the SHA.'' The second sentence was deleted.

One commenter pointed out that the term ``incorporate,'' as used in the third sentence of NPRM paragraph (b), which
states that ``the SHA shall advise any other cooperators in the State of the projects included in the final program
and shall incorporate the approved program into the STIP,'' seems vague. It appears to imply that the approved FH program
is independent of the regional and statewide STIP planning requirements of the ISTEA. The commenter felt that, although
this may be the correct way to handle a program of this nature, the process required to ``incorporate'' the final program
into the STIP should be clarified.

One commenter felt that the 41 statewide FH agreements currently in effect between the FHWA and the States (including
Puerto Rico) should be updated and made into tri-party agreements with the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA. This would perpetuate
the ``partnership'' spirit of the ISTEA and facilitate cooperation among the three agencies. It would also eliminate
separate agreements between the FS and the SHA and between the FHWA and the SHA in each State. The wording of this section
should be revised by inserting the words ``the Forest Service'' where necessary, such as after the word ``FHWA'' in
paragraph (a), to include the FS as a signatory agency to the agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because there are some overall FH procedures that not only involve the SHAs, but the FS as well, tri-party agreements
among the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA will be a requirement in the final rule. Because the FHWA and the FS already have separate
two-party FH program agreements for all 40 States, plus Puerto Rico, and because the FHWA does not want to delay the
FH program until all new tri-party agreements are executed, the first sentence of this section of the NPRM was revised
to delete the phrase ``prior to the expenditure of any funds by the FHWA in the State.''

One commenter suggested that, in the first sentence of paragraph (a), the phrase ``or a public authority'' should
be added after the words ``Projects will be administered by the FHWA.'' This would acknowledge that the FS may, in some
cases, administer the design and construction of FH projects. The same commenter also suggested adding the phrase
``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' to the end of the sentence to allow for items included in
statewide agreements to supplement Federal-aid procedures, where appropriate.

Because the FS wants to be able to administer FH projects, this sentence was reworded to add the words ``or the FS'' instead
of ``or a public authority.'' Also, the phrase ``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' was added
to the end of the sentence. This will allow the parties to determine the procedures to be followed in a State.

One commenter suggested that the words ``a public authority'' be substituted for ``cooperator'' in paragraph (b)
of this section. This would allow the FS to perform construction, if appropriate. Cooperators would still be included
since they are, by definition, a public authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because other public authorities that might potentially be involved in a project would also be cooperators, the word
``cooperator'' was kept in the sentence in paragraph (b). However, by adding the words ``the FS'' after FHWA, the FS
will be explicitly allowed to perform construction, if appropriate. Also, paragraph (c), which deals with final
acceptance of the project, was revised to clarify the intent. The word ``construction'' was retained in the language
to differentiate acceptance of the construction work (for the purpose of releasing the contractor) from that of acceptance
of the entire project, including any extra work required to resolve noncontractor-related matters.

In dealing with the same issue discussed in the previous section, as to what constitutes final acceptance of a project,
it was suggested by one commenter that the word ``construction'' be deleted to avoid confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``construction'' is not incorrect in the context of this paragraph, because it describes the type of acceptance
being made. However, the entire sentence was reworded to clarify and minimize possible confusion. By referencing
&sect;660.113(c), which includes the word ``construction,'' the meaning of the term ``construction acceptance''
was retained.

One commenter suggested deleting the phrase ``and the SHAs'' from paragraph (e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the term ``cooperators'' includes SHAs, the phrase was considered redundant and, therefore, deleted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested adding the word ``Generally'' at the beginning of the sentence in paragraph (f) to allow for
those special cases where cash is not obtained in advance of construction procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adding the word ``generally'' to the sentence makes the requirement too much less restrictive. Instead, the following
phrase was added to the end of the last sentence: ``Unless otherwise specified in a project agreement.'' Also, the
word ``shall'' was changed to ``should'' to allow more flexibility.

and Procedures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has determined that this action is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within
the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic
impact of this rulemaking would be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This rule merely
requires the States and Federal agencies to conform to the requirements of the ISTEA. The requirements are basically
incremental to what the States and Federal agencies are required to do under the new ISTEA provisions, such as incorporating
new planning provisions, including metropolitan and statewide transportation plan requirements; and establishing
management systems provisions, including highway safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway
pavements.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation,
the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The revised regulation will not directly affect small businesses because the regulation applies only
to Federal agency, State, and local government transportation programs. However, a minor positive secondary effect
may result from the employment of small businesses, such as engineering consultant firms, to implement some of the
planning and management systems required by the ISTEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Forest Highway (FH) Program which enhances local, regional, and national
benefits of FHs funded under the public lands highway category of the coordinated Federal Lands Highway Program.
As provided in 23 U.S.C. 202, 203, and 204, the program, developed in cooperation with State and local agencies, provides
safe and adequate transportation access to and through National Forest System (NFS) lands for visitors, recreationists,
resource users, and others which is not met by other transportation programs. Forest highways assist rural and community
economic development and promote tourism and travel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1 of each fiscal year, the FHWA will allocate 66 percent of Public Lands Highway funds, by FS Region, for FHs
using values based on relative transportation needs of the NFS, after deducting such sums as deemed necessary for
the administrative requirements of the FHWA and the FS; the necessary costs of FH planning studies; and the FH share
of costs for approved Federal Lands Coordinated Technology Implementation Program studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62560), EPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The NPR proposed two actions:
(a) A limited approval/limited disapproval of the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation, Chapter 129.82
submitted on March 4, 1992; and (b) approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by section 6.7(b), (c), and (h) and section
17(2) of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act as amended on June 29, I992. EPA proposed the approval of Chapter
129.82 as supplemented by sections of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act in the event that Pennsylvania submitted
those sections of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act as a formal SIP revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since Pennsylvania has not submitted the applicable sections from its Air Pollution Control Act as amended on June
29, 1992, EPA is withdrawing its proposed approval of Chapter 129.82 as supplemented by section 6.7(b), (c), and (h)
and section 17(2) of the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act, as amended on June 29, 1992. Therefore, this notice
is a final rulemaking action of the March 4, 1992 submittal alone. Other specific requirements of Pennsylvania's
Stage II regulation and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here.
Only one comment pertaining to the NPR was received. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DER)
requested that EPA withhold final action on the Stage II vapor recovery regulation submitted on March 4, I992 until
EPA resolves the issues concerning applicability of Stage II in moderate ozone nonattainment areas. EPA has no issues
to resolve concerning Stage II in moderate ozone nonattainment areas. The onboard vapor recovery requirements required
to be issued prior to January 22, 1994 do not affect requirements in the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter
129.82. States are free to continue to enforce Stage II regulations in moderate ozone nonattainment areas, even after
the promulgation of onboard vapor recovery requirements by EPA. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its limited approval/limited
disapproval of the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82, and the associated definition of gasoline
dispensing facilities located in Chapter 121.1, which is applicable in moderate, serious and severe ozone nonattainment
areas in the Commonwealth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the definition of gasoline dispensing facility in Chapter 121 and the Stage II vapor recovery requirements
in Chapter 129.82 as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP. EPA is also disapproving the Stage II vapor recovery requirements
in Chapter 129.82 for the limited purpose of allowing Pennsylvania the opportunity to correct the testing and certification
requirement deficiencies previously identified by EPA. This final limited disapproval begins the 18 month sanctions
clock for the Pennsylvania Stage II regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the previously identified deficiencies, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 110(k)(3)
and part D. Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements
of the CAA, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted rule(s) under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority
pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval
is limited because EPA's action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does
not meet the section 182(b)(3) requirement of part D because of the noted deficiencies. Thus, EPA is approving the
Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation, Chapter 129.82 submitted under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of
the CAA for the limited purpose of strengthening the Pennsylvania SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also disapproving the Pennsylvania Stage II rule because it contains deficiencies that have not been corrected
and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2),
if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based
on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one
of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval.
Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: highway funding and offsets. The 18 month
period referred to in section 179(a) begins at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover,
the final disapproval triggers the Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). The 18 month
sanctions clock for the Pennsylvania Stage II vapor recovery regulation begins on June 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval.
Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval
of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements
and impose any new Federal requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866,
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action, pertaining to the Pennsylvania
Stage II regulation, Chapter 129.82, must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit
by August 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the
finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial
review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged
later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

 NMFS implements provisions of the International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA) that make it unlawful, after June
1, 1994, for any person, to sell, purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship, in the United States, any tuna or tuna
product that is not dolphin safe. The intent of this action is to ensure that the U.S. market does not act as an incentive
to the harvest of tuna caught in association with dolphins or with driftnets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS is required to monitor the importation of certain fish and fish products to ensure compliance with various provisions
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as amended by the IDCA and the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information
Act (DPCIA). The IDCA states, among other things, that ``It is the policy of the United States.. to ensure that the market
of the United States does not act as an incentive to the harvest of tuna caught in association with dolphins or with driftnets.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IDCA makes it unlawful, after June 1, 1994, for any person to sell, purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship,
in the United States, any tuna or tuna product that is not dolphin safe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna, or a tuna product, is not dolphin safe if it contains tuna that was harvested on the high seas by a vessel engaged
in fishing with driftnets 2.5 km or longer in length (``large-scale driftnets''). As of May&blank;31, 1994, the Secretary
had not identified any nation whose vessels are engaging in fishing with large-scale driftnets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna or a product containing tuna that was harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) by a vessel 400 short
tons (362.8 metric tons (mt)) carrying capacity or greater, is dolphin safe only if it is accompanied by two written
statements: one executed by the captain of the vessel that harvested the tuna, certifying that purse seine nets were
not intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins at any time during the fishing trip (captain's statement);
and the other from a NMFS or Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission official certifying that there was an approved
observer on board the vessel during the entire trip and that purse seine nets were not intentionally deployed during
the trip on, or to encircle, dolphins (observer's statement). Both the captain's and the observer's statements must
be endorsed in writing by each exporter, importer, and processor of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna or a product containing tuna harvested outside the ETP by a purse seine vessel, is dolphin safe if it is accompanied
by a captain's statement, certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on, or to encircle, dolphins
during the particular voyage on which the tuna was harvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuna or a product containing tuna harvested outside the ETP by a purse seine vessel in a fishery in which the Secretary
has determined that a regular and significant association occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which tuna
is harvested through the use of purse seine nets deployed on, or to encircle, marine mammals, is dolphin safe if it is
accompanied by a captain's statement and an observer's statement. As of May&blank;31, 1994, the Secretary had not
made such a determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS anticipates that the dolphin-safe documentation requirements of the IDCA and this final rule will primarily
affect tuna harvested with purse seine nets outside of the ETP. In accordance with the importation requirements of
50 CFR 216.24(e), all tuna, other than fresh, is required to be accompanied by a NOAA Form 370 ``Fisheries Certificate
of Origin'' (FCO) upon importation into the United States. NMFS believes that most tuna marketed in the United States
(U.S.-harvested, as well as imports) is labeled ``dolphin safe'' in accordance with DPCIA labeling standards. Therefore,
most tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying capacity or greater and sold
in the United States meets the dolphin-safe documentation requirements (i.e., it is accompanied by an FCO, as well
as captain's and observer's statements and endorsements). For imported tuna harvested outside the ETP by a purse
seine vessel, this regulation requires that a captain's statement be attached to the FCO. In addition, for tuna harvested
outside the ETP by a U.S. purse seine vessel, this regulation requires a captain's statement. The FCO's must be endorsed
by each exporter, importer, and processor of the tuna, as described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Customs Service (USCS) controls the importation of tuna and tuna products into the United States. USCS will
verify that a captain's statement accompanies shipments of tuna and tuna product containing tuna harvested by purse
seine outside the ETP, and that a captain's statement and an observer's statement, endorsed in writing by every exporter,
importer, and processor, accompany tuna or tuna product containing tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is codified in 50 CFR 216.24(e)(9). The former text of paragraph 216.24(e)(9) that is replaced by this regulation
was effective only through 1986. Therefore, deletion of that language has no regulatory effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule codifies statutory requirements and prohibitions that became effective pursuant to the IDCA after June
1, 1994. Therefore, under authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists to waive the notice and comment
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act as such procedures are unnecessary. Further, in that this rule
incorporates a statutory requirement already in effect, good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day
delay in effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collections
found at 50 CFR 216.24(e) have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Control
Number 0648&hyph;0040 for tuna or a tuna product that contains tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of 400
short tons (362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity or greater and that is labeled ''dolphin safe.'' The public reporting
burden for this collection was previously estimated to be 0.66 hours per response, including the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information (56 FR 47418, September 19, 1991). The IDCA now mandates that the same reporting requirement
apply to all tuna or tuna products containing tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP by these vessels, and it is expected
that the same reporting burden will apply. In addition, all tuna or tuna products containing tuna harvested by purse
seine vessel outside the ETP must now be accompanied by the captain's statement described above. The reporting burden
for the completion of the captain's statement for tuna harvested by purse seine outside of the ETP is estimated to be
0.083 hours per response. Also, tuna harvested outside the ETP must now be accompanied by an FCO and captain's statement.
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or on any other aspect of this collection of information, including
suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (see ADDRESSES) and to the Office of
Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 0648&hyph;0400, Washington, D.C. 20503 (Attn: NOAA Desk Officer).

 The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut
Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol
Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this inseason action pursuant to
IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State
of the United States of America (58 FR 17791, April 6, 1993). On behalf of the IPHC, this inseason action is published

North Washington Coast Sport Fishery to Close
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The north Washington coast (waters west of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line and south to the Queets River) sport halibut harvest
through May 22 is 47,699 lb (21.6 mt). It is anticipated that the catch limit of 68,039 lb (30.9 mt) for this area will
be reached on May 28. Therefore, the sport halibut fishery in this area will close at 11:59 p.m. on May 28, and remain
closed for the remainder of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anglers have landed an estimated 6,500 lb (3.0 mt) of Pacific halibut in Neah Bay, WA, that were caught in Canadian waters.
Fishing remains open in Canadian waters with a two fish daily bag limit, no size restriction. Anglers desiring to fish
in Canadian waters are strongly urged to contact Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans at (604) 666-0383/0583
for sport fishing information concerning licensing and the nautical description of closed areas.

 NMFS is prohibiting retention of Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands
management area (BSAI). NMFS is requiring that catches of Greenland turbot in the BS be treated in the same manner as
prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the Greenland turbot
total allowable catch (TAC) in the BS has been reached.

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the BS was established by the final 1994
initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59
FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 4,667 metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS has determined in accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(9), that the Greenland turbot
TAC in the BS has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of Greenland turbot in the BS be treated
as prohibited species in accordance with &sect;675.20(c)(3), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 8, 1994, until
12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) restricts the operation of longer combination
vehicles (LCV's) on the Interstate Highway System and commercial motor vehicle (CMV) combinations with two or more
cargo-carrying units on the National Network (NN) to the types of vehicles in use on or before June 1, 1991, subject
to whatever State restrictions were in effect on that date. The ISTEA also includes special variances from the June
1 date for Alaska, Ohio, and Wyoming. As required by the ISTEA and based on information provided by the States, industry,
and the public, the final rule lists applicable limitations by specific vehicle combination, by State, in effect
on June 1, 1991, and does not further restrict the operation of any vehicle in lawful operation on or before June 1, 1991.
This rule also establishes criteria for States to make minor adjustments to the list of limitations; defines certain
terms, such as ``nondivisible load,'' ``beverage container,'' and ``maxi-cube'' vehicle; makes technical amendments
to the list of federally-designated routes on the NN; and makes other minor changes to conform existing regulations
to the ISTEA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1023 of the ISTEA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1951, codified at 23 U.S.C. 127(d)) required States,
within 60 days of the date of enactment, to submit to the Secretary of Transportation for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 30 days thereafter a complete list of (1) all operations of LCV's being conducted as of June 1, 1991; (2) State laws,
regulations, and any other limitations and conditions, including routing-specific and configuration-specific
designations governing the operation of LCV's; and (3) a copy of such laws, regulations, limitations, and conditions.
An LCV is defined in the ISTEA as any combination of a truck tractor and two or more trailers or semitrailers which operates
on the Interstate System at a gross vehicle weight greater than 80,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, section 4006 of the ISTEA (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j)) required the States to submit a complete list of State
length limitations applicable to CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units in effect on or before June
1, 1991. This section prohibits States from allowing the operation (by statute, regulation, permit, or other means)
of CMV's with cargo-carrying unit lengths that exceed the length, by specific configuration, allowed and in actual,
lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) on the NN in that State
on or before June 1, 1991. The NN is defined in 23 CFR 658.5, and includes the Interstate System, with minor exceptions,
and selected non-Interstate routes. The non-Interstate NN highways are listed in appendix A to part 658. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1023 and 4006 provide that no statute or regulation shall be included on the list submitted by a State or published
by the Secretary merely on the grounds that it authorized, or could have authorized, by permit or otherwise, the operation
of LCV or CMV combinations not in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis on or before June 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may continue to issue special permits, in accordance with applicable State laws, for those vehicles and loads
which cannot be easily dismantled or divided. A definition of such nondivisible loads is included in this final rule.

The ISTEA included three narrow exceptions to the June 1, 1991, freeze date. Wyoming would have been able to allow the
operation of additional vehicle configurations not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, provided they were authorized
by State law not later than November 3, 1992. No additional vehicles were authorized, however, and accordingly no
additional vehicles are included in appendix C over those listed in the previous two rulemakings on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio may allow LCV's with three cargo-carrying units of 28.5 feet each (not including the truck tractor) not in actual
operation on June 1, 1991, to be operated within its boundaries on the 1-mile segment of Ohio State Route 7 which begins
at, and extends south of, Exit 16 on the Ohio Turnpike. Alaska may continue to allow the operation of CMV's which were
not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but which were in actual operation prior to July 6, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A preliminary list of the information provided by the States in response to sections 1023 and 4006 was published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on March 20, 1992 (57 FR 9900). A second proposed list of vehicles and restrictions,
including corrections, clarifications, and additional material submitted to the docket in response to the NPRM
was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) on February 25, 1993 (58 FR 11450). In the NPRM
the information provided by the States was organized into appendices C and D to part 658; in the SNPRM that information
was combined into a single list of vehicles and restrictions and presented as a new appendix C. The format of the SNPRM
has been retained for the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to publication of the SNPRM, 154 sets of comments were received from 136 separate entities. The vast majority
of those comments deal with specifics on the information published in the SNPRM, and they will be discussed under individual
topical headings. Four of the commenters, however, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), the Wyoming
Trucking Association, Inc. (WTA), the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, and the Citizens
for Reliable And Safe Highways (CRASH), provided comments concerning the rulemaking in general, and the philosophy
used by the FHWA in presenting the information. These particular comments provide an opportunity for the FHWA to explain
its approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA stipulates that the ``final list'' of LCV operational requirements for each State be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not later than 180 days after the date of enactment. That date was June 15, 1992. The lead comment by the CRASH in its docket
submission was that publication of the final list by the FHWA was ``long overdue.'' The CRASH contends that since the
freeze does not take effect until the Secretary publishes the final list, the FHWA's delay in publication has prevented
the law from taking effect. This in turn means that LCV's may today be operating on highways from which Congress intended
they be barred. It concludes this comment by stating that the review and correction process included with the final
rule can be used to make corrections after publication of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the FHWA stated in the Supplementary Information section of the SNPRM, the content of the States' original responses
to the ISTEA request for LCV operational information covered the full range of what could be supplied, both in terms
of items covered and volume of material. The diversity of the contents of the responses was so great that the FHWA determined
that before any list could be finalized, increased uniformity both in terms of items covered and the type of information
would be necessary. Thus, despite the likelihood that the statutory due date for a final rule might be missed, the FHWA
determined that it was in the public's interest to publish a SNPRM soliciting further public comment on revisions
to the initial list. The FHWA considered publishing a ``final list'' without this additional public procedure, but
believed that the list published at that stage would have required numerous subsequent changes. We believe that the
intent of Congress in including a correction process was to take care of relatively minor single-issue situations
which may be discovered after publication of this final rule, not to make wholesale changes in a State's submission
without good cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA expressed concern that the interpretations used by the FHWA in developing this rule have involved many combination
vehicles that, until passage of the ISTEA, were not considered by anyone to be LCV's. In a similar vein, Alaska commented
that the SNPRM ``seeks to significantly expand the ISTEA legislation and, we believe, severely constrains the states'
abilities to legitimately regulate commercial traffic within each state.''

This final rule implements two similar, yet separate provisions of the ISTEA. Section 1023, as discussed earlier,
involves LCV's and includes an LCV definition. The scope of vehicle combinations covered by this section is narrow.
The definition requires that an LCV combination include a truck tractor, which by previous congressional action
(section 411(f), Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982) is defined as a noncargo-carrying power
unit and two or more trailers or semitrailers. The combination must operate on the Interstate System, and its gross
vehicle weight must be in excess of 80,000 pounds. The vehicles listed in appendix C as a result of this statutory definition
include only what might best be described as the ``traditional'' LCV's, that is, the ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike''
Doubles and the ``Triple.'' Under the definition of LCV provided by the ISTEA, it is true that the State of Alaska has
no LCV's because it has no Interstate System mileage in the sense used in the ISTEA; that is, Alaska does not have Interstate
System mileage designated under 23 U.S.C. 103(e), 139(a), or 139(b). Accordingly, all references to LCV's for Alaska
have been deleted from this final rule.

Alaska does, however, have mileage that is part of the NN. Section 4006 of the ISTEA requires the FHWA to include in the
final list ``any commercial motor vehicle combination *&blank;*&blank;* with 2 or more cargo carrying units.''
A ``cargo-carrying unit'' is defined as ``any portion of a commercial motor vehicle combination *&blank;*&blank;*
used for carrying cargo, including a trailer, semitrailer, or the cargo carrying section of a single unit truck.''
While section 1023 is relatively narrow in scope, section 4006 has very widespread applicability. If, as the WTA contends,
vehicles not previously considered to be LCV's are covered by this final rule, it is because of section 4006. This section
is also the reason that vehicles are listed in appendix C for Alaska. Thus, vehicles not previously considered LCV's
are included in this final rule, because the statute applies to more than just LCV's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA expressed concern that the FHWA's attempt to organize the vehicles subject to the freeze into four basic categories
requires the FHWA to go beyond the role established for it in the ISTEA. The ATA contends that the ISTEA limits the role
of the Secretary to reviewing for accuracy and publishing State information and that the categorization made by the
FHWA involves the interpretation of State laws and regulations. Similarly, Alaska commented that the nomenclature
used in designating the four basic categories ``is not universally acceptable.'' The categories used in appendix
C, as included in the SNPRM, were (1) Rocky Mountain Doubles, (2) Turnpike Doubles, (3) Triples, and (4) Other. These
names were chosen in an attempt to describe the vehicles covered by the freeze in terms commonly used in the trucking
industry. Since there is no industry-wide or statutory definition for categories 1, 2, or 3, a degree of confusion
remained as to just what vehicle combinations were covered, especially by categories 1 and 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA required the FHWA to list vehicles by ``configuration type'' (section 1023) or ``specific configuration''
(section 4006). In creating the basic configuration categories used in the NPRM and SNPRM, the FHWA believed it had
to go beyond just publishing State-submitted information. For example, many States do not differentiate between
a ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Double in the statutes or regulations which authorize their operation. Typically,
these States allow a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer, or a truck tractor and two trailing units where each trailing
unit can be up to some maximum length. Interpretations were required to develop the maximum parameters that would
apply if the State did differentiate by vehicle type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has re-examined the meaning of ``configuration,'' however, and determined that there is no statutory requirement
to classify vehicle combinations according to industry usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to reduce confusion and simplify the description of vehicles covered by the freeze, the vehicles described
in appendix C of this final rule have therefore been regrouped into three categories: (1) Truck tractor and two trailing
units, (2) Truck tractor and three trailing units, and (3) Other. This preserves the freeze required by the ISTEA without
limiting the discretion allowed by some States before June 1, 1991.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing the March 20, 1992, NPRM and the February 25, 1993, SNPRM, the FHWA decided not to include certain vehicle
combinations submitted by the States, which it determined Congress did not intend to include in the ISTEA freeze.
No additional information regarding conditions, routes, or authority to operate these vehicles was required. In
addition to describing the categories of vehicles proposed for exemption, a detailed listing by State of the vehicles
submitted but exempted was contained in the SNPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments, the ATA urged the FHWA to include in the regulatory language of the final rule the list of exempted vehicles
included in the preamble to the SNPRM. The basis for the ATA's suggestion was ``to ensure that only the vehicles intended
by Congress are restricted and to help clarify the intent of the restriction for enforcement and judicial purposes.''
The ATA's proposal was to include the list of excepted vehicles in an expanded definition of LCV in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The categories of multiple cargo unit vehicles exempted from coverage by the freeze include: (1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer
and truck tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations with a maximum length of the individual cargo units of
28.5 feet or less, (2) conventional automobile and boat transporters with an overall length of 65 feet or less, (3)
stinger-steered automobile and boat transporters with an overall length of 75 feet or less, (4) truck-trailer and
truck-semitrailer combinations with an overall length of 65 feet or less, (5) maxi-cubes, (6) most tow trucks with
vehicles in tow, and (7) combination vehicles which include a truck tractor containing a dromedary box, deck, or plate,
and one semitrailer or trailer. With respect to the dromedary equipped vehicle exclusion, strict interpretation
of ISTEA section 4006 would include this equipment under the freeze. By its function, a dromedary box, deck, or plate
is a cargo-carrying unit. When combined with a semitrailer, the result is technically a combination with two cargo-carrying
units, thus subjecting the combination to the freeze. However, dromedary equipped truck tractors in actual operation
on December 1, 1982, are grandfathered under &sect;658.13(f), causing a combination consisting of one of these units
and a semitrailer to be considered as simply a truck tractor-semitrailer under the provisions of part 658. Dromedary
equipped semitrailer combinations are a minor segment of the industry which probably escaped the notice of Congress,
and which would require a good deal of additional time and effort to list. Should States or carriers try to evade the
ISTEA freeze mandate by expanding the size of these unlisted combinations, the FHWA may have to initiate rulemaking
to close this loophole.

The exclusion information is codified by this final rule at &sect;658.23(b)(1) through (b)(5). The list of exempted
vehicles by State included in the SNPRM has not been codified, however, because of the likelihood that it is not a complete
list. The original instruction to the States about these vehicles was to submit anything they thought might be covered
by the freeze. Since the effect of ATA's comment would be to exempt only those vehicle combinations listed, some States
could be penalized in terms of allowing certain vehicles simply because they reviewed the guidelines and made a decision
that certain vehicles were not involved in the freeze coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of LCV used throughout this proceeding is that established in the ISTEA. In the interest of avoiding

Under the terms of ISTEA section 1023, an LCV may continue to operate only if on or before June 1, 1991, the specific configuration
was (1) legally allowed in the State and (2) was in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis. Under section
4006, the overall length of two or more cargo-carrying units used in a specific configuration may not exceed the length
allowed by State law, and in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis, on or before June 1, 1991. If a specific
multi-trailer configuration was authorized by State statute or regulation, but

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the vehicles listed in appendix C meet the requirements for continued operation set forth in ISTEA sections
1023 and 4006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information on these vehicles which the States supplied in response to the ISTEA, the March 20, 1992, NPRM and the
February 25, 1993, SNPRM, satisfies the legal requirement for operation, i.e., authorized by State law. In a similar
manner, various commenters, responding to a request contained in the SNPRM, have documented the actual operation
on a regular or periodic basis of the vehicle combinations listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNPRM requested information, from any source, to show the actual operation of vehicles described in appendix
C. While a copy of the special permit under which operations occurred was listed as the preferred means of satisfying
the documentation requirement, any item which could support operation of these vehicles would be considered as acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an early response to the docket, the ATA expressed concern that the FHWA was placing a ``tremendous burden on State
DOT's and the trucking industry to satisfy a totally new requirement in a very short time period.'' The SNPRM allowed
for a 45-day comment period with April 12, 1993, as the docket closing date. The ATA also stated that ``(i)t is unlikely
that two year old copies of the actual permit will be available,'' and that working with the permit issuing offices
in each State to locate these records would ``no doubt be a very time consuming and cumbersome process.'' As an alternative,
the ATA suggested that the FHWA allow the submission of an affidavit from a carrier and/or State agency to satisfy the
documentation requirement, and further that a time extension be granted to allow appropriate review and certification
of these documents, if allowed. A request for a time extension for the docket was also received from the WTA and Coastal
Chem Sales Company of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The need to accurately comply with the actual operation documentation requirement
was given as the reason for the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments, the CRASH stated that the proof requirement contained in the SNPRM was ``far too broad, and (could)
easily lead to mistake or fraud.'' That organization argued that anything less than ``verifiable documentary evidence
created and dated on or before June 1, 1991, specifically detailing the vehicle length, weight, configuration and
routes traveled'' would fail to comply with ISTEA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the time extension requests, the FHWA agreed that more time was needed to help assure that accurate and
complete documentation information, including affidavits, was submitted to the docket. On April 14, 1993, a 45-day
extension of the comment period, to May 27, 1993, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 19367. The type of information the CRASH argued the FHWA should require appears to exceed the documentation
most States demand of LCV operators. It would distort the purpose of the ISTEA freeze to ban certain vehicles or routes
simply because the States lacked the foresight to issue permits that met the maximum possible data requirements of
a Federal law not yet enacted.

An affidavit made by an individual familiar with the issue at hand is both reasonable and within the documentation
parameters established by the SNPRM. The authenticity of any document proposed as evidence to support activity occurring
over 21/2 years ago could be challenged by any party. Of the possible items of documentation which could be submitted,
a notarized affidavit may be the least susceptible to alteration. It represents an individual's witnessed, sworn
statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An affidavit could, of course, be fraudulent, and the FHWA would be reluctant to take regulatory action based solely
on an affidavit without other support. In fact, however, affidavits are merely one kind of information which the FHWA
has combined with other types of documentation to demonstrate the operation of vehicles that State law and/or regulation
allows. In addition, section 1023(c) of the ISTEA amended 23 U.S.C. 141(b) by adding at the end the following sentence:
``Each State shall also certify that it is enforcing and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
complying with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the provisions of section 127(d) of this title and section 411(j) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of
1982 (49 U.S.C. App. 2311(j))'' (emphasis added). Additional discussion of the certification change is contained
elsewhere in this document. However, for this discussion the statement means that if a State is found not to be complying
with the ISTEA LCV requirements, it will be subject to Federal-aid highway funding sanctions involving millions
of dollars annually.

Two permits were issued by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for ``Triples'' at the request
of the California legislature in 1971 in order to conduct a test to evaluate the possible allowance of ``Triples''
in California. In 1983, permits were issued to allow the operation of the above described vehicle combinations in
order to conduct an over the road test of these vehicles. The State, in its comments, points out that the 1983 tests were
conducted, in part, to assist the FHWA in its study of the costs and benefits of a national intercity LCV route network.

Based on these two occurrences, California claims the right to issue permits for good cause for the future operation
of these vehicles up to the limits stated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has rejected California's claim because it fails to meet the standard for ``regular or periodic'' use established
by Congress in writing the ISTEA. According to the Conference Report on the ISTEA (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong.,
1st Sess. 314 (1991)), ``Use of an LCV on only one or two occasions pursuant to a special permit would not provide a basis
for satisfactorily certifying grandfather rights or operations under this subsection.'' Clearly the California
situation falls within the scope of the congressional guidance. ``Triples'' were allowed twice, for very brief periods
12 years apart, the last being more than 10 years ago. ``Turnpike Doubles'' and ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' were authorized
only once, over 10 years ago, during a single 5-day period. These occurrences do not constitute ``regular or periodic''
use.

No documentation was received in the docket to support the actual operation of this vehicle on or before June 1, 1991.
This vehicle was originally included because it appeared to meet the LCV or extra-length multi-unit commercial vehicle
requirements. This vehicle is made up of a truck tractor and a dolly unit. Since the weight of a cargo, for example utility
poles, is carried partially by the truck tractor and partially by the dolly unit, the argument might be made that this
vehicle has two cargo-carrying units.

4 feet for interunit spacing to the twin 29-foot dimension. Due to the de-listing of a vehicle combination with twin

No documentation was received in the docket to support the actual operation of this vehicle on or before June 1, 1991.
The initial submission by New Hampshire, to satisfy the LCV freeze requirements, indicated the listed combination
was allowed because State law does not prohibit a straight truck of up to 40 feet long from pulling a trailer that may
be up to 48 feet long. Due to the de-listing of the described vehicle combination, the maximum cargo-carrying length
of any truck-trailer combination on NN highways reverts to 58 feet. This length is derived by subtracting 7 feet for
the cab from the 65-foot overall length for this combination allowed by this rule without a requirement to document
actual operations. Off the NN, the maximum lengths allowed by State law continue to apply.

List of ISTEA Vehicle Operations and Conditions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the lists of vehicle configurations, the ISTEA also required each State to submit a copy of all its statutes,
regulations, limitations, and conditions which apply to the operation of each of the LCV's or extra-length vehicles
reported as in use on or before June 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The content of the States' original responses to this request covered the full range of what could be supplied, both
in terms of items covered and volume of material. The diversity of the contents of the responses was so great that the
FHWA determined that before any list could be finalized, increased uniformity would be necessary. One of the subheadings
for each LCV or extra-length vehicle described in the NPRM was ``Operational Conditions.'' The information in the
NPRM was taken directly from the initial State responses to the LCV information request contained in the ISTEA, regardless
of content. In those cases where another document was referenced, the FHWA attempted to summarize that document.
Because of the differences in State-provided responses, there was little consistency as to coverage or depth. Therefore,
in addition to asking for comments, the NPRM also asked the States and all other sources, including industry trade

The State DOT commented that the weight restriction discussion in the SNPRM for Alaska should not apply because the
section 1023 freeze applies only to the Interstate System, and Alaska does not have Interstate System mileage designated
under 23 U.S.C. 103, 139(a), or 139(b). The FHWA agrees with this comment. Accordingly, the weight condition for each
vehicle described has been revised to indicate that a carrier has to be in compliance with State laws and regulations
and does not list maximum weight limit values. In addition, because LCV's, as defined in the ISTEA, do not operate in
Alaska due to the lack of Interstate System mileage, the ``LCV'' notation previously included by the combination
description has been removed.

The CRASH stated that Alaska Administrative Permit Manual Section 11.6 provides that ``all oversize or overweight
vehicles not in convoy shall maintain a minimum distance of 800 to 1,500 feet from any other oversize vehicle or vehicle
with load and pilot car traveling in the same direction on the same highway in rural areas.'' Since Alaska is not contiguous
to any other State this type of information would be of little use to any out-of-State trucker. Any vehicle requiring
a permit would be subject to the Alaska permit rules which would be given to the driver when the permit was obtained.
Therefore, in view of its limited usefulness in terms of general information, we will not add this provision to appendix
C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4006(a) of the ISTEA provides that Alaska ``may allow operation of commercial motor vehicle combinations
which were not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but which were in actual operation prior to July 6, 1991.'' Verification
has been furnished that ``Triples'' with trailers not over 45 feet in length were in actual operation under permit
prior to July 6, 1991. The CRASH believes that the operation of ``Triples'' after June 1, 1991, was authorized only
on an experimental basis as provided in 17 AAC 25.106(b)(4). However, the ISTEA allows the continued operation of
any combinations put into service between June 2 and July 5, 1991, without further condition. Therefore, ``Triples''
may continue to operate, as indicated in appendix C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State advised that under Alaska regulations, a truck tractor equipped with a dromedary box is defined as not being
cargo carrying. Dromedary boxes do in fact carry cargo. However, for the reasons given above, the FHWA has decided
for the time being not to list the cargo-carrying length of dromedary tractor-semitrailer combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State indicated that an additional route, AK&hyph;1 from Palmer-Wasilla Highway Junction to Wishbone Hill Coal
Access Road, must be added to Alaska's routes chart under the caption for ``Rocky Mountain Double-LCV'' (58 FR 11467)
of the SNPRM. However, this is incorrect because the freeze on vehicle length is applicable only on the NN, and this
is not an NN route. The State is free to regulate the size and weight of vehicles off the NN as it sees fit.

The CRASH stated that Arizona statute ARS 28&hyph;1011.N should not be shown as authority for permitting overweight
vehicles on the NN since it only covers the issuance of permits on other than NN routes. We agree, since the provisions
of Section 4006 of the ISTEA apply only to vehicles on the NN. Therefore, ARS 28&hyph;1011.N has been deleted from the
``Legal Citations'' for Arizona in appendix C.

The CRASH stated that the legal size for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' is 90 feet, and not 92 feet as shown in proposed appendix
C contained in the SNPRM. Arizona statute ARS 28&hyph;1011.A provides that the Arizona DOT may issue oversize permits
for vehicles exceeding otherwise applicable length limits on the State highway system. Further, the change in categories
from those listed in the SNPRM makes this a moot point insofar as the final appendix C is concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH stated that the State may not issue ``verbal policy directives'' authorizing overlength vehicles. It adds
that the State appears to be violating its own statutes. The question cannot be resolved in this proceeding but the
FHWA will investigate the issue in connection with Arizona's certification of compliance with 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH also stated that weight limits for LCV's on US 89A and I&hyph;15 cannot be determined under ARS 28&hyph;1011.N.
The FHWA agrees. Since the ISTEA freezes the weight of LCV's only on the Interstate System, we will not further consider
weight limits on US 89A. The State indicated that the maximum allowable weight limits for all LCV's on the Interstate
System is 111,000 pounds, except for ``Triples,'' which it said are subject to a maximum allowable weight of 123,500
pounds. The 111,000-pound maximum weight limits are specifically authorized under ARS 28&hyph;1011.M, and higher
maximum weights may be authorized under ARS 28&hyph;1011.A on the State highway system. Since the State indicated
that the highest weight authorized for ``Triples'' on or before June 1, 1991, was 123,500 pounds, that value is retained
in appendix C.

Appendix C in the SNPRM showed the cargo-carrying length for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' in Colorado as 85 feet, for
``Turnpike Doubles'' 95 feet, for ``Triples'' 95 feet, and for truck-trailer combinations as 78 feet. However, on
June 1, 1991, the State actually allowed one of the trailing units in ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' to be up to 48 feet long
and the other up to 28 feet 6 inches long, with not over 15 feet of hitch between the two units, or a total cargo-carrying
length of 91.5 feet. The State also allowed ``Turnpike Doubles'' to have two trailers of approximately equal length,
not to exceed 48 feet each, with a hitch not to exceed 15 feet in length. The resulting cargo-carrying length becomes
111 feet. Revised appendix C has been changed to reflect these values.

42&hyph;4&hyph;409(11)(a)(II)(A), (B), or (C), and comply with Rule 4&hyph;15 in the rules pertaining to Extra-Legal
Vehicles or Loads.'' The State also commented that the time restrictions on the operation of ``Rocky Mountain Doubles''
in the next sentence should be changed from 7 a.m. to 6 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 3 p.m. and that the sentence in parentheses
should read as follows: ``('Rocky Mountain' doubles not operating at greater than the legal maximum weight of 80,000
pounds are subject to different hours of operation restrictions. Refer to rules pertaining to the Operation of Longer
Vehicle Combinations on Designated State Highway Segments).'' The CRASH said motor carriers that operate ISTEA
vehicles must have an established safety program as provided in Chapter 9 of the Colorado Department of Highways Rules
and Regulations for Operation of Longer Vehicle Combinations on Designated State Highway Segments. Elements of
the program include compliance with minimum safety standards at 8 CCR 1507&hyph;1; hazardous materials regulations
at 8 CCR 1507&hyph;7, 8, and 9; Colorado Uniform Motor Vehicle Law, Articles 1 through 4 of Title 42, C.R.S., as amended;
and Public Utility Commission's regulations at 4 CCR 723&hyph;6, 8, 15, 22, and 23. Revised appendix C includes these

Vehicles or Load Rules. However, when the rules address the same subject, the LVC, since it is operating at greater
than 80,000 pounds, must comply with the Extra-Legal Vehicles or Loads Rules. Such rules are: 4&hyph;1&hyph;2 and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State pointed out that no maximum gross weight is shown in connection with the truck-trailer combination listed
in appendix C. This is correct because a truck-trailer combination is not an LCV as defined in the ISTEA since it is not
a combination of a truck tractor and two or more trailers or semitrailers. Therefore, its maximum weight on the Interstates
is not frozen as of June 1, 1991, but remains as provided in 23 U.S.C. 127(a). The listing for this combination has been
changed in appendix C by adding ``WEIGHT'' as a separate category under ``Operational Conditions'' and indicating
that the vehicle must be in compliance with State laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also noted that ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' could operate from milepoint 8.9 to milepoint 9.7 on State Highway
133 in Delta. However, as this is not on the Interstate System or the NN, the ISTEA freeze provisions do not apply. Accordingly,
the route is not listed in the vehicle descriptions. The CRASH said that prior to June 1, 1991, ``Rocky Mountain Doubles''
could operate on I&hyph;70 from the Utah State Line only to State Highway 65 (Exit 49). In fact, the route was extended
from State Highway 65 to State Highway 13 (Exit 90) on April 5, 1990. Since this was prior to June 1, 1991, ``Rocky Mountain
Doubles'' may continue to operate from the Utah State Line to State Highway 13 (Exit 90) after that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also commented that the freeze on the operation of LCV's on the Interstate System and the freeze on the operation
of CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN may create administrative and enforcement problems. However,
it also recognized that this arises from the ISTEA and cannot be changed in this proceeding.

Florida commented that the 106-foot length previously given for ``Turnpike Doubles,'' now shown for a truck tractor
and two trailing unit combination, is incorrect. The maximum length should be 116 feet. The 116-foot dimension is
the maximum overall vehicle length established by State regulation. Appendix C is a listing which includes maximum
cargo-carrying length. The convention used throughout this rulemaking is that, in the absence of any information
to the contrary, cargo-carrying length for a truck tractor combination is the maximum overall length minus 10 feet.
Thus, 106 feet remains the cargo-carrying length value for Florida's truck tractor and two trailing unit combination.

The State also expressed concern over the fact that the vehicles listed for Florida are not considered LCV's as provided
in the ISTEA definition, because the route on which they operate, Florida's Turnpike, is not part of the Interstate
System. The State made the point that the twin-trailer combinations which operate on the Florida Turnpike match the
configuration and weight criteria for LCV's, and only an administrative action, whether or not the Turnpike is part
of the Interstate System, keeps them from being designated as such.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until the ISTEA was enacted, the meaning of the term LCV differed from one region to another, and sometimes depended
on the commodity being transported. By providing a definition of LCV, Congress has provided a basis for describing
these combinations on a national basis. Any combination which does not meet all of the criteria, including operation
on the Interstate System, is not to be considered an LCV.

The CRASH stated that the SNPRM omitted the provisions for time-of-travel restrictions for overlegal loads published
in Idaho Transportation Department Rule 39.C.11.5, and the requirement that an applicant for a permit certify that
the load is indivisible. These restrictions apply only to nondivisible loads as indicated in Rule 39.C.11.4.c. There
are no time-of-day restrictions for Extra-Length Vehicle Combinations operating under permits issued pursuant
to Rule 39.C.22. The CRASH also indicated that time-of-travel restrictions applied to overweight loads under Rule
39.C.11.5. Although the rule is entitled ``Time of Travel Restrictions for Overlegal Loads,'' the text deals only
with ``oversize'' loads. The CRASH said that the SNPRM omitted seasonal weight limits in Rule 39.C.14. The Rule simply
provides that such limits will be posted. Therefore, they are in the same category as speed limits or other general
restrictions that all vehicles must observe.

The ``Dromedary tractor semitrailer'' combination listed in the SNPRM has been removed from appendix C due to the

combination has also been removed from appendix C due to the dromedary equipment exclusion. This vehicle is covered
by the listing for the truck tractor and two trailing unit LCV's.

I&hyph;70 in Western Kansas: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kansas allows SVC's on the short segment of I&hyph;70 from Goodland to the Colorado State line. Kansas submitted this
information and it was published in the NPRM. The FHWA subsequently learned that SVC operations began on that route
only on May 31, 1991, the day before the June 1 freeze date.

The ISTEA provides that LCV's (including SVC's) must have operated ``on a regular or periodic basis'' on or before
June 1, 1991 (23 U.S.C. 127(d)(1)(A)). According to the ISTEA conference report:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To be considered ``regular or periodic'' use, operations must have occurred at recurring intervals over a period
of time. Moreover, periodic operations must have occurred on an intermittent but consistent basis. Use of an LCV on
only one or two occasions pursuant to a special permit would not provide a basis for satisfactorily certifying grandfather
rights or operations *&blank;*&blank;* . (H.R. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., at 314 (1991))

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because SVC operations on I&hyph;70 did not appear to be ``regular or periodic'' by this standard, the FHWA revised
the SNPRM to remove the Goodland segment from the list of authorized Kansas LCV routes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Thirty-seven commenters discussed this subject, and all of them favored restoration of the I&hyph;70 route. Yellow
Corporation, the parent company of Yellow Freight, explained in detail how the problem arose. Yellow Freight uses
a hub and spoke system. The company commented that ``(w)here distances between hubs do not allow for the journey to
be made within the ten-hour federal drivers hours of service limit, Yellow Freight has established driver relay facilities
(where) *&blank;*&blank;* drivers *&blank;*&blank;* are changed, with the equipment moving on to meet customer
service demands.'' Yellow Freight has for 25 years maintained a driver relay facility at Goodland which serves vehicles
moving between its Kansas City and Denver hubs. ``Linehaul drivers leave Kansas City westbound to Goodland, layover
and return eastbound the next day. Goodland-domiciled linehaul drivers operate a turn between Goodland and the Denver
hub.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado authorized triple-trailer and other large combinations in 1989. Unlike competitors with facilities in
eastern Colorado, Yellow Freight was unable to use these vehicles between Goodland and Denver because Kansas did
not allow them on I&hyph;70. Rather than move its relay facility into Colorado or forgo the economic advantages of
``Triples,'' Yellow Freight asked Kansas in September 1989, to allow SVC's on
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
I&hyph;70 between Goodland and the Colorado line. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) announced a rulemaking
proposal in January 1990, that would have allowed ``Triples'' on all Kansas Interstates. The Kansas Railroad Association
(KRA) responded by having a bill to ban ``Triples'' introduced in the legislature; the KDOT withdrew its proposal.
Yellow Freight and the KRA negotiated a compromise which, among other things, allowed triple-trailer combinations
on the Goodland segment of I&hyph;70. The bill was approved on April 12, 1990, and SVC regulations to implement it were
promulgated on March 4, 1991. Yellow Freight ran one ``Triple'' on May 31, 1991, and a second on June 1.

I&hyph;70 operations on the FHWA's failure to clarify its position on the State's grandfather rights in a timely fashion.
The FHWA and a number of States_not including Kansas_had long disagreed on the question of whether LCV operations
were legitimately grandfathered. One of the purposes of the LCV freeze was to resolve these disputes by ratifying
actual operations allowed by State law on June 1, 1991. The KDOT's announced intention to allow SVC's on I&hyph;70
was one more indication of the rapid spread of LCV's in States west of the Mississippi. Because of the desirability
of a uniform policy toward all States that allowed LCV operations, the FHWA did not immediately address the question
of Kansas' grandfather rights. However, on April 8, 1991, just over a month after the KDOT's regulations authorizing
SVC permits became effective, the FHWA asked for an opinion by the Kansas Attorney General (AG). The KDOT requested
the opinion on April 26, 1991, and the AG replied on May 30, 1991, that the State's grandfather rights were broad enough
to encompass SVC operations on I&hyph;70. Since the issue here is ``regular or periodic'' operations, it would serve
no purpose to discuss the AG's grandfather claims. The KDOT quickly issued an annual SVC permit to Yellow Freight and
operations began the following day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's regulatory process was not completed until March 4, 1991, and the Kansas AG required more than a month to
respond to the KDOT's request for an opinion. The FHWA had no part in these delays. It is true, however, that the KDOT
made a good faith effort to satisfy the FHWA's legal concerns and postponed the start of SVC operations on I&hyph;70
until the deadline included in the draft ISTEA legislation had nearly passed. We do not wish to penalize Kansas simply
for cooperating with the FHWA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Yellow Freight asserted that ``(a)s originally drafted, the Federal LCV freeze date would have been April 1, 1991.
Senator Dole's office intervened to move that federal freeze date to June 1, 1991, specifically to accommodate the
Goodland triples route.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA was deeply involved in the Congressional deliberations leading to the LCV freeze. It is our understanding that
the language in the Conference report was designed to preclude establishing LCV operations based on single trip permits
for infrequent truck movements. Therefore one or two movements of heavy machinery by a specialized carrier would
not create ``grandfathered rights.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ATA understands that for Kansas, a single trip permit would normally be issued for ``occasional use'' purposes. It
is clear that the intent of the (SVC) permit was for multiple trip purposes and not occasional ``one or two trips.''
The permit had been applied for long before the freeze language was proposed. It was only a matter of timing that so few
trips were made.

There is nothing in the ISTEA legislative history that clarifies the meaning of ``regular or periodic basis,'' but
the ATA's interpretation is plausible, especially in view of the Caltrans' response to the SNPRM. The Caltrans stated
that it

[I]ssued two permits, at the request of the California Legislature, allowing two vehicle combinations with three
26.5-foot trailers to operate from October 27 to November 5, 1971. These vehicle combinations had an overall length
of 94.25 feet with gross vehicle weights of 76,800 pounds and 90,000 pounds. The 1971 permits were issued to gather
information on truck tractor and triple trailer combination operations. The information was used to consider whether
triple combination operations should be allowed in California.

In 1983, the Caltrans issued permits for operational tests of (1) a 111,000-pound ``Triple'' (28-foot trailers)
between October 24&hyph;28; (2) a 106,850-pound ``Rocky Mountain Double'' (48-foot semitrailer, 28-foot pup)
between November 7&hyph;10; and (3) a 122,650-pound ``Turnpike Double'' (two 48-foot trailers) between November

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The brief tests performed by California one and two decades ago, which never resulted in the authorization of LCV's,
are certainly among the minimal operations that the requirement for ``regular or periodic'' use was intended to exclude.
The FHWA has therefore declined to list these vehicles in appendix C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kansas and Yellow Freight, on the other hand, clearly expected LCV's to use I&hyph;70 routinely and for years to come,
and made elaborate preparations on that basis. In addition, the KDOT's efforts to cooperate with the FHWA delayed
the issuance of the first permits, which would otherwise have been available in March 1991. On balance, the FHWA believes
that the SVC operations on I&hyph;70 satisfy the statutory standard. The Goodland route has therefore been restored
to appendix C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH commented on the accuracy of the lists of routes available to the different vehicle combinations. Appendix
C now reflects the proper route listings. Due to the SVC and Turnpike operations, the truck tractor and three trailing
unit combination does have more route mileage available to it than do two trailing unit combinations. The new route
lists show that I&hyph;70 between the Colorado State Line and Goodland is available only to SVC's with three trailing
units and not to LCV combinations with two trailing units.

The State commented that the vehicle in question is a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer where one of the cargo units

of the first trailer to the rear of the second trailer, of 58 feet, including the load. This vehicle configuration was
excluded from the original listing of LCV's in the NPRM. The exclusion was based on a definition of excepted combination
used in the NPRM (57 FR 9901, March 20, 1992) as follows:

 configurations with a maximum length of cargo-carrying units of 62 feet or less are subject to the provisions of 23

Michigan contends that the vehicle was correctly excepted in the NPRM since the Michigan vehicle clearly fell within
the length parameters of non-LCV vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion by the FHWA in the NPRM was erroneous. The vehicle was included in the SNPRM and is now in the final rule
since it can consist of a truck tractor and two trailing units and can carry more than 80,000 pounds on the Interstate
System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also commented that the ``Rocky Mountain Double_LCV'' description in the SNPRM was inappropriate for the

The State commented that the table listing vehicle combinations subject to the ISTEA, illustrating a Michigan vehicle
listed under ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' with a 128,000-pound maximum gross weight, was inappropriate. Michigan,
the State argued, is an axle weight State with a grandfather provision and maximum gross weights are determined based
on axle and axle group weight limits. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to specify a single maximum gross weight
for Michigan. The FHWA does not agree. The table and text have been revised to show a maximum allowable gross weight
of 154,000 pounds. The 154,000-pound figure was determined from the maximum axle weight limits for an 11-axle vehicle
(the maximum number of axles allowed under State law) with optimum axle spacing and with a combined cargo-carrying
box length of 58 feet. Vehicles with fewer axles or less than optimum axle spacing will have a lower allowable gross
weight based on State requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CRASH claimed that an error in available routes had been made in the SNPRM, and that the SNPRM did not include several
items that pertain to permitted loads. The CRASH not only questioned the availability of several Interstate routes
in the Kansas City metropolitan area, but also the availability of I&hyph;44 in southwest Missouri. It stated that
``the only National Network route from which LCV's can enter Missouri is I&hyph;70 in Kansas.'' Several NN routes
in Kansas and Oklahoma come up to the Missouri State Line. LCV's are allowed to operate on I&hyph;44 in Oklahoma, thus
making I&hyph;44 available to enter Missouri. In Kansas, LCV's have access to the northeastern end of the Kansas Turnpike,
over any route within a 20-mile radius. Within that 20-mile radius in Kansas, several Interstate and other highways,
which prior to passage of the ISTEA were designated as Federal-aid Primary highways, come up to the Missouri State
Line. LCV's may use any of these routes to reach terminals in Missouri which fall within a 20-mile band of the Kansas
State Line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRASH indicated that the State indivisible load requirement had been omitted from the SNPRM. In addition, the
CRASH contends that several operational requirements were also omitted, including those involving time-of-day
restrictions, weather requirements, oversize load signs, speed, tractor unit power, and the need for insurance.
The State responded that routine overdimension and overweight special permit issuance in Missouri is made in accordance
with State Rule 7 CSR 10&hyph;2.010 (based on Section 304.200, Revised Statutes of Missouri 1992), which provides
for a uniform administration of large and heavy loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rule (7 CSR 10&hyph;2.010) as originally promulgated by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission
disallows routing reducible loads (except for farm products) under permit, in July 1986 the State's chief engineer,
exercising other authority within the rule, authorized travel for multi-unit LCV's carrying reducible loads. To
quote Rule 7 CSR 10&hyph;2.010:

It was determined to be in the public interest to allow LCV operation to relieve economic stress and give motor carriers
the incentive to retain terminals in Missouri. Missouri would then be more competitive with adjacent western States
which allow LCV operations. The operation of LCV's has gone without reported incident, according to annual documented
safety assessments made by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, the Missouri State Highway Patrol,
the Kansas City Public Works Department, and the Kansas City Police Department.

In response to other items listed, the State made the point that Missouri Revised Statute &sect;304.200 (1992) gives
the chief engineer significant latitude in allowing the operation of LCV's, and that several items including speed
and weather restrictions are conditions of the permit issued for the operation of LCV's.

61&hyph;10&hyph;124, increased the length of Turnpike Doubles from 95 to 100 feet in length effective January 1,
1992, and, therefore, the cargo-carrying length in appendix C should be based on the shorter length. This is incorrect.

The cargo-carrying length restriction does not apply to two trailing unit combinations. The length of each trailing
unit is limited to 28.5 feet. This describes a two trailing unit vehicle whose operation is guaranteed by the STAA regardless
of inter-unit spacing. As long as each trailing unit is 28.5 feet long or less, cargo-carrying length is not restricted.
This combination is listed as an LCV because it can exceed the 80,000-pound threshold established in the congressional
definition. New Mexico has a grandfathered gross weight limit of 86,400 pounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cargo-carrying unit length for the two trailing unit combination has been listed in this final rule at 110 feet.
This length was determined after further review of docket comments submitted by the CRASH, actual operation documentation
submitted by various carriers, and the appropriate State statutes and regulations. The composite of the information
available leads the FHWA to conclude that on or before June 1, 1991, the longest legally allowed multi-unit combination
vehicle in regular or periodic use in the State consisted of a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer, wherein each of
the trailing units was 53 feet long. Combining twin 53-foot units with a 4-foot drawbar results in the 110-foot cargo-carrying
length. In the NPRM the cargo-carrying length listed for both the ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Doubles was
123 feet. In the SNPRM, 123 feet was again listed for the ``Turnpike'' Double. The 123-foot distance was the result
of combining a 4-foot drawbar with twin 59-foot 6-inch units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of establishing a cargo-carrying length subject to the freeze provisions of the ISTEA, the State incorrectly
interpreted relevant provisions of the STAA of 1982. It appears the State reasoned that since the STAA required (1)
that all States allow truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer ``Doubles'' combinations, and (2) that Oklahoma must
allow a 59-foot 6-inch semitrailer to meet the grandfather provisions of the STAA (53 FR 2599, Jan. 29, 1988), it follows
that Oklahoma must therefore allow twin 59-foot 6-inch units to operate as part of a multi-unit combination vehicle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the STAA does require all States to allow ``Doubles,'' the only applicable length requirement is that each State
must allow at least 28.5-foot trailing units. The allowance of any longer unit is at a State's discretion within the
parameters established by this final rule. The grandfathered semitrailer length applies only for truck tractor-semitrailer
combinations. The STAA requires that each State continue to allow trailers or semitrailers of such dimensions as
those that were in actual and lawful use in the State on December 1, 1982. The January 1988 rulemaking referred to earlier
established that length as 59 feet 6 inches for Oklahoma.

For purposes of establishing a cargo-carrying length subject to the freeze provisions of the ISTEA, a determination
must be made as to the unit lengths comprising combination vehicles authorized by State statute or regulation and
in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis on or before June 1, 1991. Re-examination of all submitted material
and docket comments resulted in the 110-foot length.

The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) commented that overall length requirements for three trailing unit
combinations have a significant impact on public safety and must be retained. The ODOT also said that the length of
tractors in combination with three trailing units is not a uniform 10 feet long but can range from 9 to 14 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The freeze does not affect the authority of the ODOT to enforce an overall length limit on triple-trailer combinations.
However, it does limit the overall length of the cargo-carrying units to what was authorized and in use on or before
June 1, 1991. Although the comment does not specifically indicate that 9-foot-long tractors were in use with ``Triples''
on or before June 1, 1991, we assume that was the intent. Therefore, appendix C has been changed to correct the cargo-carrying
length of three trailing unit combinations from 95 to 96 feet.

The CRASH commented that ORS 818.150(5) provides that any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety
chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables
must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached
with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel
coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated. Appendix
C has been amended accordingly.

The ODOT indicated that there is no direct relationship between approved routes for three trailing unit combinations
and the NN highways. The connection is that the freeze applies only on NN highways. Consequently, truck tractor and
three trailing unit combinations may not operate with more than 96 feet of cargo-carrying length on routes shown in
appendix C. The State is free to regulate the use of triple-trailer combinations as it sees fit on other highways.

The State said that the maximum weight limit for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' is not ``129K'' as shown on the table at
58 FR 11465&hyph;11466 of the SNPRM but is the ``Uncapped Federal Bridge Formula.'' For LCV's the maximum allowable
weight is capped at what was allowed and in actual operation on June 1, 1991. Based on the information submitted by the
State, a ``Turnpike Double,'' which must also comply with the Federal Bridge formula, is limited to a maximum of 129,000
pounds. The recategorization of the vehicles subject to the LCV freeze has adopted the 129,000-pound value for the
``Turnpike Double'' as the maximum for a truck tractor and two trailing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State showed the length of the road tractor-trailer-trailer combination as 80 feet. However, this is the overall
length. When the length determination in the SNPRM is used, the cargo-carrying length is the overall length minus
10 feet for the length of the tractor. Therefore, the cargo-carrying length of this combination is shown in appendix
C as 70 feet.

This vehicle is therefore covered by the listing for the truck tractor and two trailing unit LCV which also has a cargo-carrying
length of 68 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also commented that the length of the cargo-carrying units for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' should indicate
that the 68-foot length includes the load. We disagree. The ISTEA limited the length of cargo-carrying units, not
loads. If the State wants to prohibit, or allow, cargo overhangs over that length, it is free to do so since it retains
all the authority it possessed prior to the ISTEA to regulate cargo overhangs.

On or before June 1, 1991, Wyoming only allowed combination vehicles consisting of not more than three single vehicles.
This precluded the operation of triple-trailer combinations which consist of four single vehicles_a truck tractor,
a semitrailer, and two trailers. A provision of the ISTEA, in effect, gave the State until the next general election
day following enactment (November 3, 1992) to decide whether to allow ``Triples.'' A Statewide referendum to allow
their use was defeated in the November 3, 1992, election and, as a result, the ISTEA bars the use of ``Triples'' in Wyoming.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions relating to the length of a semitrailer in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination will not be added to
appendix C since this vehicle is not subject to the ISTEA freeze. The State DOT argued that its 60-foot semitrailer
length limit would apply to automobile and boat transporters with no overall length limit. This is not consistent
with the Federal requirement that States must allow standard automobile and boat transporters to have a minimum overall
length of 65 feet (75 feet if stinger-steered), with no specific limit on the length of the semitrailer. However, application
of the State rule does not conflict with the Federal requirement since, as a practical matter, it only applies to vehicles
longer than 65 or 75 feet. Such longer combinations would be subject to the ISTEA freeze. As a result, appendix C has
been changed to list the overall length of auto and boat transporters, since cargo is typically carried on a headrack
the same length as the tractor, in addition to the cargo on the trailer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WTA said that a truck-trailer combination falls under the definition of ``any other combination of vehicles''
in Wyoming law and, therefore, is limited to a total overall length of 85 feet with no single unit exceeding 60 feet.
While the combination is limited to 85 feet, the 60-foot limit applies only to semitrailers in a truck tractor-semitrailer
combination. The showing of 78 feet for the length of the cargo-carrying units was based on allowing 7 feet for cab length.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA said that it could not understand why the cargo-carrying length of saddlemount combinations was shown in the
SNPRM as 75 feet. Under Wyoming law it would be considered as ``any other combination'' subject to an overall length
of 85 feet. We agree. Since the tractor in a saddlemount combination is part of the cargo being transported, we have
changed the length of the cargo-carrying units for this combination to 85 feet.

TOW TRUCK OPERATIONS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nature of the service provided by wreckers or tow trucks is such that these vehicles need to have immediate access
to all roads in a State to remove disabled or abandoned, as well as accident-damaged, vehicles. They are, to that extent,
emergency vehicles. There is no evidence that Congress intended to include these operations under the freeze restrictions.
Therefore, the FHWA proposed in the SNPRM to exclude emergency towing operations from any of the freeze provisions
proposed in appendix C. Comments on this issue were received from the California and Washington DOT's and the California
Highway Patrol.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both of the California agencies recommended that proposed 23 CFR 658.23(b)(5), which would allow tow trucks and vehicles
in tow to operate on the NN without regard to the freeze on length, be amended to require a State permit to operate overlength.
This is unnecessary since 23 CFR 658.23(b)(5) merely means that they are not limited to whatever length was allowed
and in use on June 1, 1991. Since they also are not STAA vehicles, the State may regulate their length in any manner it
sees fit, including the requirement for a permit, if it wishes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Washington DOT asked if tow truck operations are restricted to the length and weight in effect on June 1, 1991. As
stated in the SNPRM, emergency towing operations are excluded from any of the freeze provisions in appendix C. However,
the proposed provisions in paragraph (b) of 23 CFR 658.23 only excluded tow trucks from the length provisions of appendix
C. In order to fully exclude emergency towing operations from any of the provisions contained in new 23 CFR 658.23,
the underlined phrase in paragraph (a)(1) has been added:

Pole Trailers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the SNPRM the FHWA proposed to list, as the authorized length for expandable trailers used for carrying poles, logs
or pipe, etc. (pole trailers), the lengths allowed by State law, even if these limits refer to the cargo rather than
the vehicle itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only five sets of comments were received which specifically addressed the issue of pole trailers. The South Dakota
DOT supported the position that the State-allowed length of the cargo should be considered the cargo-carrying length
of the unit. The State added that the FHWA should establish a national cargo overhang policy similar to that in effect
for automobile and boat transporters; that is, 3 feet in front and 4 feet to the rear of the vehicle. The Pennsylvania
DOT commented that its special length limitation (70 feet) for any combination transporting nondivisible articles
has been in place for over 20 years, and that it should be listed as Pennsylvania's length for these vehicles. The California
Highway Patrol provided that State's applicable length limits for pole or log trailers. Taking a different tack,
both the ATA and the WTA stated in their comments that pole trailers should not be considered or regulated as LCV's.
The ATA stated that the ``FHWA is incorrect in believing that establishing length limits for pole trailers is consistent
with the purpose of section 4006 of ISTEA.'' In addition to echoing the ATA's comment, the WTA went on to state that the
FHWA's proposal with regard to regulating pole trailers as an LCV, ``does not recognize that timber harvesters do
not cut logs in the same lengths all the time. Utility poles transported by telephone and power companies are not the
same length and neither are the joints of pipe used in oil well drilling, pipe line construction and water and sewer
line repair and construction.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has re-examined this issue. In the SNPRM, the FHWA admitted that the statutory language concerning the freeze
is not readily applicable to such vehicles. The discussion of pole trailers and the inclusion of these vehicles in
the SNPRM was based on an interpretation that the two cross-members on which the cargo rests constitute individual
cargo-carrying units for purposes of section 4006 of the ISTEA. That argument is difficult to maintain. In fact, the
hitch, the load, and rear dolly combine to create a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
semitrailer. The FHWA has decided not to include these vehicles in appendix C, as truck tractor-semitrailers are
not subject to the requirements of the freeze. Two separate pole trailers pulled by a tractor, however, must comply
with section 4006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Further Restrictions on ISTEA Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ISTEA provides that States may further restrict, or even prohibit, the operation of LCV's or CMV's with two or more
cargo-carrying units after June 1, 1991. Such restrictions, however, must be consistent with sections 411, 412,
and 416(a) of the STAA. This means that States may not prohibit twin trailer combinations with trailers not over 28
feet long (28.5 feet if grandfathered) from operating on the NN or reasonable access routes. States may not restrict
the width of vehicles on the NN or reasonable access routes to less than 102 inches or the metric equivalent, 102.36
inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State must notify the Secretary within 30 days after the imposition of further restrictions or prohibitions on the
operation of LCV's or CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units. The FHWA does not have approval authority over any
additional restrictions a State may impose, but is required to publish such restrictions in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FHWA may require further information or clarification before publishing the restrictions in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additional comments were received on this issue in response to the SNPRM. The proposed regulatory language in the
SNPRM directly reflected congressional intent as expressed in the ISTEA. That language has been adopted unchanged
by this final rule in &sect;658.23(e).

Minor Adjustments to Listed Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA allow States to make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature which
will relax route designations and vehicle operating restrictions in effect on June 1, 1991. They also direct the Secretary
to issue regulations establishing criteria for the States to follow in making such adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor adjustments must be both temporary and caused by an emergency. According to the Conference Report on the ISTEA
(H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 314 (1991)), such adjustments are intended to be temporary and limited,
e.g., a bridge failure that would require the rerouting of ISTEA vehicles to highways where they would otherwise be
prohibited. Since it is impossible to foresee all types of emergencies that might necessitate a minor adjustment,
and it is not the intent of the FHWA to establish a burdensome reporting requirement, the proposed regulation would
require a State to report the details of an adjustment only if the duration was expected to exceed 30 days. Emergency
adjustments with a duration of 30 days or less would not be reported to the FHWA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to cap the duration of minor adjustments at 1 year. Adjustments lasting more than 1 year would not
be considered to be of a temporary or emergency nature. Minor adjustments for the same emergency would not be permitted
to be broken into periods of less than 1 year to extend the emergency for a period longer than that. Similarly, an emergency
would not be permitted to be broken into 30-day or shorter periods to avoid reporting. The FHWA re-examined the issue
in light of the comments received to the NPRM docket. Subsequently, the SNPRM removed the NPRM's 1-year maximum duration
for a minor adjustment, but clearly spelled out that the FHWA must approve any minor adjustments which exceed 30 days.
The SNPRM proposal also clearly spelled out that rejection of a State's request would cause the immediate reimposition
of freeze restrictions, with failure to do so putting a State at risk of a funding penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two sets of comments to the SNPRM addressed the issue, those of the CRASH and those of the Advocates For Highway and Auto
Safety (Advocates). Both organizations objected to the removal of the original 1-year time limit. They feared that
under the SNPRM States would be allowed to detour LCV's onto highways less capable of safely accommodating these vehicles
for unspecified, indefinite lengths of time. The Advocates also objected to the SNPRM proposal because
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It fails to provide any criteria for the states to use in choosing alternate routes. The agency (FHWA) simply asserts
that it will exercise its discretion to review and approve or disapprove any state's request for an LCV routing adjustment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
It argues that the FHWA is reserving for itself a power to make decisions on an important issue without publicly available
guidelines which have been developed through a rulemaking process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria represented in the final rule by &sect;658.23(c) are necessarily general and rely on the review-and-approval
nature of the Federal-State relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not practical to develop specific criteria to evaluate requests which might originate for any number of reasons.
However, to allay the concerns of both the CRASH and Advocates_that minor adjustments, insofar as alternate routes
are concerned, will result in LCV's temporarily operating on highways perceived to be less safe_this final rule includes
additional guidance in selecting alternate routes. Section 658.23(c) now provides that in selecting alternate
routes, States should, to the extent possible, select routes with geometric and pavement design features equivalent
to those of the highway segment which is temporarily unavailable. In addition, each request involving an alternate
route should include a discussion of what steps the State will take to mitigate any operational and/or safety problems
that may develop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operating philosophy of the FHWA with respect to State issues has always been that of individual office autonomy
within broad national guidelines. The Division Office of Motor Carriers within each State is in the best position
to evaluate requests involving truck issues in the State. However, in order to assure that a degree of uniformity is
applied to such requests, the Regional Office of Motor Carriers must be consulted before a decision is made on a State's
request. On issues which involve alternate routes for LCV's, the final rule directs the Division Office of Motor Carriers
to coordinate with the Division Administrator before consulting with the Regional Office.

Definition of Nondivisible Loads

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of a nondivisible vehicle or load included in the NPRM was criticized by many commenters, and the following
revised definition was therefore proposed in the SNPRM:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nondivisible vehicle or load. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in this part, ``nondivisible'' means any vehicle or load exceeding applicable length or weight limits which
cannot readily be separated into smaller vehicles or loads that comply with such limits without:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compromising the intended use of the vehicle,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Destroying the value of the load, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Using expert knowledge or specially designed tools. The intended use of a vehicle would be compromised if separating
it into smaller units would make it unable to perform the function for which it was designed. The value of a load would
be destroyed if separating it into smaller units would make the load unusable for its intended purpose. Expert knowledge
means familiarity with procedures required to dismantle and reassemble a load which are beyond the job requirements
typically associated with positions in the motor carrier industry. Specially designed tools means equipment designed
and manufactured only for use with the load in question. A State may treat a sealed containerized load moving in international
commerce as a nondivisible load.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of those who responded to the SNPRM discussed nondivisible loads, but a number of comments suggested that the
scope of the definition requires clarification. The definition adopted here (and the others already codified in
23 CFR 658.5) apply, like the ISTEA freeze itself, to the same highways and vehicle characteristics as the underlying
Federal law. The following paragraphs explain that principle in more detail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Weight: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a condition of receiving Federal-aid funds, States are required to enforce Federal weight limits (23 U.S.C. 127)
on the Interstate System and on routes providing reasonable access to and from the Interstate. The penalty for failure
to do so is the withholding of a State's National Highway System (NHS) apportionment. A State may set any weight limit
it wishes on other highways, though many have voluntarily adopted Interstate limits for all roads. States are therefore
required to use the FHWA's definition only when considering whether to issue a nondivisible load permit allowing
an overweight vehicle to operate on the Interstate System and roads providing reasonable access to and from the Interstate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Length: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal laws relating to vehicle length (49 U.S.C. app. 2311 and 23 CFR 658.13, 658.23) apply to the NN of highways_see
appendix A to part 658_and routes providing reasonable access to and from the NN (49 U.S.C. app. 2312 and 23 CFR 658.19).
The Interstate is part of the larger NN, and reasonable access rights extend the reach of Federal size laws beyond the
NN itself. In contrast to Federal weight law, these provisions and the implementing regulations preempt conflicting
State laws or regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a practical matter, the FHWA definition of a nondivisible load will rarely be applied to cargo length because it
does not cover straight trucks or single-trailer combinations. It covers only loads on vehicles (1) operating on
the NN, and routes providing reasonable access to and from the NN, (2) which have two or more cargo-carrying units,
and (3) when the overall length from the front of the first to the rear of the last cargo-carrying unit exceeds the longest
such length in actual legal operation for a specific configuration on or before June 1, 1991. There are very few single
loads that rest simultaneously on the bed of a straight truck and on a trailer, or on two or more trailers. And even in
those cases, the definition would not apply unless the total cargo box length were greater than that allowed by the
State in 1991. The definition will apply more often to loads, like entire buildings, that are moved on a series of dollies,
each of which is a single cargo-carrying unit. There has been virtually no controversy about these loads, and we expect
little in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Width: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal width law (49 U.S.C. app. 2316 and 23 CFR 658.15), like the length requirements, applies on the NN and reasonable
access routes, and it preempts conflicting State laws or regulations. However, the definition of a nondivisible
load adopted by this rule does not apply to an overwidth vehicle because Federal law provides that States may issue
permits to motor vehicles more than 102 inches wide without regard to divisibility or nondivisibility (49 U.S.C.
app. 2316(c)).

The SNPRM proposed to allow States to treat containers moving in international commerce as nondivisible loads. Responses
were about equally divided. Three State transportation departments favored the proposal, while two States, the
ATA, and the Advocates opposed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Missouri said that ``(u)niformity among States to issue overweight permits for containerized loads in excess of
80,000 pounds gross weight would be a giant accomplishment.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connecticut suggested that States be required to treat sealed containerized loads moving in international commerce
as nondivisible, subject to maximum dimensions and weights it did not specify. Florida went even further, pointing
out that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
no justification is presented in the SNPRM for not affording identical containerized loads in domestic commerce
a benefit being afforded such containers in international commerce. Therefore, it is proposed that the final rule
make no reference to either international or domestic commerce and the statement in question should be revised to
read: A State may treat a sealed containerized load as a nondivisible load.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the other hand, the Washington State Patrol strongly disagreed with the proposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If that were allowed, the industry could load any container to whatever weight, claim its (sic) moving in international
commerce and obtain an overweight permit, without regard to axle, gross weight or bridge formula requirements *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a recent ``Container Weight'' study, conducted by the Washington State Patrol, it was shown that of the 3,100
vehicles transporting containers, which exceeded the legal weight limits, all but one could be transported legally
by using vehicles with the proper number of axles and axle spacings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Washington State Patrol concluded that ``(t)he proposal *&blank;*&blank;* appears to be in conflict with the
`Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992' *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the Washington DOT argued that ``(r)ather than stating a policy that the FHWA is ambivalent about whether
the states allow containerized cargo to be treated as non-divisible, it would seem better to encourage a national
policy that they are not. This would alleviate competition on this point among ports to make their services more amenable
to haulers and shippers.'' South Dakota contended that ``(j)ust because the container is `sealed' or is `moving in
international commerce' should not preclude a loaded container from meeting the same size and weight requirements
which exists for a load which is loaded in a container, such as a truck box, not `sealed' and not `moving in international
commerce.'''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA recommended that the proposal to allow containers to be treated as nondivisible loads be dropped and that the
issue be addressed in the rulemaking to implement the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advocates argued that the FHWA had ``openly contravened Congressional intent'' expressed in section 4006 of
the ISTEA ``by explicitly endorsing the prospective regular issuance of such permits for any `sealed containerized
cargo in international commerce.'''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FHWA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA agrees that there is a serious question whether the proposal to allow States to treat containers in international
commerce as nondivisible loads is consistent with the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992 (Safe
Container Act) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;548, 106 Stat. 3646, partly codified at 49 U.S.C. 508). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Briefly, the Safe Container Act requires the party tendering a loaded intermodal container or trailer with a cargo
weight in excess of 10,000 pounds to provide the initial carrier a written certification of the cargo weight and a reasonable
description of the contents. Each carrier in the intermodal chain is required to transmit the certification to the
next carrier. Motor carriers are prohibited from hauling loaded intermodal containers or trailers subject to the
Safe Container Act without receiving a certification. It is also illegal to coerce a motor carrier to haul such a container
or trailer (1) without a certification or (2) when the certified weight would make the combination vehicle exceed
applicable State weight limits. There are two statutory options if State enforcement personnel discover an overweight
tractor-chassis-intermodal container (or tractor-intermodal semitrailer) combination which is on the highway
because the motor carrier relied on a false or erroneous certified weight. First, the State is authorized to assess
the overweight fine against the initial tenderer and to impound the container or trailer until that party or the beneficial
owner of the cargo has paid the fine. Second, if the State fines the motor carrier instead of trying to collect from the
shipper or beneficial owner, the motor carrier has a lien on the contents of the container or trailer equal to the amount
of the fine imposed and any additional costs incurred in the incident until it receives payment from the tenderer or
beneficial owner. If payment is not made within a reasonable time, the carrier may sell the contents to satisfy the
lien. The FHWA's proposed regulations to implement the Safe Container Act were published on July 14, 1993, at 58 FR
37895. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Safe Container Act imposes administrative requirements and costs on tens of thousands of intermodal shippers
around the world, and on the international transportation system, in part to reduce the number of overweight containers
operating on the Nation's highways. The Safe Container Act is designed to give U.S. motor carriers enough information
about the weight and cargo characteristics of intermodal containers and trailers to enable them to decide whether
a particular vehicle can be transported without violating State weight limits. If States were allowed to continue
routinely to issue nondivisible load permits for overweight containers, some of the essential purposes of the Safe
Container Act would appear to be compromised. There would be little incentive for shippers to load intermodal containers
or trailers with U.S. weight limits in mind, little if any reduction in the number of overweight vehicles (even though
a permit makes them legal), and little reduction in pavement and bridge damage. Many of the expected benefits of the
Safe Container Act would be lost, and the regulatory burdens it entails for shippers and carriers would be pointless,
if the FHWA adopted the rule on containers proposed in the SNPRM. The FHWA has therefore decided not to promulgate a

The members of the Specialized Carriers &amp; Rigging Association (SCRA) often move loads that would qualify as nondivisible
by any definition. The SCRA noted that the definition proposed by the SNPRM explained expert knowledge as familiarity
with procedures required to dismantle and reassemble a load which are ``beyond the job requirements typically associated
with positions in the motor carrier industry.'' The Association argued that because highly specialized skills are
typically associated with positions in its segment of the motor carrier industry, the definition would make it impossible
for special carriers and riggers to obtain nondivisible load permits.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA agrees that a test based on ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' is too complicated and ambiguous
to be effective. It has therefore been replaced with a test based on the time required to divide a load. This general
approach was suggested by the Oregon DOT in response to the NPRM. The full definition adopted by this rule is as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nondivisible load or vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As used in this part, ``nondivisible'' means any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits
which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, i.e., make it unable to perform the function for which it was intended;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, i.e., make it unusable for its intended purpose; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Require more than 8 workhours to dismantle using appropriate equipment. The applicant for a nondivisible load
permit has the burden of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A State may treat emergency response vehicles and casks designed and used for the transport of spent nuclear materials
as nondivisible vehicles or loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first two tests proposed in the SNPRM, and adopted here as paragraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii), have elicited little
comment and no controversy. These standards are appropriate but very stringent. The FHWA believes there are loads
that could be divided without literally destroying their value, but only after unreasonable delay and expense to
the shipper and motor carrier; the States should be allowed to issue nondivisible load permits in those cases. As the
Pennsylvania DOT recognized, this is essentially an ``economic criterion.'' Our earlier proposals to codify this
idea would have allowed nondivisible load permits if dismantling the load imposed ``significant additional costs
on the shipper or motor carrier'' (NPRM) or required ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' (SNPRM). The
final rule uses 8 workhours, i.e., a full working day, as a proxy for nondivisibility. The number of workhours required
by the rule is the same no matter how many people are involved; for example, if one person working 8 hours, 2 people working
4 hours each, or 4 people working 2 hours apiece, could not dismantle the load, it would be nondivisible. Most loads
that require more than one full workday to dismantle, using appropriate equipment, probably were not designed to
be taken apart after leaving the factory. We believe Congress intended to allow the use of nondivisible load permits
for cargoes which are theoretically divisible, but so tightly integrated that they cannot be dismantled without
excessive cost and delay. On the other hand, the definition sets a standard high enough to keep easily divided overweight
machinery and equipment off the highway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition adopted today as paragraph (1)(iii) is more objective than that proposed in the NPRM and less confusing
than the amended version included in the SNPRM. It remains complex, however, and disagreements between enforcement
officers, motor carriers, and shippers are likely. The rule does not specify how State officials are to determine
the length of time required to break down a given load. Manufacturers may sometimes provide the necessary information.
The motor carrier itself may have reliable data if it has previously dismantled such cargoes. The rule does not require
a carrier or shipper to demonstrate that a given load cannot be broken down in less than 8 workhours, but it would not
prohibit a State from requiring such a demonstration either. Enforcement officials may be able to work out other reliable
methods in cooperation with motor carriers. Paragraph (1)(iii) requires that ``appropriate equipment'' be used
in an effort to dismantle a cargo. The number of workers involved and the type of equipment used will depend on the load
to be moved. A State is not required to grant a permit in any case, and it would certainly be reasonable to deny a permit
to a carrier or shipper which makes a perfunctory or deliberately inadequate effort to dismantle a load within 8 workhours.

Overweight and Overwidth Vehicles: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In many cases, nondivisible load permits are likely to be requested for loads which are both overweight and overwidth.
The South Dakota DOT favored the definition of a nondivisible load adopted by the Western Association of State Highway
Officials (WASHTO), which includes the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Portions of a load can be detached and reloaded on the same hauling unit provided that the separate pieces are necessary
to the operation of the machine or equipment which is being hauled, if the arrangement does not exceed permittable
limits.

For example, suppose that a ten foot wide crawler tractor with a fourteen foot wide dozer is to be moved. This load can
be moved two ways, overweight and fourteen feet wide with the dozer and ten feet wide without the dozer. Clearly the
safest way to move the load would be legal weight and ten feet wide but separating the dozer from the crawler tractor
destroys the unit for its intended use and it requires expert knowledge to take the dozer off.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has misread the FHWA's proposed definition. Although a bulldozer might be temporarily ``unusable for its
intended purpose'' without a blade, that phrase merely clarifies the term ``destroy the value of the load.'' Removing
the blade certainly would not destroy the value of the bulldozer. The ``expert knowledge'' test has been eliminated,
but it is unclear whether a blade would require more than 8 workhours to remove. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flaw in the WASHTO definition is that it allows the separate pieces of an allegedly nondivisible load to be reloaded
onto the same vehicle. That defeats the purpose of such a provision, which is to hold down vehicle weights in order to
protect the public investment in roads and bridges. The WASHTO definition simply allows a divisible load permit to
masquerade as a nondivisible load permit. That is unacceptable.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FHWA seems to assume that all overlength (and over-width) loads are also overweight. Much of the equipment used in
agriculture is oversize, but not overweight. Allowing the removal of a portion of this type of machinery such as tires
and allowing it to be carried on the same trailer is clearly in the public interest, especially when in all respects,
the machinery is otherwise eligible for a nondivisible load permit. Requiring a second vehicle to haul the removed
part(s) is not smart economics.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a piece of farm machinery is overwidth but not overweight, the State may either issue an overwidth permit, make the
permit conditional upon the removal of tires but allow them to be carried on the same trailer, or deny a permit. These
options are entirely within the discretion of the State. If farm machinery is neither overwidth nor overweight, the
question of divisibility would not arise unless two or more cargo-carrying units were needed to transport it, certainly
a rare occurrence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
California Policy: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Highway Patrol also argued that ``there are incidents involving the transportation of some nondivisible
loads, when more than one unit is loaded, (and) can be transported safely. To qualify, loads would have to be oversize,
rather than overweight in nature. California permit policy allows the transportation of multiple nondivisible
pieces together, provided sufficient supporting justification is given.'' The Caltrans asked for a definition
that allows this kind of flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States may allow several nondivisible overwidth loads on the same vehicle, as long as the normal weight limits are
observed. That appears to be what California authorizes. As mentioned above, Federal law gives the States great discretion
in issuing permits for overwidth loads. There would also be no conflict with Federal regulations if a State allowed
more than one overlength nondivisible load to be carried on a single trailer vehicle_assuming the vehicle was not
overweight_because the FHWA's definition of a nondivisible load applies only to overlength nondivisible loads
carried on two or more cargo-carrying units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. C79&hyph;057B, an unreported 1979 Wyoming Federal district court decision, in support of the proposition that
safety should be considered in any definition of nondivisible loads. Rocky Mountain Prestress manufactured concrete
panels that were to be mounted, two at a time, on A-frame trailers and transported from Denver to Casper for use in construction
projects. Wyoming law allowed special permits for overweight ``indivisible loads,'' but the Highway Department
rejected plaintiff's application on the ground that two panels were a divisible load. Plaintiff sued the Chief Engineer
of the Department, arguing among other things that Wyoming's permit law violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.
The court held the law constitutional, but found that it had been applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner which
impermissibly burdened interstate commerce. The court explained that:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Our conclusion is buttressed by the admission of the Defendants that heavy equipment which is being carried by trailer
qualifies as an indivisible load even though the parts thereof may be easily dismantled. Such an approach to granting
overweight permits signifies that the State Highway Department has previously, as they must in this case, considered
circumstances other than the mere physical divisibility of the goods in transit.

We would also observe that forestry goods, baled hay and sugar beets are statutory exceptions to the mandated weight
limits. The special interest group exceptions in the Wyoming statutes discriminate against the Plaintiff and others
similarly situated who may be equally deserving of exceptions from the weight limitation in view of the safety and
economic factors involved. *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* [T]he State's desire to protect its highways has been severely diluted by the discriminatory
granting of overweight permits to special interest groups, as well as by the routine issuance of such permits based
on an indivisible load regulatory provision that we believe was arbitrarily and capriciously applied to the Plaintiff.

FHWA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The court concluded that ``the `A' frame is the safest *&blank;*&blank;* mode of transportation for loading and shipping
panels,'' but its evidence on that point was meager. The issue of safe transportation of concrete panels was discussed
at some length in the SNPRM (see 58 FR 11455&hyph;11457). As we noted there, a single panel, mounted horizontally,
would improve the vehicle's braking capability and reduce its susceptibility to side winds. Two such panels obviously
constitute a divisible load, and a ``safety'' rationale for doubling the weight of a divisible load is not persuasive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Black Hills Trucking now contends that one panel cannot be carried horizontally because it ``is not constructed to
stand up to forces coming through its sides,'' or vertically ``because it is not heavy enough in proportion to the `sail'
area exposed to side winds which destabilize the load.'' The apparent fragility of these concrete panels does not
make two of them any less divisible. Furthermore, the Great Plains experience winds high enough to overturn tractor
trailer combinations and double-stack container trains. The interests of safety are better served by halting trucking
operations under those conditions than by doubling the weight of the cargo in an effort to anchor the vehicle.

decision is not binding on the FHWA. To the extent this rule requires Wyoming to adopt and enforce a new definition for
purposes of issuing nondivisible load overweight permits for the Interstate System, it is no longer binding on the
State either. The 1979 decision was based upon the State's arbitrary and capricious administration of its own permit
law, in particular its failure to apply that law consistently to all motor carriers and commodities. At the time, there
was no Federal law on nondivisible loads. Congress enacted nondivisible load provisions for vehicle weight in 1982
and for vehicle length in 1991. Proposed regulations to implement that authority have been subjected to extensive
comment and discussion in this rulemaking. Wyoming, like the other States, will be required to adopt the new definition
for Interstate operations. That definition will result in greatly increased nationwide uniformity in the treatment
of nondivisible loads. Wyoming will have no more administrative discretion than any other State. A judicial challenge
to the FHWA's definition of a nondivisible load would therefore confront a legal and factual situation completely
different from that which existed in 1979.

Emergency Vehicles: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1023(e)(1) of the ISTEA prohibited the FHWA from penalizing States that allow emergency vehicles to use the
Interstate at weights in excess of Federal axle and Bridge Formula limits. The exemption was in effect for 2 years after
the date of enactment of the ISTEA and expired on December 18, 1993. Section 1023(e) also required a study of State laws
and permit practices to determine whether statutory changes were needed to accommodate emergency vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To carry out the study, the FHWA requested comments on a variety of questions (57 FR 46941, October 13, 1992). The information
submitted indicated that most fire trucks exceed the Federal single- and/or tandem-axle weight limits (20,000 and
34,000 pounds, respectively). These vehicles are rarely short enough to violate the Bridge Formula, however, and
almost all of them have gross weights under 80,000 pounds. Technological developments in the manufacturing sector
combined with the equipment preferences of fire departments are driving up the size and, especially, the weight of
fire trucks. On the other hand, tandem and tridem axles are not favored because they reduce the maneuverability these
vehicles need to reach burning buildings. Some States exempt fire equipment from normal weight limits, and others
issue blanket overweight permits. The Caltrans reached a compromise with fire officials that will require the latter
to observe specific axle limits for various types of vehicles and to make purchasing decisions accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. DOT's report was transmitted to Congress on September 7, 1993. It recommended that Congress take no further
action because the matter could be resolved by an FHWA policy statement. On November 9, 1993, the Federal Highway Administrator
informed the FHWA's regional offices, and through them the States, that ``the FHWA will not withhold Federal-aid
funds from States which issue nondivisible load permits to emergency vehicles equipped for their intended use. We
will not require that the vehicles have a full crew or be operating under emergency conditions. States may set whatever
permit terms, conditions, and fees they consider appropriate.'' The Federal Highway Administrator added that this
policy ``is compatible with the Agency's draft definition'' published on February 25, 1993, in the SNPRM and that
if it ``in any way conflicts with the definition ultimately adopted through the rulemaking process, appropriate
action will be taken to amend or rescind the policy.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Federal Highway Administrator's decision was based upon conclusions set forth in his November 9, 1993, letter:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some States may have refused to issue nondivisible load permits to emergency vehicles because much of their equipment
is readily detachable. Fire trucks often carry firefighting teams, water, hoses, axes, respirators and other devices;
advanced life support vehicles typically carry at least two paramedics (one of whom drives), defibrillators, oxygen
tanks, stretchers, and medical supplies. In one sense, ancillary equipment and personnel are ``divisible'' parts
of the load, and removing them might lighten an emergency vehicle enough to restore compliance with Interstate weight
limits. Doing so, however, would defeat the purpose of these vehicles and make it impossible for them to respond effectively
to emergencies. New vehicles may even be overweight as they leave the final stage manufacturing facility, either
because the base vehicle is particularly heavy or because ancillary equipment is supplied with it. The equipment
that could be removed from emergency vehicles to reduce weight is essential to the services they are designed to perform.
These vehicles and loads are functionally if not physically nondivisible, and I believe the States should have the
option to treat them as such.

In the language of the regulation we are adopting today, requiring an emergency vehicle to unload separable pieces

Spent Nuclear Fuel:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pennsylvania DOT pointed out that the FHWA informed the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials several years ago that the FHWA regards overweight casks used to move spent nuclear fuel as nondivisible.
This determination was not reflected in the SNPRM. The casks used to transport spent nuclear materials, especially
nuclear fuel, are extraordinarily strong and heavy, both to prevent a release in case the transporter vehicle was
involved in an accident and to block radiation that would penetrate lighter materials. Some of these containment
devices can make a vehicle overweight even before the nuclear materials are loaded. These vehicles cannot be used
for any other cargo or reduced to legal weights without frustrating their purpose. A new provision has therefore been
added which essentially states that specially designed casks used to move spent nuclear fuel meet the definition
of a nondivisible load.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Connecticut DOT suggested that we use the definition of a nondivisible load to establish ``an Ultimate Limit or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA mentioned in the SNPRM that bulk commodities such as liquids, grain, and cement are inherently divisible.
The CRASH suggested that the definition include ``a much more complete listing of loads that are inherently divisible
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' In view of the enormous variety of products that move by truck, we do not believe divisible
loads could reasonably be itemized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grove Worldwide, a manufacturer of cranes, proposed that a load be defined as nondivisible if dismantling it would
cause a competitive disadvantage, compromise the integrity and safety of the equipment when disassembled, or jeopardize
the warranty. The FHWA considers these tests too far removed from the question of physical divisibility to be appropriate.

published today as appendix C to 23 CFR part 658. Any person or State may request that the Secretary review the final
list to determine if there is cause to believe that it contains a mistake. The Secretary may also initiate the review.
If the Secretary believes an error exists, he or she must commence a proceeding to determine if the list should be corrected,
and if so, make the correction. Proposed language establishing such a procedure was included in the SNPRM. No comments
were received on this issue. Accordingly, that language has been adopted, unchanged, by this final rule in &sect;658.23(f).

Temporary Exemption for Public Transit Vehicles

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1023 of the ISTEA was amended by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act
for fiscal year (FY) 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;388, 106 Stat. 1520. Section 341 added a new subsection (h) which reads
in part as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporary Exemption._The second sentence of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, relating to axle weight
limitations for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, shall not apply,
in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively
used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus. The Secretary may extend such 2-year period for an additional
year. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This prevents the FHWA from sanctioning States that fail to enforce the Interstate axle-weight limits for public
transit vehicles at least until October 6, 1994. If the Secretary exercises the authority to extend the exemption
an additional year, it would apply until October 6, 1995. The 2-year exemption was included in the ISTEA to allow States
to suspend axle weight enforcement on the Interstate System against public transit vehicles while the Secretary
conducts the study called for in section 1023(h)(2). That study, which is currently underway, is to determine whether
or not public transit vehicles should be exempted from the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 127, State weight laws, or if such
laws should be modified to accommodate these vehicles. The FHWA and the Federal Transit Administration published
a joint notice and request for comments on this issue on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60481). A report on the results of the
study, along with recommendations, will ultimately be submitted by the Secretary to Congress.

In a comment to the SNPRM docket, the American Public Transit Association urged that the temporary exemption language
be codified into part 658. The FHWA agrees with this comment. Accordingly, the exemption is codified in this final
rule at &sect;658.17(k).

Temporary Exemption for Emergency Vehicles

Section 1023(e) of the ISTEA added the following exemption from 23 U.S.C. 127:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Temporary Exemption._The second sentence of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, relating to axle weight
limitations and the bridge formula for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways,
shall not apply, in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to any existing vehicle which
is used for the purpose of protecting persons and property from fires and other disasters that threaten public safety
and which is in actual operation before such date of enactment and to any new vehicle to be used for such purpose while
such vehicle is being delivered to a fire fighting agency. The Secretary may extend such 2-year period for an additional
year.

This prevented the FHWA from sanctioning States that failed to enforce the Interstate axle-weight and Bridge Formula
limits for fire or emergency vehicles in actual operation on or before December 18, 1991, and for such equipment being
delivered from the manufacturer to a fire department. The normal gross weight limit was not affected by the exemption.
The exemption remained in effect through December 18, 1993. The SNPRM proposed to codify the exemption at &sect;658.17(k).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received on this issue. The South Dakota DOT expressed its desire to go on record as ``not in favor
of allowing a temporary or permanent axle weight exemption or bridge formula weight exemption for emergency vehicles.''
The State contends that ``operation of these vehicles overweight threatens the public's safety'' and ``that emergency
vehicles should be designed to operate within legal size and weight limits.'' The Caltrans objected to the FHWA's
interpretation of the law which indicated that the normal gross weight limit (80,000 pounds) remained in effect during
the period of the exemption. They contend that gross weight is determined by the Bridge Formula and that our interpretation
was contradictory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that Congress intended the exemption in section 1023(e)(1) to cover (1) single- and tandem-axle
limits, (2) application of the bridge formula to intermediate axles (the inner bridge limits), and (3) application
of the Bridge Formula to the overall wheelbase of the vehicle (the outer bridge limit). However, the 80,000-pound
maximum gross weight allowed by 23 U.S.C. 127(a) is not inherently part of the Bridge Formula. It is a separate statutory
restriction, and we do not believe Congress intended to authorize an exemption to the 80,000-pound limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 2-year exemption was included in the ISTEA to allow States to suspend enforcement action against these vehicles
while the Secretary conducted the study called for in section 1023(e)(2). That study has been completed, as indicated
above, and the authority of the Secretary to extend the temporary exemption an additional year will not be exercised.
The temporary exemption expired December 18, 1993. However, the definition of a nondivisible load adopted in this
final rule specifically declares emergency vehicles to be nondivisible. States may therefore issue overweight
permits for these vehicles if they wish.

Interstate System Weight Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first sentence in 23 U.S.C. 127(a) was amended by the STAA of 1982 to require all States to allow the maximum weights
permitted by Federal law on the Interstate System. In effect, the weight limits set forth in section 127 became minimums
which the States must allow, as well as the maximums the States could allow, on the Interstate System. Since the STAA
amendment of section 127 became effective (January 6, 1983), States have occasionally argued that the amendment
applied only to the single-axle, tandem-axle, and maximum gross weight limits, and not to gross weights developed
by the Bridge Formula. In addition, a degree of confusion regarding applicability has lingered over the years as a
result of the regulations issued to implement the STAA (49 FR 23302, June 5, 1984). Although those regulations were
published 11/2 years after enactment of the STAA, the statutory action making the weight value minimums was not highlighted
nor was any regulatory language included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNPRM proposed to clarify and resolve this issue by including a &sect;658.17(f) as follows. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a single axle,
34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the bridge formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including
all enforcement tolerances.

Comments on this proposal were received from six State Departments of Transportation (Arizona, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington), as well as from the WASHTO's Subcommittee on Highway Transport. All seven
commenters objected to the paragraph as proposed for fear that it would no longer allow the States to further control
axle weight using a regulation based on pounds per inch of tire width. Each of the six States providing direct comments
currently has this type of weight control regulation in force. The ``Guide For Uniform Laws and Regulations Governing
Truck Size and Weight Among the WASHTO States,'' prepared by the WASHTO Subcommittee on Highway Transport and adopted
by the WASHTO Policy Committee on June 26, 1993, recommends that all 17 member States adopt a 600-pound/inch tire width
weight control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State tire loading regulations are intended to limit the use of single tires or wheels designed for dual tire applications.
This is a practice which results in higher pavement stress and shorter pavement life, and greatly reduces the safety
margin provided by dual tires. Depending on the pound-per-inch limit chosen, these regulations may also restrict
the use of some ``super single'' tires. The Washington State DOT included in its docket comments a copy of a report of
research on the effects of wide based single tires on flexible pavements conducted by the FHWA at our Pavement Testing
Facility during 1989 and 1990. Dual 11R22.5 radial tires, previously identified as one of the most common truck tires
in use today, were tested against a 425/65R22.5 wide base single tire. Under a load rating methodology established
by the United States Tire and Rim Association, the load ratings for the duals and the single are equivalent; however,
the footprint on the pavement is significantly different. The approximate footprint of an 11R22.5 tire is 8.5 inches.
Thus, two sets of duals (four tires) can result in approximately 34 inches of tire being available to transmit an axle
load to the pavement. For the 425/65R22.5 wide base tire, the footprint is approximately 11 inches, which would make
approximately 22 inches available to transmit an axle load to the pavement. The research demonstrated that the 425/65R22.5
wide based single tire was significantly more damaging to conventional flexible pavements than the traditional
11R22.5 dual tires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal axle weight limits on the Interstate System were adopted to protect the tremendous Federal investment
in that System. Restrictions on the weight a tire may carry, based on its width, are consistent with that goal and not
forbidden by Federal law. It would be anomalous to adopt axle weight limits to protect Interstate System pavements
and then prevent States from blocking the use of tires so narrow that much of the protection was lost. In addition, a
pound-per-inch tire limit does not directly limit the weight that an axle may carry, since additional or wider tires
may be utilized. Therefore, unless such restrictions operate so that, as a practical matter, axles cannot be loaded
to the Federal weight limits, they are not inconsistent with 23 U.S.C. 127. We believe that laws limiting tire weights
as low as 500 pounds per inch width of tire or tread width will allow axles to be loaded to the Federal axle weight limits
without particular difficulty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steering axles must be treated differently, however, since they cannot always be equipped with wider or additional
tires. The FHWA has already recognized a different standard for steering axles by not requiring States to allow truckers
to load them to 20,000 pounds when the manufacturer's weight rating is less than that. Therefore, States may not impose
pound-per-inch restrictions that would reduce the allowed weight of steering axles on the Interstate System to less
than 20,000 pounds or the manufacturer's weight rating, whichever is lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arizona, Montana, and Oregon also suggested that proposed &sect;658.17(f) be amended to allow temporary weight
restrictions based on climatic conditions or emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some northern States have for decades enforced lower axle limits during spring thaw. When moisture in a pavement's
sub-base, frozen during the winter months, begins to melt, the load-carrying capacity of the pavement structure
is reduced until the moisture drains. The degree of reduction is a function of the overall pavement structure thickness,
the type of underlying material, amount of moisture, and depth of frost penetration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal weight restrictions apply only to the Interstate System. The standards to which the System has been built
include pavement designs developed with the strength to allow maximum legal weights year round. The FHWA does not
agree that there is a need to provide regulatory flexibility for climatic conditions. The pavement design parameters
of the Interstate System preclude the need for this authority. However, the States do retain the authority to establish
such restrictions for highways that are not part of the Interstate System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Emergency'' weight restrictions requested by States generally are not restrictions at all, but rather the lessening
of restrictions to allow heavier weights. For example, when natural disasters occur, carriers, relief agencies,
or States would often like to allow trucks carrying relief supplies to exceed normal weight limits. Federal law simply
does not allow waivers of this kind. On the other hand, if a flood or earthquake has seriously weakened a bridge or stretch
of pavement, it remains within the police powers of the State or municipality to close or limit access to the facility
in order to protect the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the three exceptions to &sect;658.17(f) sought by commenters, the FHWA agrees that States should retain the authority
to enforce the tire loading restrictions, but does not concur in the request to provide climatic or emergency restrictions.
Accordingly, &sect;658.17(f), as proposed in the SNPRM, is amended to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;658.17

(f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000
pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum
of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 pounds per
inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit
steering axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established by the manufacturer, whichever is
lower.

Bus Length and Access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4006(b)(1) of the ISTEA amended section 411(a) of the STAA [49 U.S.C. app. 2311(a)] by inserting ``of less
than 45 feet on the length of any bus,'' after ``vehicle length limitation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4006(b)(2) of the ISTEA amended section 412(a)(2) of the STAA [49 U.S.C. app. 2312(a)(2)] by inserting ``motor
carrier of passengers'' after ``household goods carriers.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first provision has the effect of requiring States to allow buses with a length of 45 feet or less on the NN and reasonable
access routes. The second provision requires States to allow motor carriers of passengers to have the same access
off the NN as household goods carriers, i.e., to ``points of loading and unloading.'' In the SNPRM, the FHWA proposed
changes to the ``Length'' and ``Reasonable Access'' sections of part 658 to account for these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on this proposal were received from the Caltrans and the Department of California Highway Patrol. Both agencies
recommended that a final rule include definitions of both ``bus'' and ``motor carrier of passengers'' to ``prevent
confusion on the interpretation and application of the regulations.'' The FHWA agrees with this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The STAA defines a ``commercial motor vehicle'' in part as ``any self-propelled *&blank;*&blank;* vehicle used
on the highways in [interstate] commerce principally to transport passengers *&blank;*&blank;* (B) if such vehicle
is designed to transport more than 10 passengers, including the driver *&blank;*&blank;*'' (49 U.S.C. app. 2301(1)(B)).
While this definition applies only to subchapter I of chapter 32 of title 49, U.S.C., which makes grants available
to States that agree to enforce Federal, or compatible State, safety regulations, it is an indication of congressional
intent. For purposes of administering the commercial vehicle safety program, ``bus'' was defined in 49 CFR 390.5
as ``any motor vehicle designed, constructed, and or used for the transportation of passengers, including taxicabs.''
The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 amended the definition of a bus to a ``vehicle designed to transport more than 15
passengers, including the driver *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (49 U.S.C. app. 2503(1)(B)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of Congress, as expressed in the ISTEA, is to guarantee national route availability and reasonable access
for ``buses'' not exceeding 45 feet in length. Since virtually all States already allowed 40-foot buses to operate
Statewide prior to the ISTEA, the number of passengers the vehicle is designed to carry is not an issue, simply the establishment
of a national standard length. Accordingly, this final rule will use the most generic of the definitions already established,
that found in 49 CFR 390.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the term ``motor carrier of passengers'' has not previously been defined, this type of operation can generally
be characterized as belonging to at least one of three groups: (1) Common carriers that offer service on regular (and
sometimes on irregular) routes, (2) contract carriers that provide charter service to groups, or (3) private carriers
that do not serve the public but use buses as part of some other enterprise. Someone who uses a 45-foot bus for recreational
or other non-business purposes would not qualify as a motor carrier of passengers. For this final rule ``motor carrier
of passengers'' is defined as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fruehauf Trailer Corporation (Fruehauf) commented that the FHWA should clarify the methods by which length is determined
for trailers which are part of a multi-unit vehicle subject to the freeze. Because of the attention focused on the LCV
length issue by the freeze, Fruehauf contends that it is important that all States (and enforcement agencies) have
a uniform understanding of how the length of the individual units is to be determined. Fruehauf's specific concern
is with full trailers used in LCV's which are actually made up of a semitrailer and a converter dolly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a Notice of Interpretation (NOI) published on March 13, 1987, at 52 FR 7834, the FHWA addressed the issue of trailer
or semitrailer length, as part of an overall discussion of length and width exclusive devices. The first length interpretation

1. The length of a semitrailer equipped with an upper coupler (mates with a truck tractor fifth wheel) and a full trailer
(with either a permanently mounted dolly or equipped with a converter dolly) is to be measured from the front vertical
plane of the foremost transverse load carrying structure to the rear vertical plane of the rearmost transverse load
carrying structure. The towbar of a full trailer is excluded from the length measurement (of that trailer) since,
technically, it carries no load, but rather it is the means by which the trailer unit is drawn.

determination of these units.

This final rule will also amend appendix A to 23 CFR part 658, National Network_Federally-Designated Routes, to reflect
the inclusion of the I&hyph;580 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge (toll) in the NN. Under the STAA, all Interstate System
routes are part of the NN unless deletion is authorized by law. The I&hyph;580 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge was withheld
from the NN until a direct connection to I&hyph;80 from the east end of the bridge could be completed. This condition
was reflected in Note 1 to the California listing of NN routes in appendix A. Now that this connection has been completed,
the FHWA is amending appendix A by removing Note 1 and redesignating Note 2 as ``Note.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment will merely reflect the fact that the I&hyph;580 Richmond-San Rafael Bridge is now included in the
NN pursuant to the provisions of the STAA. For this reason, and the others set forth above, the FHWA has determined that
prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this action are unnecessary. Furthermore, due to the technical
nature of this amendment, the FHWA has determined that prior notice and opportunity for comment are not required under
the U.S. Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, as it is not anticipated that such action
will result in receipt of useful information.

The ISTEA freeze applies to the operation of specified CMV's on the Interstate and other portions of the NN. The identification
of NN routes in Virginia contained in appendix A to 23 CFR part 658 utilizes Interstate System exit numbers to identify
the beginning or end of some NN routes. During 1992, the State converted all Interstate System exit numbers from a consecutive
number system to a milepost numbering system. In response to this portion of the SNPRM, the State indicated that there
appeared to be a discrepancy between what was published in the SNPRM and what the State was considering to be its NN.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State list not only includes those highway sections designated by the Secretary which comprise appendix A to part
658, but also additional segments which the State has also decided to open to STAA vehicles. Each State retains the
authority to open additional mileage, beyond what is listed in appendix A of part 658, to STAA vehicles without the
approval of the Secretary. In order to identify NN routes in Virginia which have been federally designated, we are
reissuing the State's NN routes in appendix A, 23 CFR part 658, to reflect the new milepost-based exit numbers.

 means a truck tractor combined with a semi-trailer and a separable cargo-carrying unit which is designed to be loaded

Although the term maxi-cube was intended to apply to a specific combination of straight truck and trailing unit, the
1987 language described the power unit as a ``truck tractor,'' which the STAA elsewhere defines as ``the noncargo
carrying power unit that operates in combination with a semitrailer or trailer *&blank;*&blank;* `` (49 U.S.C. app.
2311(f)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Theoretically, therefore, the maxi-cube is a noncargo-carrying power unit combined with a semitrailer and a separable
cargo-carrying unit which is designed to be loaded and unloaded through the semi-trailer. Unfortunately, this vehicle
is a chimera. The separable cargo-carrying unit cannot be placed on the ``noncargo carrying'' power unit, and if it
were placed on the semitrailer, the result would seem to be a truck tractor-chassis-intermodal container combination.
Container vehicles had long been legal, however, so the 1987 language certainly was not directed at them. In some sense
all containers and semitrailers are designed to be loaded and unloaded ``through'' themselves, but the description
does not really fit a combination with only one cargo-carrying unit. The fact is that the definition of the vehicle
to be authorized did not correspond to the actual vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing the problem, Congress amended the STAA again in 1990 to make maxi-cubes ``specialized equipment'' and
thus eligible for the special regulatory treatment authorized by 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(d). The accompanying report
of the House Appropriations Committee said the following:

The bill includes language (Sec. 327) amending section 411(d) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982
regarding maxi-cube vehicles. A maxi-cube vehicle is a truck combination consisting of a power unit capable of carrying
cargo that pulls a semitrailer. The power unit is a single or tandem axle truck that carries either a detachable or a
permanently attached cargo box or platform. The trailing unit is a semitrailer attached to the front unit by a specially
built draw bar which gives the entire combination a single point of articulation. The front of the rear unit is specially
designed so cargo may be loaded through the rear unit to the front unit. The length of the trailing cargo unit can be no
more than 34 feet excluding the draw bar. The distance from the front of the cargo box on the power unit to the rear of the
trailing unit can be no more than 60 feet.

Although this is an accurate description of a maxi-cube, the flawed definition of the same vehicle in 49 U.S.C. app.
2311(f)(2) was not repealed. In the SNPRM, the FHWA therefore exercised its broad discretionary authority over specialized
equipment to propose a definition of the maxi-cube that largely codified the policy guidance of the Committee Report
while omitting or modifying the erroneous parts of the statutory definition. We believe this is consistent with the
principle that ambiguous or confusing statutes must be interpreted and implemented in a manner that minimizes difficulties
and produces the most sensible result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of a maxi-cube proposed in the SNPRM has been adopted in this final rule, with slight modifications
for clarity. It should be noted that the word ``semitrailer'' used in the statute and Committee Report has been changed
to ``trailer or semitrailer,'' since some of the vehicles built as maxi-cubes in recent years are equipped with pintle-hooks,
non-load-bearing hitches used for full trailers. Others are equipped with load-bearing fifth-wheel hitches typical
of semitrailers. This modification of the definition is well within the FHWA's authority to promulgate rules to accommodate
specialized equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNPRM also proposed that maxi-cube vehicles should be measured with the adjustable-length drawbar (if so equipped)
at its maximum extension, since we assumed that was how the drawbar would be positioned for over-the-road operations.
The Pennsylvania DOT supported this proposal in its comments to the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears, however, that adjustable drawbars usually are not fully extended when the vehicle is in motion. Magna
Van and Coca Cola commented that 24 inches is the normal distance between the first and second units of their maxi-cube
vehicles during over-the-road operations, but that longer distances are used for access to driveways and transferring
freight in off-road situations. Other information submitted to the docket indicated that 27 inches is probably the
longest distance between cargo units for highway travel. However, there are times when a longer drawbar setting may
be desirable, such as on rough terrain to keep the cargo boxes from hitting each other; in urban areas while making sharp
turns; or while loading and unloading cargo from the front unit while the rear unit is attached. The maximum reported
unit separation in these instances is 42 inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes Congress intended the maxi-cube length limits to apply to vehicles in their normal operational
configuration. We have concluded that the cargo capacity of these vehicles would be needlessly reduced if the rule
required length measurements to be made with the drawbar at maximum extension, since that position is used only to
assist in low-speed maneuvering or loading and unloading. The last sentence of &sect;658.13(e)(4) has therefore
been modified to read: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the maxi-cube vehicle is equipped with an adjustable drawbar, the 60- and 65-foot distances shall be measured with
a drawbar spacing of not more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that distance to maneuver
or load the vehicle.

The American Movers Conference believes that the load-through feature of the maxi-cube should be made optional.
We do not agree. That language is included both in the statutory definition in 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(f)(2) and in the Appropriations
Committee report. This feature is one of the primary reasons Congress declared maxi-cubes specialized equipment.
Removing the load-through element from the definition would make these vehicles indistinguishable from truck-trailer
combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Connecticut asked if the maxi-cube vehicle will be designated as specialized equipment since it will
be limited to the NN and reasonable access routes. Maxi-cube vehicles are by statute specialized equipment, and Federal
regulations for such equipment apply only on the NN and reasonable access routes.

Beverage Semitrailers

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A rulemaking to designate as specialized equipment the 28-foot van-type, drop-frame beverage semitrailer when
it is equipped with an upper coupler plate that extends in front of the semitrailer, has been underway since 1990. The
last action on the subject was publication of an NPRM on June 25, 1990, at 55 FR 25850. The final rule was being prepared
when the ISTEA was enacted. Since the rulemaking necessary to implement the ``LCV-freeze'' would, like the beverage
semitrailer rule, amend 23 CFR part 658, the decision was made to include both in a single document. Since they amend
the same existing regulation, combining them minimizes the number of separate changes made to an already complex
regulatory document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, established length and width standards for vehicles using the highways designated as the NN (appendix A to 23 CFR
part 658 (1993)). The STAA prohibited any State from enforcing a length limit of less than 28 feet on a semitrailer or
trailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination on the NN (49 U.S.C. app. 2311 (a)). The STAA,
under an equipment grandfather provision, also allows the use of 28.5-foot semitrailers and trailers in truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer
combinations if they were actually and lawfully operating on December 1, 1982, within a 65-foot overall length limit
in any State. The statute prohibited any State from denying reasonable access to points of loading and unloading for
a truck tractor pulling a single 28-foot (28.5-foot if grandfathered) semitrailer that generally operates as part
of a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination. In addition, the STAA gave the Secretary authority to exclude
from measurement of trailer length and width, devices necessary for the safe and efficient operation of CMV's, provided
length exclusive devices did not have, by design or use, the capability to carry cargo (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(h), 2316(b)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions involving permissible vehicle length and length exclusive devices are critical to a new design for 28-foot
beverage semitrailers. As used in this proceeding, ``beverage'' means a liquid for drinking, including water. One
new design places the kingpin under the nose of the trailer with a portion of the upper coupler plate extending beyond
the front of the vehicle. Since these beverage semitrailers use an enclosed van-type, drop-frame design, mounting
the kingpin in this manner allows the drop-frame portion of the semitrailer to be extended forward. The FHWA has issued
several NOI of length and width exclusive devices. The most recent was published on March 13, 1987, at 52 FR 7834. That
NOI recognized a number of length-exclusive design features, including (1) the pickup plate lip of the upper coupler,
and (2) any non-load-carrying device which falls within the swing radius of the semitrailer (measured from the center
line of the kingpin to the front corner of the semitrailer). As applied to the new design described above, these two
provisions have proved difficult to administer and have caused confusion and misunderstanding between the FHWA
and the industry. The June 25, 1990, NPRM proposed to designate as specialized equipment van-type, drop-frame beverage
semitrailers. A 30-day comment period (through July 25, 1990) was provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to seeking general comments, the NPRM requested all interested parties to respond to four questions concerning
these vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA solicited comments on the following questions as well as other comments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in the proposed regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is the proposed length limit for the upper coupler extension of the semitrailer clear?

3. Will the semitrailer, as configured, be as safe as one with the upper coupler plate positioned fully under the semitrailer?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Will the position of the center of the kingpin, not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer, produce offtracking
characteristics that are significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers?

Eight responses to the June 25, 1990, NPRM were submitted to the docket. The respondents included four State Departments
of Transportation; California (Caltrans), Florida (FDOT), Minnesota (MnDOT), and Virginia (VDOT) and the Connecticut
Department of Motor Vehicles, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Hackney and Sons, Inc. (trailer manufacturer),
and one individual. Of these respondents, six favored designating the beverage semitrailer as specified equipment,
one (Caltrans) opposed, and one (VDOT) was not sure the vehicle could operate on its current system of highways for
STAA dimensioned vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Should ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in the proposed regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six respondents commented on defining the ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer.'' Two State DOT's (FDOT
and VDOT) and the Port Authority requested that the terms ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined
in order to administer the regulation without erroneous interpretations. They see this terminology as a potential
enforcement problem. The individual stated that the definition was incomplete as it was now written and should specify
that the trailer has side access only for cargo. The trailer manufacturer requested that it not be defined because
the trailers are also used for palletized cargo as well. Other types of cargo hauled on this type of trailer include
automobile batteries, coin compartments from pay telephones, mushrooms, and nursery plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trailer manufacturer also suggested that the regulation read as follows: ``with the center line of the kingpin
mounted not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer *&blank;*&blank;*.'' It requested the addition of the
words ``the center line of'' because (1) in the semitrailer design under consideration, every inch is important,
(2) this change would provide more swing clearance for the tractor under the gooseneck area of the semitrailer, (3)
the length of the trailer body would not be increased, and (4) it is common in the industry to specify kingpin location
by kingpin center. Based on these comments, the FHWA has modified the definition to state that the semitrailer have
``side access only'' and that the cargo be limited to bottled or canned beverages. The definition has also been revised
to allow the 28-foot length to be measured from the centerline of the kingpin to the rear of the semitrailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is the proposed length limit for the upper coupler extension of the semitrailer clear? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trailer manufacturer and the individual commented that the proposed length limit of the upper coupler was clear
and in a workable location. They did not foresee any possible misinterpretation. The trailer manufacturer responded
that by limiting the upper coupler extension to fall within the swing radius of the front corner of the semitrailer
it is both clear and very workable. This approach has been allowed for the purpose of excluding other front-mounted
items from length measurement and accordingly is to be used for this case as well. The FDOT commented that the proposed
length limit was not clear as described in the June 25, 1990, NPRM. The FDOT also suggests that language is needed to
assure that the coupler plate does not become a cargo carrier in and of itself and that the device stays reasonable in
length. The MnDOT responded that its law currently allows semitrailers of 28.5 feet, in three vehicle combinations,
and the proposed design would only minimally exceed the current standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with these comments, the FHWA concludes that not allowing the upper coupler plate extension to extend
beyond the swing radius of the semitrailer is a clear and sufficient means to restrict the length of this device. The
operational rules have been amended to specify that the upper coupler plate itself cannot be used to carry cargo. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will the semitrailer, as configured, be as safe as one with the upper coupler plate positioned fully under the semitrailer?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Caltrans, MnDOT, trailer manufacturer, and individual agreed that the configuration would be as safe as the upper
coupler positioned fully under the semitrailer. The FDOT commented that the final rule should include requirements
similar to those found in 49 CFR part 393, subpart F_Coupling Devices and Towing Methods. These and other Federal regulations
continue to apply to beverage trailers and need not be cross-referenced in every other applicable regulation. Due
to the specialized nature of the equipment discussed here, however, reference to an applicable provision of 49 CFR
part 393 is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trailer manufacturer responded that the configuration would be safe because the maximum kingpin-to-trailer
axle span will be 25.5 feet. A single 53-foot semitrailer can have a kingpin-to-center of trailer tandem-axle span
of 45.5 feet and still be considered safe. The individual commented that there is no reason to believe that trailers
produced to this configuration would be less safe than trailers with upper couplers fully under the trailer. Dump
trailers and short container chassis often have configurations that place the kingpin forward of the body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VDOT commented that demonstrations should be conducted with each type of semitrailer to determine any difference
between the two mounting plates. A demonstration is not necessary because this style of trailer has been in operation
for several years, and the operating characteristics are known to be compatible to other trailers in current use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments, the FHWA concludes that the semitrailer as configured will be as safe as one with the upper coupler
positioned fully under the semitrailer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Will the position of the kingpin, not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer, produce offtracking characteristics
that are significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Port Authority and the manufacturer responded ``no'' to the question. The Port Authority commented that it appears
to them that the offtracking of the beverage semitrailer combinations set forth in the proposed regulation will not
differ significantly from the conventional semitrailer combinations already permitted upon port authority vehicular
crossings. The trailer manufacturer used a ``sum of squares'' method to determine offtracking (Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) J695) and does not find a great increase in offtracking.

The individual commented that offtracking of these specialized trailers will be greater than conventional 28-foot
trailers since the distance from the kingpin to the trailer's axle will increase by up to 3 feet. Also, using the techniques
of SAE J695, he calculated the offtracking for conventional and beverage semitrailers as shown in the following table:

The FDOT responded that the potential of an extra 2 or 3 feet to the kingpin setting may be important with units running
as a tandem combination; however, as a single-unit semitrailer, the difference would be insignificant when considering
the 41-foot kingpin setting that is being discussed as a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 national limit for such settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments, the FHWA concludes that the offtracking characteristics of the beverage semitrailer being
designated as specialized equipment are not significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers.

5. Other comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Caltrans, FDOT, and MnDOT expressed concerns about future petitions for the FHWA to propose a similar rule for
longer beverage semitrailers or semitrailers of a similar design for carrying other goods. The Caltrans' concern
is that the beverage semitrailer is another small step toward allowing larger vehicles by means of an exception process.
For example, since the weight of the beverage semitrailer and load rest on the upper coupler plate extending from the
front of the semitrailer, why not allow the van portion to the semitrailer to be extended over the plate? Also, if a weight
supporting upper coupler plate is permitted for a 28-foot beverage semitrailer, is a 48-foot beverage semitrailer
next? The possibility of a 48-foot beverage semitrailer raises strong concerns about offtracking. A typical semitrailer
has the kingpin located 3 feet from the front of the semitrailer. The Caltrans' evaluation of the State Highway System
for designation of terminal access routes is on the basis of a 48-foot trailer with a 43-foot kingpin-to-center of
the rearmost axle which is equivalent to the 41-foot kingpin-to-center of tandem axles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDOT responded that the proposed rule needs to be modified to assure that other trailers/semitrailers do not grow
in length as a result of this proposed rule. It should be expected that other segments of the industry will seek the same
benefits as are being provided to the beverage haulers under this proposed rule. Similarly, the MnDOT would discourage
the FHWA from further ``piecemeal'' exemptions until a comprehensive review of the commercial vehicle length definition
is conducted. The State finds that this examination is warranted in light of the recent research from the Roads and
Transportation Association of Canada, which demonstrates that the U.S. may in fact be discouraging uniformity and
the use of more stable vehicle configurations on U.S. highways, due to current vehicle definitions. The State supported
the use of the terms ``box length'' and uniform ``kingpin or wheelbase'' for specifying length limits for commercial
vehicle equipment. On the other hand, the MnDOT also commented that the configuration under discussion here would
not have adverse effects on pavements, bridges, or maneuvering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA understands the concerns of these States about its handling of petitions from other segments of the trucking
industry for relief similar to that being provided for beverage semitrailers. The FHWA also recognizes that different
ways to specify trailer length provisions do exist. Future petitions for similar relief provisions will be evaluated
with these concerns in mind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Caltrans commented that the 28-foot beverage semitrailer was not specialized equipment, but rather
another attempt to incrementally increase (by regulatory action) the limits set by the STAA. The FHWA disagrees.
This equipment as defined by this rulemaking is highly specialized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to remove any doubt about using 28-foot beverage semitrailers with an upper coupler plate that extends beyond
the front of the semitrailer on the NN without a special permit, the FHWA is designating them as specialized equipment
pursuant to our authority under section 411(d) of the STAA (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This designation as specialized equipment applies only to van-type, drop-frame, side-loading only, beverage semitrailers
for which the upper coupler plate extends beyond the front of the semitrailer, and the distance from the centerline
of the kingpin connection to the rear of the semitrailer is not greater than 28 feet. The rule preempts States from imposing
an overall length limit on such vehicles operating in semitrailer or double trailer combinations and guarantees
these truck tractor-single beverage semitrailer combinations the same access to points of loading and unloading
as 28-foot (28.5-foot if grandfathered) semitrailers in 23 CFR 658.19. After reviewing the comments to the docket,
the FHWA has concluded that this action would allow for a productivity gain without adversely effecting public safety.
A definition of beverage semitrailer has been added to &sect;658.5, and regulatory language has been added to &sect;658.13.
This action concludes the FHWA rulemaking proceeding that was designated with the regulation identification number
2125&hyph;AC57.

As implemented by 23 CFR 657.13, 23 U.S.C. 141(b) requires each State to certify annually that it is enforcing its size
and weight laws on the Federal-aid Primary System (FAP), Federal-aid Urban System (FAU), Federal-aid Secondary
System (FAS), and the Interstate System in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 127.

Under the new ISTEA provision, States must also certify that they are enforcing and complying with the ISTEA freeze
on the use of LCV's and other multi-unit vehicles. Failure to certify would subject a State to the penalties provided
in 23 U.S.C. 141(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA, however, effectively replaced the FAP with the NHS, and eliminated the FAU and FAS Systems, without providing
a conforming amendment to 23 U.S.C. 141(b). Until 23 U.S.C. 141 is amended to reflect changes in system nomenclature,
the FHWA will require the States to certify size and weight enforcement on those routes which, prior to October 1, 1991,
were designated as part of the FAP, FAS, or FAU Systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Alaska objected to the certification statement proposed in the SNPRM. That statement would require the
State to certify that it is enforcing the freeze provisions of 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and that its State laws are consistent
with 23 U.S.C. 127 (a) and (b). Alaska asserts that section 127 does not apply to the State because the State does not
have any Interstate System mileage as defined in 23 U.S.C. 103, 139(a) or 139(b). The FHWA agrees with this comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same situation with respect to highway system also exists in Puerto Rico, which is considered a ``State'' for the
purposes of title 23, United States Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification language proposed by the SNPRM has been retained, except that language to recognize the situations
in Alaska and Puerto Rico has also been included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language describing size and weight enforcement coverage in urban areas has also been clarified in this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since its initial publication in 1980 (45 FR 52365), &sect;657.15 has required that ``Urban areas not subject to State
jurisdiction shall be identified and the statement shall address total (Federal-aid) mileage involved and an analysis
of enforcement efforts in such areas.'' In practice, the FHWA's interpretation of this requirement over the years
has been to focus on those areas over 50,000 population, also called urbanized areas (as determined by the Bureau of
the Census). The FHWA recognizes an area as ``urban'' when the population is 5,000 or more. It is not now, nor has it ever
been, the intent of the FHWA to require extensive size and weight enforcement activities, or an analysis thereof,
in areas with a population between 5,000 and 50,000. The intent of this requirement has always been to ensure that an
adequate size and weight enforcement effort be conducted by larger cities, i.e., over 50,000 population, where the
State weight enforcement agency does not have legal jurisdiction. Substitution of the word ``urbanized'' for ``urban''
(both terms as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101) in the second sentence of &sect;657.15(b) accomplishes this clarification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What, prior to October 1, 1991, was Federal-aid system mileage in urban areas of less than 50,000 population, should
continue to be covered by the State's overall weight enforcement program. This change in wording does not preclude,
nor should it discourage, weight enforcement activity by local jurisdictions. Such activity is encouraged with
results to be reported as part of the overall enforcement activity in the State.

Conforming Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ISTEA section 4006(c) consisted of a conforming amendment as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 411(e)(1) of such Act (the STAA of 1982) is amended by striking ``those Primary System highways'' and inserting
``those highways of the Federal-aid primary system in existence on June 1, 1991 *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 411(e)(1) of the STAA describes the type of highways that the Secretary shall designate as open to the vehicles
described by the STAA. These designated highways, in combination with the Interstate System, have come to be known
as the NN. The ISTEA effectively replaced what had been known as the FAP System with the NHS. This conforming amendment
corrects the technical problem of designating segments of a highway system (the FAP) which no longer exists. The necessary
corrections to the definitions of ``Federal-aid Primary System'' and ``National Network,'' both found in 23 CFR
658.5, have been made by this final rule.

This final rule implements sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA, which restrict the operation of LCV's on the Interstate
Highway System and CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN to the type of vehicles in use on
or before June 1, 1991, subject to whatever State rules, regulations, or restrictions were in effect on that date.

As noted in the following paragraphs, the FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is: (1) Not a significant regulatory
action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866; (2) not a significant action within the meaning of Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities; (4) does not require the preparation of a federalism assessment; and (5) does not require
the preparation of an environmental impact statement. All of these findings were made and included in the NPRM and
again in the SNPRM, in each case after the FHWA had carefully reviewed the applicable Federal statutes and Executive
Orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA submitted comments to the docket in response to both the NPRM and the SNPRM challenging what it saw as the FHWA's
casual dismissal of determinations required by various statutes and Executive Orders. In comments on the NPRM, the
WTA argued that a long-term effect of any freeze would be to prohibit the natural evolution of technology in the trucking
industry. Such a situation, in turn, would be likely to cause major and significant impacts on competing transportation
modes, related businesses, and the general public. Accordingly, the WTA insisted that the FHWA conduct (1) a full
regulatory evaluation, (2) a full economic assessment, (3) a federalism assessment, and (4) an environmental impact
study.

After undertaking the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA reiterated
in the SNPRM its conclusion that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This conclusion remains unchanged in this final rule. The WTA, responding to an earlier document,
stated that ``there is no question that the form and substance of this NPRM are clearly harmful to small entities. Most
businesses affected in Wyoming are small entities. The few large entities doing business in Wyoming are similarly
adversely affected.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule in no way restricts the ability of small entities to enter the LCV segment of the motor carrier industry. The
LCV segment of the industry can expand as rapidly as it finds customers. Neither the rule nor any State affected by the
rule limits the number of LCV's that may be placed in service, or the number of motor carriers that may operate them.
The rule does not reduce the highway network on which carriers may run LCV's; it simply lists the routes where the States
have decided very large vehicles can operate without seriously damaging pavements and bridges. In Wyoming, that
amounts to every NN route in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WTA seems to be demanding, not better regulatory analyses, but something like a full-scale econometric model
of the transportation segment of the economy. The WTA apparently believes that such a model, when run, would demonstrate
that the ISTEA freeze is likely to change the competitive balance between railroad and highway transportation, retard
the technological development of trucks, reduce employment in the motor carrier industry, and raise freight costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the LCV freeze includes all State routes currently in use, and because we are not aware that any State wishes
to expand its LCV network, we expect that the freeze will have none of the effects predicted by the WTA, at least in the
short term. The FHWA believes that the ``frozen'' LCV Network offers ample opportunity for reasonable growth. Insufficient
data exist to evaluate the possible longer-term effects of this rulemaking, and any conclusions presented here would
be speculative in nature.

.) (NEPA), the FHWA has twice found that it would have no effect on the quality of the environment. The WTA disagreed:
``A rule which dictates increased use of fuels, a scarce natural resource, affects the quality of the environment
in a negative fashion.'' The rule does not dictate increased use of fuels. If LCV's move freight at a lower fuel or emission
cost per ton/mile than other motor vehicles, as the WTA appears to believe, the rule would not prevent LCV's from displacing
less efficient vehicles. The FHWA sees no reason to change its conclusion.

As discussed earlier, this final rule makes two technical amendments to appendix A, 23 CFR part 658, which lists federally-designated
routes on the NN. These changes would amend the listings for California, to reflect the inclusion of the I&hyph;580
Richmond-San Rafael Bridge in the NN, and also for Virginia, to reflect that State's new milepost-based exit numbering
system. For the reasons set forth earlier in this document, the FHWA has determined that prior notice and opportunity
for comment are not required for either amendment under the U.S. Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies
and Procedures, as it is not anticipated that such action will result in the receipt of useful information.

of a federalism assessment. Although its effect will be to prevent the expansion of the ISTEA vehicle network beyond
that which States allowed on June 1, 1991, that is a direct result of the underlying statute. Moreover, there is no indication
at this time that the States planned any significant expansion of that network which would be impeded by this requirement.

 No State shall impose a length limit on a maxi-cube vehicle, as defined in &sect;658.5 of this part, of less than 34 feet
on either cargo box, excluding drawbar or hitching device; 60 feet on the distance from the front of the first to the
rear of the second cargo box, including the space between the cargo boxes; or 65 feet on the overall length of the combination,
including the space between the cargo boxes. The measurement for compliance with the 60- and 65-foot distance shall
include the actual distance between cargo boxes, measured along the centerline of the drawbar or hitching device.
For maxi-cubes with an adjustable length drawbar or hitching device, the 60- and 65-foot distances shall be measured
with a drawbar spacing of not more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that distance to maneuver
or load the vehicle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) A beverage semitrailer is specialized equipment if it has an upper coupler plate that extends beyond the front
of the semitrailer, but not beyond its swing radius, as measured from the center line of the kingpin to a front corner
of the semitrailer, which cannot be used for carrying cargo other than the structure of the semitrailer, and with the
center line of the kingpin not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer (exclusive of rear-mounted devices
not measured in determining semitrailer length). No State shall impose an overall length limit on such vehicles when
operating in a truck tractor-beverage semitrailer or truck tractor-beverage semitrailer-beverage trailer combination
on the NN.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Truck tractor-beverage semitrailer combinations shall have the same access to points of loading and unloading

(f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000
pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum
of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 pounds per
inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit
steering axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established by the manufacturer, whichever is
lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The weights in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall be inclusive of all tolerances, enforcement
or otherwise, with the exception of a scale allowance factor when using portable scales (wheel-load weighers). The
current accuracy of such scales is generally within 2 or 3 percent of actual weight, but in no case shall an allowance
in excess of 5 percent be applied. Penalty or fine schedules which impose no fine up to a specified threshold, i.e.,
1,000 pounds, will be considered as tolerance provisions not authorized by 23 U.S.C. 127. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) States may issue special permits without regard to the axle, gross, or Federal Bridge Formula requirements for
nondivisible vehicles or loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply to single-, or tandem-axle weights,
or gross weights legally authorized under State law on July 1, 1956. The group of axles requirements established in
this section shall not apply to vehicles legally grandfathered under State groups of axles tables or formulas on January
4, 1975. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section shall not apply to the operation on Interstate Route
68 in Allegany and Garrett Counties, Maryland, of any specialized vehicle equipped with a steering axle and a tridem
axle and used for hauling coal, logs, and pulpwood if such vehicle is of a type of vehicle as was operating in such counties
on U.S. Routes 40 or 48 for such purposes on August 1, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Beginning October 6, 1992, and ending October 5, 1994, the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section
shall not apply to any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger
bus. The Secretary may extend this temporary exemption for an additional year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. In &sect;658.19, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access to vehicles with dimensions authorized by the STAA
between the NN and terminals and facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest. In addition, no State may enact or enforce
any law denying reasonable access between the NN and points of loading and unloading to household goods carriers,
motor carriers of passengers, and any truck tractor-semitrailer combination in which the semitrailer has a length
not to exceed 28 feet (28.5 feet where allowed pursuant to &sect;658.13(b)(5) of this part) and which generally operates
as part of a vehicle combination described in &sect;&sect;658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a) of this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;658.23 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

LCV freeze; cargo-carrying unit freeze. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and except for tow trucks with vehicles in tow, a State may allow
the operation of LCV's on the Interstate System only as listed in appendix C to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a State may not allow the operation on the NN of any CMV combination
with two or more cargo-carrying units (not including the truck tractor) whose cargo-carrying units exceed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The maximum combination trailer, semitrailer, or other type of length limitation authorized by State law or regulation
of that State on or before June 1, 1991; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The length of the cargo-carrying units of those CMV combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful
operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in that State on or before June
1, 1991, as listed in appendix C to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying
units may operate on the NN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations with a maximum
length of the individual cargo units of 28.5 feet or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Vehicles described in &sect;658.13(e) and (g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Truck tractor-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer combinations with an overall length of 65 feet or less.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Maxi-cubes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Tow trucks with vehicles in tow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For specific safety purposes and road construction, a State may make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency
nature to route designations and vehicle operating restrictions applicable to combinations subject to sections
1023 and 4006 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;240 and in effect on June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991, for Alaska). Adjustments which last
30 days or less may be made without notifying the FHWA. Minor adjustments which exceed 30 days require approval of the
FHWA. When such adjustments are needed, a State must submit to the Division Office of Motor Carriers, by the end of the
30th day, a written description of the emergency, the date on which it began, and the date on which it is expected to conclude.
If the adjustment involves route designations, the State shall describe the new route on which vehicles otherwise
subject to the freeze imposed by sections 1023 and 4006 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;240 are allowed to operate. To the extent
possible, the geometric and pavement design characteristics of the alternate route should be equivalent to those
of the highway section which is temporarily unavailable. Approval or disapproval by Office of Motor Carriers officials
of adjustments involving route designations shall be coordinated with the Division Administrator. If the adjustment
involves vehicle operating restrictions, the State shall list the restrictions that have been removed or modified.
Approval or disapproval of the adjustment by the Division Office of Motor Carriers shall take place only after consultation
with the Regional Office of Motor Carriers. If the adjustment is approved, a copy of the approved submission shall
be forwarded through the Regional Office of Motor Carriers, to the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers at
Headquarters, who will publish the notice of adjustment, with an expiration date, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Requests for extensions of time beyond the originally established conclusion date shall be subject to the same approval
and publication process as the original request. If upon consultation with the Regional Office of Motor Carriers,
a decision is reached that minor adjustments made by a State are not legitimately attributable to road or bridge construction
or safety, the Division Office of Motor Carriers will so inform the State, and the original conditions of the freeze
must be reimposed immediately. Failure to do so may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.

(e) States further restricting or prohibiting the operation of vehicles subject to sections 1023 and 4006 of Public
Law 102&hyph;240 after June 1, 1991, shall notify the FHWA Division Office of Motor Carriers within 30 days after the
restriction is effective. The Division Office of Motor Carriers shall forward the information through the Regional
Office of Motor Carriers to the Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers at Headquarters. The FHWA will publish
the restriction in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 as an amendment to appendix C to this part. Failure to provide such notification may subject the State to a penalty pursuant
to 23 U.S.C. 141. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Federal Highway Administrator, on his or her own motion or upon a request by any person (including a State),
shall review the information set forth in appendix C to this part. If the Administrator determines there is cause to
believe that a mistake was made in the accuracy of the information contained in appendix C to this part, the Administrator
shall commence a proceeding to determine whether the information published should be corrected. If the Administrator
determines that there is a mistake in the accuracy of the information contained in appendix C to this part, the Administrator
shall publish in the

This appendix contains the weight and size provisions that were in effect on or before June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991 for
Alaska), for vehicles covered by 23 U.S.C. 127(d) (LCV's) and 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j) (commercial motor vehicles (CMV's)
with 2 or more cargo-carrying units). Weights and dimensions are ``frozen'' at the values shown here, which were in
effect on June 1, 1991 (Alaska, July 6, 1991). All vehicles are listed by configuration type.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the State-by-State descriptions, CMV combinations which can also be LCV's are identified with the letters ``LCV''
following the type of combination vehicle. The maximum allowable gross vehicle weight is given in this appendix (in
thousands of pounds indicated by a ``K''), as well as information summarizing the operational conditions, routes,
and legal citations. The term ``Interstate System'' as used herein refers to the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate
and Defense Highways.

Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Listed for each State by combination type is either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The maximum cargo-carrying length (shown in feet); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A notation that such vehicle is not allowed (indicated by a ``NO''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMV's are categorized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and two trailing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and three trailing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units not included in descriptions 1 or 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the following table the top number is the maximum cargo-carrying length measured in feet from the front of the first
cargo unit to the rear of the last cargo unit. This distance is not to include length exclusive devices which have been
approved by the Secretary or by any State. Devices excluded from length determination shall only include items whose
function is related to the safe and efficient operation of the semitrailer or trailer. No device excluded from length
determination shall be designed or used for carrying cargo. The number below the length measurement is the maximum
gross weight in thousands of pounds that the type of vehicle can carry when operating as an LCV on the Interstate System.
For every State where there is a length or weight number in the table that follows, additional information is provided.

(3)_No maximum cargo-carrying length is established for this combination. Because State law limits each trailing
unit to not more than 28.5 feet in length, this combination is allowed to operate on all NN routes under the authority
of the STAA of 1982, regardless of actual cargo-carrying length. The maximum weight listed is New Mexico's maximum
allowable gross weight on the Interstate System under the grandfather authority of 23 U.S.C. 127.

ACCESS: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A vehicle shall not be operated off the designated portions of the Interstate System except to access food, fuel, repairs,
and rest or to access a facility. Access to a facility shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The facility must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Be either a manufacturing or a distribution center, a warehouse, or truck terminal located in an area where industrial
uses are permitted;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Be a construction site; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Meet the following criteria:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
adequate off-roadway space exists on the premises to safely maneuver the vehicles; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
adequate equipment is available on the premises to handle, load, and unload the vehicle, its trailers, and cargo.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The facility must be located within a maximum distance of 10 miles from the point where the vehicle enters or exits
the designated portions of the Interstate System. Such 10-mile distance shall be measured by the actual route(s)
to be traveled to the facility, rather than by a straight line radius from the designated Interstate System to the facility;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The access route(s) between the designated Interstate System and the facility must be approved in advance by the
public entity (Colorado DOT, municipality, or county) having jurisdiction for the roadway(s) that make up the route(s).
Where the State of Colorado has jurisdiction over the access route(s), it will consider the following safety, engineering,
and other criteria in determining whether to approve the route(s):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Safety of the motoring public;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Geometrics of the street and roadway;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Traffic volumes and patterns;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Protection of State highways, roadways, and structures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Zoning and general characteristics of the route(s) to be encountered; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Other relevant criteria warranted by special circumstances of the proposed route(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local entities, counties, and municipalities having jurisdiction over route(s), should consider similar criteria
in determining whether to approve the proposed ingress and egress route(s); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A permit holder shall access only the facility or location authorized by the permit. If the permit authorizes more
than one facility or location, then on any single trip by an LVC from the designated Interstate System the permit holder
may access only one facility or location before returning to the designated Interstate System.

OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: The operations of triple trailing unit combinations are governed by two sets of criteria:
(1) The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules, and (2) the SVC rules which apply off of the Turnpike except in the case of
vehicles operating under Turnpike access authority. The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules allow a maximum combination
vehicle length of 119 feet overall. The SVC rules require ``Triples'' to have trailers of no more than 28.5 feet maximum
length or a cargo-carrying length of approximately 95 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules have no time-of-day travel restrictions or other special requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SVC rules have several operational conditions. SVC's cannot operate on holidays or during holiday weekends.
SVC's cannot be dispatched or operated during adverse weather conditions. SVC's must travel in the right lane, except
for passing, and the following distance is 100 feet for every 10 miles per hour. SVC permits can include any restrictions
deemed necessary, including specific routes and hours, days, and/or seasons of operation. Rules and regulations
can be promulgated regarding driver qualifications, vehicle equipment, and operational standards.

 The following information pertains to tandem trailer combinations with either trailer more than 28.5 feet long but
not more than 48 feet long. A nine-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 143,000 pounds.
An eight-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 138,400 pounds. The maximum gross
weight that may be carried upon any combination of units is limited by the maximum gross weight that can be carried upon
the axles as follows. For a nine-axle combination: Drive axles_36,000 pounds, axles four/five_36,000 pounds, axles

Dollies. Every converter dolly certified on and after June 1, 1968, used to convert a semitrailer to a full trailer
may have either single or tandem axles at the option of the permittee. Single-axle dollies may not utilize low profile
tires. Combination vehicles with a gross weight in excess of 138,400 pounds must have a tandem-axle dolly to meet the
nine-axle requirement. If the distance between two semitrailers is 10 feet or more, the dolly shall be equipped with
a device or the trailers connected along the sides with suitable material to indicate they are in effect one unit. The
devices or connection shall be approved by the NYSTA prior to use on a tandem trailer combination. The NYSTA tandem-trailer
provisions require that converter dollies shall be coupled with one or more safety chains or cables to the frame or
an extension of the frame of the motor vehicle by which it is towed. Each dolly converter must also be equipped with mud
flaps. Tandem combinations using a sliding fifth wheel attached to the lead trailer, known as a ``B-Train'' combination,
will require a separate Thruway Engineer Service approval prior to the initial tandem run. Special provisions regarding
B-Trains will be reviewed at the time of the application or request for use on the Thruway.

The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement, be over 26 years of age, in good
health, and shall have not less than 5 years of experience driving tractor-trailer or tractor-short double trailer
motor vehicles. Such driving experience shall include experience throughout the four seasons. Drivers must comply
with the applicable current requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, Federal Hazardous Materials
Regulations, and the Economic and Safety regulations of the Ohio Public Utility Commission.

Vehicles being operated under permit at night must be equipped with all lights and reflectors required by the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, except that the trailer shall be equipped
with two red tail lights and two red or amber stop lights mounted with one set on each side. Trailer and semitrailer length
for doubles cannot exceed 48 feet, and mixed trailer length combinations are not allowed for combination vehicles
over 90 feet in length. Combined cargo-carrying length, including the trailer hitch, cannot be less than 80 feet or
more than 102 feet. The number of axles on a double shall be a minimum of five and a maximum of nine. A tractor used in the
operation of a double shall be capable of hauling the maximum weight at a speed of not less than 40 miles per hour on all
portions of the Turnpike.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PERMIT: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A special permit is required if the vehicle is over 102 inches wide, 14 feet high, or 65 feet in length including overhang.
Tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer combinations require a permit if over 75 feet in length, excluding an allowed
3-foot front overhang and a 4-foot rear overhang. For vehicles over 120 inches wide, 14 feet high, or 80 feet long or
if any unit of the combination vehicle is over 60 feet in length, travel is restricted to daylight hours Monday through
noon Saturday, except holidays and the day before and after holidays. Operators are restricted to daylight driving
if the load overhang is more than 4 feet. A ``Long Double Trailer Permit'' issued by the OTC is required for operation
of doubles in excess of 90 feet in length. Towing units and coupling devices shall have sufficient structural strength
to ensure safe operation. Vehicles and coupling devices shall be so designed, constructed, and installed in a double
as to ensure that any towed vehicles when traveling on a level, smooth paved surface will follow in the path of the towing
vehicle without shifting or swerving more than 3 inches to either side of the path of the towing vehicle when the latter
is moving in a straight line. Vehicle coupling devices and brakes shall meet the requirements of the Ohio Public Utilities
Commission and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The distance between the rearmost axle of a semitrailer
and the front axle of the next semitrailer in a coupled double unit shall not exceed 12 feet 6 inches. In no event shall
the distance between the semitrailers coupled in a double exceed 9 feet. Double and triple trailer combinations must
be equipped with adequate, properly maintained spray-suppressant mud flaps on all axles except the steering axle.
In the event that the gross weights of the trailers vary by more than 20 percent, they shall be coupled according to their
gross weights with the heavier trailer forward. A minimum distance of 500 feet shall be maintained between double
units and/or triple units except when overtaking and passing another vehicle. A double shall remain in the right-hand,
outside lane except when passing or when emergency or work-zone conditions exist. When, in the opinion of the OTC,
the weather conditions are such that operation of a double is inadvisable, the OTC will notify the permittee that travel
is prohibited for a certain period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class A and B explosives; Class A poisons; and Class 1, 2, and 3 radioactive material cannot be transported in double
trailer combinations. Other hazardous materials may be transported in one trailer of a double. The hazardous materials
should be placed in the front trailer unless doing so will result in the second trailer weighing more than the first
trailer.

caused by snow, wind, ice, sleet, fog, mist, rain, dust, or smoke. When conditions become sufficiently dangerous
as determined by the company or driver, operations shall be discontinued and shall not resume until the vehicle can
be safely operated. The State may restrict or prohibit operations during periods when, in the State's judgment, traffic,
weather, or other safety conditions make such operations unsafe or inadvisable.

For a combination which includes a truck tractor and two trailing units, the lead trailing unit (semitrailer) may
be up to 40 feet long. The second trailing unit may be up to 35 feet long. However, the primary control is the total cargo-carrying
distance which has a maximum length of 68 feet. Any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety chains
or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must
have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with
no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling
if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.

A permit is required for operation if the gross combination weight exceeds 80,000 pounds. A fee is charged. Permitted
movements must have the lighter trailing unit placed to the rear, and use splash and spray devices when operating in
rainy weather. Movement is not allowed when road surfaces are hazardous due to ice or snow, or when other atmospheric
conditions make travel unsafe.

 For all combinations, the maximum gross weight on two or more consecutive axles is limited by the Federal Bridge Formula
but cannot exceed 129,000 pounds. The weight on single axles or tandem axles spaced 40 inches or less apart may not exceed
20,000 pounds. Tandem axles spaced more than 40 inches but 96 inches or less may not exceed 34,000 pounds. Two consecutive
sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and
last axles of the tandems is 36 feet or more. The weight on the steering axle may not exceed 600 pounds per inch of tire
width. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 81.5 feet the following additional regulations also
apply. The weight on all axles (other than the steering axle) may not exceed 500 pounds per inch of tire width. Lift axles
and belly axles are not considered load-carrying axles and will not count when determining allowable vehicle weight.

 For all combinations, a semitrailer or trailer may neither be longer than nor weigh 3,000 pounds more than the trailer
located immediately in front of it. Towbars longer than 19 feet must be flagged during daylight hours and lighted at
night. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 81.5 feet or less, neither trailer may exceed 45 feet, including
load overhang. Vehicles may be 12 feet wide when hauling baled feed during daylight hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combinations with a cargo-carrying length over 81.5 feet long, neither trailer may exceed 48 feet, including
load overhang. Loading the rear of the trailer heavier than the front is not allowed. All axles except the steering
axle require dual tires. Axles spaced 8 feet or less apart must weigh within 500 pounds of each other. The trailer hitch
offset may not exceed 6 feet. The maximum effective rear trailer overhang may not exceed 35 percent of the trailer's
wheelbase. The power unit must have sufficient power to maintain 40 miles per hour. A ``LONG LOAD'' sign measuring
18 inches high by 7 feet long with black on yellow lettering 10 inches high is required on the rear. Offtracking is limited
to 8.75 feet for a turning radius of 161 feet.

All braking systems must comply with State and Federal requirements. In addition, fast air transmission and release
valves must be provided on all semitrailer and converter-dolly axles. A brake force limiting valve, sometimes called
a ``slippery road'' valve, may be provided on the steering axle. Anti-sail type mud flaps are recommended.

When traveling on a level, smooth paved surface, the trailing units must follow in the path of the towing vehicle without
shifting or swerving more than 3 inches to either side when the towing vehicle is moving in a straight line. Each combination
shall maintain a minimum distance of 500 feet from another commercial vehicle traveling in the same direction on the
same highway. Loads shall be securely fastened to the transporter with material and devices of sufficient strength
to prevent the load from becoming loose, detached, dangerously displaced, or in any manner a hazard to other highway
users. The components of the load shall be reinforced or bound securely in advance of travel to prevent debris from
being blown off the unit and endangering the safety of the traveling public. Any debris from the special permit vehicle
deposited on the highway shall be removed by the permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Permits must be purchased. The Utah DOT Motor Carrier Safety Division will, on submission of an LCV permit request,
assign an investigator to perform an audit on the carrier, which must have an established safety program that is in
compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR parts 387&hyph;399), the Federal Hazardous
Materials Regulations (49 CFR parts 171&hyph;178), and a ``Satisfactory'' safety rating. The request must show
a travel plan for the operation of the vehicles. Permits are subject to Highway Patrol supervision and permitted vehicles
may be subject to temporary delays or removed from the highways when necessary during hazardous road, weather, or
traffic conditions. The permit will be cancelled without refund if violated. Expiration dates cannot be extended
except for reasons beyond the control of the permittee, including adverse weather. Permits are void if defaced, modified,
or obliterated. Lost or destroyed permits cannot be duplicated and are not transferable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is finalizing its interim rule on Use of Force and Application of Restraints, which was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 May 17, 1989 (54 FR 21394). A summary of the public comment and agency response follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau received comment regarding paragraphs (c), (e), (f), (g), and (j) of &sect;552.21, and on &sect;&sect;552.22
and 552.23. With respect to &sect;552.21(c), the commenter stated that there was a lack of specificity as to which
institutional regulations could be enforced by the use of restraints and/or force. The Bureau believes, however,
that the general guidelines and statement of purpose in revised &sect;552.20 (discussed below) and the governing
principles contained in newly designated &sect;552.22 adequately acknowledge the serious nature of conditions
which authorize the use of force and/or restraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(e), the commenter stated that the lifting and carrying of an inmate in restraints could
expose the inmate to both malicious and unintentional physical harm by those prison staff carrying the inmate. The
commenter further stated that such lifting might also expose staff to injury, and stated that no prisoners should
be dragged nor should inmates be enlisted for the purpose of lifting or carrying a restrained inmate because they have
not had appropriate training. The Bureau believes that newly designated &sect;552.22(h) clearly prohibits the
infliction of malicious harm. In addition, appropriate training on the use of force and/or restraints and on the lifting
and carrying of an inmate in restraints is provided to Bureau staff. The Bureau believes that this training is sufficient
to address the commenter's concerns on minimizing the risk of unintentional physical harm to either inmate or staff.
Finally, the Bureau wishes to note that its regulations on the use of force and/or restraints are implemented by staff
and not by inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(f), the commenter objected to the absence of any reference to maximum time length allowed
on the use of restraints. The commenter further noted that medical staff should be consulted when the inmate ``is unable
to regain his or her self-control within a normal time'' and for determining whether continued use of restraints is
necessary. The Bureau believes that adequate provision for medical review and/or continuing care is contained in
newly designated &sect;552.26. As noted below, the Bureau is making further amendment to its provisions for the role
of medical staff in use of force and application of restraints incidents.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(g), the commenter questioned the use of restraints on an inmate in administrative detention
or disciplinary segregation. The Bureau notes that this paragraph (now designated as &sect;552.22(g)) states that,
except when the immediate use of restraints is required for the control of the inmate, application or continued application
of restraints on an inmate in administrative detention or disciplinary segregation requires the approval of Warden
or designee. The Bureau wishes to note that such application would not be routine, and it believes that requiring approval
at this level is sufficient to ensure that such application does accomplish legitimate penological objectives.
As noted below, the Bureau is making further amendments to this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.21(j), the commenter noted a discrepancy in that this paragraph provided that all significant
incidents involving use of force and application of restraints require documentation, while &sect;522.26 stated
that all incidents involving use of force or restraints be documented. As noted below, newly designated &sect;552.22(j)
is being amended to remove this unintentional discrepancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.22, the commenter objected to exception being made by the Director for use of confrontation
avoidance procedures in specific institutions or housing units. As noted below, this section (now designated as
&sect;552.23) is being revised to remove stated exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to &sect;552.23, the commenter stated that with the exception of preventing inmate self-injury, it
is never necessary to implement four-point restraints. The commenter noted particular objection to paragraph (e),
stating that it allows prison staff to deny the inmate in four-point restraints an opportunity to use the toilet if
he or she continued to resist or became violent while being released. The commenter believed that any self-destructive
behavior exhibited by an inmate in four-point restraint should be reported to medical staff and that control over
the use of four-point restraint by medical personnel is essential. The Bureau believes that this section contains
sufficient safeguards. As noted below, however, this section (now designated as &sect;552.24) is being further
amended for editorial purposes. The Bureau believes that the editorial restatement of the introductory text clarifies
that four-point restraints are to be used when it is determined that they are the only means available to obtain and
maintain control over an inmate. The provisions in paragraph (e) are intended to guarantee that the inmate's access
to toilet facilities are controlled by the inmate's behavior. The Bureau believes that newly designated &sect;&sect;552.24(f)
and 552.26 adequately provide for medical review and responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After due consideration of the comments received, and based upon the experience gained from application of the previously
revised regulations, the Bureau makes the following further amendments. For the sake of clarity, the provisions
in former &sect;552.20 are being revised into two separate sections, and former &sect;&sect;552.21 through 552.26
are redesignated as &sect;&sect;552.22 through 552.27 in order to accommodate the new section. Paragraph codification
and cross references in the revised regulations have been adjusted as necessary. In &sect;552.20, the introductory
text (formerly paragraph (a)) is further amended to include a statement that staff are authorized to use force only
as a last alternative after all other reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. Paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this section (formerly paragraphs (a) (1) and (2)) are amended for editorial purposes. In paragraph (d) (formerly
paragraph (a)(4)) the word ``wounds'' is revised to read ``injury'' to describe more accurately conditions which
may lead to authorized use of restraints by staff. Because an injury may be of such a nature that it would not by strict
definition be considered a wound, the Bureau believes it reasonable to use the broader word ``injury.'' In new &sect;552.21
on types of force, section headings were added to paragraphs (c) and (d) for the sake of editorial consistency. In addition,
paragraph (c) (formerly &sect;552.20(d)) is amended to include reference to soft and ambulatory (leg) restraints.
The use of soft restraints and ambulatory restraints is intended to allow for graduated procedures in applying restraints.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In newly designated &sect;552.22, paragraph (a) is amended to remove an obsolete cross reference, and paragraph
(g) is amended to include reference to graduated procedures in applying restraints. In paragraph (h), introductory
text is amended to include an example of restraint equipment, and paragraph (h)(2) is amended to clarify specific
situations to help avoid physical problems of an inmate under restraints. Paragraph (j) is amended to remove any inconsistency
with the provisions of newly designated &sect;522.27. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.23 is revised to broaden the use of confrontation avoidance procedures. To this effect,
paragraph (b), which contained provisions for exception, is removed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In newly designated &sect;552.24, introductory text is amended to further clarify when four-point restraints may
be used. In paragraph (a), ``vinyl'' is substituted for ``leather.'' Additional editorial amendments to this section
make no change in the intent of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.25 is amended for editorial purposes. There is no change in the intent of the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.26 is revised to specify the role of medical staff in calculated use of force situations.
Paragraph (a) is also amended to include provisions specifically applicable to pregnant inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly designated &sect;552.27 is reworded, although its intent is unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau believes that the changes to the interim rule discussed above do not impose additional restrictions on
inmates and are necessary in order to provide for the continued protection of inmates, staff, and property. The Bureau
therefore finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring
notice of further proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date for these
additional changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866;
this rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to E.O. 12866. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

3. Section 552.20 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;552.20 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose and scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Prisons authorizes staff to use force only as a last alternative after all other reasonable efforts to
resolve a situation have failed. When authorized, staff must use only that amount of force necessary to gain control
of the inmate, to protect and ensure the safety of inmates, staff, and others, to prevent serious property damage and
to ensure institution security and good order. Staff are authorized to apply physical restraints necessary to gain
control of an inmate who appears to be dangerous because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The inmate assaults another individual; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The inmate destroys government property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The inmate attempts suicide; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The inmate inflicts injury upon self; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The inmate becomes violent or displays signs of imminent violence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule on application of restraints does not restrict the use of restraints in situations requiring precautionary
restraints, particularly in the movement or transfer of inmates (e.g., the use of handcuffs in moving inmates to and
from a cell in detention, escorting an inmate to a Special Housing Unit pending investigation, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A new &sect;552.21 is added to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;552.21 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Types of force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Immediate use of force.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Staff may immediately use force and/or apply restraints when the behavior described in &sect;552.20 constitutes
an immediate, serious threat to the inmate, staff, others, property, or to institution security and good order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculated use of force and/or application of restraints.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This occurs in situations where an inmate is in an area that can be isolated (e.g., a locked cell, a range) and where there
is no immediate, direct threat to the inmate or others. When there is time for the calculated use of force or application
of restraints, staff must first determine if the situation can be resolved without resorting to force (see &sect;552.23).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of Force Team Technique.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If use of force is determined to be necessary, and other means of gaining control of an inmate are deemed inappropriate
or ineffective, then the Use of Force Team Technique shall be used to control the inmate and to apply soft restraints,
to include ambulatory leg restraints. The Use of Force Team Technique ordinarily involves trained staff, clothed
in protective gear, who enter the inmate's area in tandem, each with a coordinated responsibility for helping achieve
immediate control of the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Any exception to this rule is prohibited, except where the facts and circumstances known to the staff member would
warrant a person with correctional experience to reasonably believe other action is necessary (as a last resort)
to prevent serious physical injury, or serious property damage which would immediately endanger the safety of staff,
inmates, or others.

Medical attention in use of force and application of restraints incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In immediate use of force situations, staff shall seek the assistance of mental health or medical staff upon gaining
physical control of the inmate. When possible, staff shall seek such assistance at the onset of the violent behavior.
In calculated use of force situations, guidance of medical staff (based on a review of the inmate's medical record)
will be sought by the use of force team leader to identify physical or mental problems. When mental health or medical
staff determine that an inmate requires continuing care, and particularly when the inmate to be restrained is pregnant,
the deciding staff shall assume responsibility for care of the inmate, to include possible admission to the institution
hospital or, in the case of a pregnant inmate, restraining her in other than a face down four-point position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After any use of force or forcible application of restraints, the inmate shall be examined by a member of the medical
staff, and any injuries noted, immediately treated.

Staff shall appropriately document all incidents involving the use of force, chemical agents, or non-lethal weapons.
Staff shall also document, in writing, the use of restraints on an inmate who becomes violent or displays signs of imminent
violence. A copy of the report shall be placed in the inmate's central file.

. Under this program, certain Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) are required to develop and submit a plan regarding vacancies
in units owned or operated by the PHA. Each plan will be required to include the elements specified in the statute and
this rule. In addition, assessment teams have conducted on-site assessments of the vacancy situations of known eligible
PHAs and may provide assistance to PHAs in developing their plans. The assistance available under this program is
intended to supplement other initiatives of the PHA that will reduce the rate of addressable vacancies in a PHA's inventory.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 21, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule to implement the Vacancy Reduction Program (program). The
program was authorized when section 510 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act added a new section
14(p) to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 14371) (1937 Act). Recently section 14(p) was amended by section
115 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act),
and funding was made available for the first time for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 14(p) requires any public housing agency (PHA) to participate in the program if the PHA has a vacancy rate that
exceeds twice the national average, is designated as troubled under section 6(j) of the 1937 Act, or has been placed
under a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of the 1937 Act. Each PHA participating in the program will be required
to develop a vacancy reduction plan that identifies vacant dwelling units in its inventory and the reasons for the
vacancies, and describes actions to be taken by the PHA for the following five years to eliminate the vacancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the vacancy situations of every participating PHA will be reviewed on-site by assessment teams consisting
of representatives of the Department, independent experts knowledgeable about vacancy problems and management
issues relating to public housing, and PHA officials. The assessment teams will submit recommendations to HUD and
the PHA, and, at the request of the PHA, may assist the PHA in preparing its vacancy reduction plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plans will be the basis for selecting those PHAs that will receive assistance under the program. For troubled PHAs,
funding of vacancy reduction activities will be contingent upon the PHA either making or providing reasonable assurances
of substantial progress in remedying any management deficiencies.

Use of Survey to Determine FY 1993 NOFA Threshold Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the proposed rule, all PHAs where existing data indicated the PHA met the statutory criteria for mandatory
participation in the program were surveyed. The results of the survey have been used to define the threshold factors
for the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and are discussed in greater detail in that NOFA. In addition, the Department has conducted assessments at PHAs that
the Department believes meet the threshold factors for the NOFA that is published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As explained in the NOFA, any PHA that meets the threshold factors and has not already been assessed should immediately
request an assessment by contacting the Department.

and miscellaneous comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The rule states that a PHA must participate in the program if a receiver has been appointed for the PHA. The term ``receiver''
should be clarified, in that HUD has taken actions against PHAs that have resulted in takeovers of programs or operations
from PHAs without necessarily having a court-appointed receiver. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term is statutory and refers to a receiver appointed by a Federal or State court under section 6(j)(3) of the United
States Housing Act of 1937; the term does not include other arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Benefits of the program should be available to a PHA that does not have a vacancy rate of twice the national average
only if the PHA fails the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) standard for vacancies (see 24 CFR
part 901). (PHADA) Similarly, program participation should be optional for troubled authorities that do not have
a vacancy rate twice the national average. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the commenter noted, using the PHMAP standard would require congressional action because the current statute
requires participation by PHAs that are troubled or for which receivers have been appointed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In defining the term ``vacant unit'', reference is made to an effective lease, which is defined in terms of an eligible
family being charged rent. However, because of utility allowances or zero income, many residents do not pay rent for
the units they occupy. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition requires that the family have a right to possession of the unit, in addition to being charged rent. The
calculation of the rent to be charged by a PHA takes into account income and any utility allowance. As noted by the commenter,
as a result of this calculation of rent, the PHA might not actually collect any money from the family having the right
to possess a unit (e.g., when the utility allowance equals or exceeds the total tenant payment). However, the lease
still obligates the tenant and includes a rental charge that, at least in part, is based on income. Therefore, the elements
of the definition are met, even though the actual amount collected by the PHA from the tenant is $0. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A PHA is required to participate in the program if it has a vacancy rate that is twice the national average, regardless
of the number of units in the PHA's inventory. Because the vacancy problems of small PHAs, especially, may be due to
lack of demand, participation in the program should be optional for PHAs with less than 250 units. (PHADA) For the first
year, program participation should be limited to PHAs with 500 or more units. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute does not discriminate among the causes of vacancies in establishing the participation requirements.
However, the extent of participation may be limited to providing documentation of lack of demand or proposals to deprogram
units. In awarding funding, the Department will concentrate on PHAs where there is a demand for housing, as reflected
in the terms of the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Furthermore, because smaller PHAs dependent on CIAP funding often have fewer resources to solve a vacancy problem,
these PHAs could realize substantial improvement of their vacancy statistics with a minimal increment of funding.
Thus, their selection for funding would serve the statutory purposes of the program, and their exclusion from the
initial round of funding could not be justified.

Response: Because current program funding is limited, the Department is concentrating on PHAs that are required
to participate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In the definition of ``vacant unit,'' the proposed rule does not specify a timeframe for determining the existence
of a vacancy. Similarly, in calculating a PHA's vacancy rate for purposes of determining program eligibility, the
proposed rule does not recognize any normal turnover time, such as the 20-day transition period allowed under PHMAP
Indicator 5. (LACHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that the vacancy rate of a PHA is fluid. However, for the purpose of determining eligibility
for the program, the Department has decided to use a snapshot approach, i.e., the number of units vacant at the PHA on
the appropriate date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Development of the Vacancy Reduction Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed rule provides a number of examples of project-specific activities to eliminate vacancies that a
PHA might include in its vacancy reduction plan. The number of examples should be expanded to include such activities
as unit redesign or conversion, site reconfiguration, security improvements, and density reductions. These additional
examples will serve to give a better idea of the range of acceptable activities. (CLPHA, CHA) Similarly, examples
of specific management improvements that should be encouraged include tenant screening, evictions, and marketing
and leasing efforts. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of these examples have been included in &sect;968.407(b)(3)(i) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If demolition or disposition are selected activities, HUD's review and approval process and replacement housing
requirements will make it very difficult for a PHA to provide the required schedule that forecasts when the selected
activities would be accomplished. (CLPHA, PHADA (similar comment for other HUD actions)) In addition, participating
PHAs need to be able to change their schedules for eliminating vacancies to reflect actual funding. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 968.407(b)(3)(ii) and 968.407(b)(8) have been revised to include language providing that, in developing
the required schedule, PHAs should specify action within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 days from HUD approval or other action, when progress is dependent on HUD action. In addition, a schedule may be revised
to reflect the adequacy of funding for proposed activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a PHA needs help in preparing the vacancy reduction plan, the assessment team should be required to assist in
the plan development, if requested by the PHA. The proposed rule does not make this assistance mandatory. (PHADA)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 968.410(d) has been changed to clarify that, if requested by the PHA, HUD will assist a PHA in preparing its
vacancy reduction plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The final rule should clarify that participating PHAs do not have to address each single vacant unit separately,
but should be permitted to group together vacant units by the cause of vacancy. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the statutory requirements, each vacant dwelling unit must be identified. However, vacant units
may be grouped together for purposes of explaining the reasons for the vacancies and proposed actions for eliminating
the vacancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The vacancy reduction plan should include information on turnover problems. (PHADA, AHA) The information should
include the number of units vacated and reoccupied during a defined period and any indication of whether the turnover
rate is changing. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new paragraph has been added to &sect;968.407(b) to require that a vacancy reduction plan include certain information
on a PHA's turnover rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A complete strategy needs to be developed that includes not just rehabilitation work, but tenant screening, eviction,
property management, and security measures, as well. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department and the statute contemplate a complete strategy. A PHA's vacancy reduction plan should include any
action to remove the unit from the PHA's inventory of vacant units, including management improvements in each of the
specific areas mentioned by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If funding will be on a ``first-come, first served'' basis, the sequence of assessment team visits should be by
public drawing in order to avoid charges of favoritism. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the NOFA published today, the Department has decided upon an approach that should provide some funding to all PHAs
that meet the eligibility criteria. Each eligible PHA that is a Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP)
agency will be funded fully for all eligible units and approved activities, because smaller PHAs dependent on CIAP
funding often have fewer resources to solve a vacancy problem. If sufficient funds are available, each PHA that is
a Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) agency will be funded fully; however, if there are not sufficient funds remaining,
each CGP agency will be awarded a pro rata share of the available funding. This pro rata share will be calculated by a
method, to be determined by HUD and announced in the NOFA, that will provide funding equitably to those agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the PHA already is required under PHMAP to have developed a plan to address its vacancy problem, the primary
purpose of the Vacancy Reduction Program assessment team should be a validation or critique of the PHA's existing
plan, rather than an independent assessment. The intent of the program is to encourage action, not further studies.
(PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute requires an on-site assessment of the vacancy situation of each participating PHA, and specifies what
is to be included in the PHA's vacancy reduction plan. To the extent that a PHA is able, the Department encourages the
PHA to use work that has been done in accordance with PHMAP requirements to comply with the requirements of this program.

(3) PHAs that lend a staff person to an assessment team should be reimbursed for the staff person's salary and benefits
during that assignment. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that the statutory provision allowing program funds to be used for travel and administrative
expenses of assessment teams, extends to PHA staff. Therefore, PHAs will be reimbursed for the salary and benefits
for any staff person that serves on an assessment team. However, this does not apply to staff members of the PHA that
is being assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Because the need for these funds is great, the Department should speed up the scheduling of assessments. (MCHA,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Funding of Vacancy Reduction Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HUD needs to clarify its position regarding the use of program funds for security improvements. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where units are vacant because of security problems, HUD will provide funding for physical security improvements,
such as improved locks, security screens, additional lighting, and site improvement. As part of management improvements,
HUD also will provide funding for security activities over a limited duration, if HUD determines that such funding
is likely to result in the reoccupancy and continued occupancy of vacant units. Examples of security activities that
could be funded as part of management improvements include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hiring of additional staff to coordinate the provision, by local government or other public and private entities,
of appropriate social services, such as drug education and treatment referral programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hiring of security guards, through individual employment contracts, or guard services, using competitive
proposal or small purchase procurement procedures, or contracting with a local police force for security that is
in addition to that required under the Cooperation Agreement. As a condition of employment, these security personnel
shall be required to meet all relevant State insurance, training, licensing, and other similar requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development and implementation of improved screening procedures for prospective residents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development of more timely and effective management techniques for dealing with disruptive residents and
drug-related crime; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Organization and training of unarmed voluntary resident patrols to work cooperatively with the local law
enforcement agencies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development and implementation of improved communication and coordination with local law enforcement agencies;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hiring of investigators to investigate drug-related crime in and around the developments or to provide evidence
relating to any such crime in any administrative or judicial proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The minimum housing standards that should be imposed for capital improvements funded under this program are the
modernization standards, not the Housing Quality Standards (HQS). Units renovated to the HQS often still need modernization.
(CLPHA) In addition, the minimum housing standards should be applied only to the inside of units improved under the
program, rather than to common areas and major structural items. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each work item funded under this program must be performed in compliance with modernization standards. However,
the vacancy reduction program is an occupancy program, and HQS is a minimum occupancy standard. The goal of the individual
work items (performed to modernization standards) is to bring the vacant units into an occupiable condition. Section
968.435 of this rule requires certification that affected vacant units will be brought into compliance with the HQS.
As applied in Section I.F(1)(b) of today's NOFA, only aspects of the HQS that pertain to the vacant unit directly are
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The decision on how to target the initial funding available under this program should be based on the survey responses
only and not on any existing data mentioned in the preamble of the proposed rule. (PHADA)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The survey responses were used to determine which PHAs surveyed have vacancy problems and the nature of their problems.
Eligibility and final decisions on funding will be based on submitted applications, including the vacancy reduction
plans, the number of eligible units, and the assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Funding should not be on a ``first-come, first-served'' basis, which rewards those able to act the quickest, but
should be awarded using a more traditional competitive approach. Criteria that should be used to make awards include:
PHA capacity and ability to use the funds effectively and likelihood that additional funds will improve vacancy situation.
Severely distressed properties should not be a priority, and funding should be targeted for entire developments,
rather than scattered units. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the Department would like to fund all PHAs that meet the requirements of the NOFA, it has decided not to include
the first-come, first-served limitation. The immediate goal of the Department is to promote the occupancy of the
greatest number of units; the problems of severely distressed developments are targeted more directly through other
programs and are not priorities of the vacancy reduction program. Similarly, because of funding limitations, the
Department believes the program purposes will be promoted best by targeting the elimination of vacant units, rather
than the upgrading of entire developments that include occupied units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Under some circumstances, a PHA may be made eligible for program funds, but restricted in spending the funds until
an assessment is performed. If this assessment is not done within 45 days of the fund award, then the PHA should be allowed
to expend the funds. (PHADA, CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has already conducted assessments of known eligible PHAs and will complete all assessments in advance
of funding decisions. In order to ensure fairness, in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Department has provided that a PHA for which an assessment has not been conducted but that considers itself eligible
under the NOFA, should notify the Department within 15 days of its request for an immediate assessment. In addition,
when an approvable plan submitted in response to the NOFA needs improvement or supplementation, the Department will
assist the PHA in revising its plan prior to the execution of the amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).
Because very few, if any, eligible PHAs will not have had assessments by today's publication of the NOFA, the Department
believes that all assessments will be completed on a timely basis in this funding cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Activities that will decrease unit turnover in occupied units (e.g., replacement of appliances) also should
be considered eligible for funding under this program. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the Department recognizes the relationship between turnover and vacancy rates and is sympathetic to this
reasonable suggestion, current funding for the vacancy reduction program is limited. Therefore, the Department
intends to target funding of unit improvements for currently vacant units or units to become vacant for reconfiguration
purposes, where reconfiguration is necessary to reduce the current number of vacancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Funding should be guaranteed for a minimum of a three-year period following HUD approval of a five-year vacancy
reduction plan, subject to the PHA's continued progress on and adherence to its vacancy reduction plan. (CHA, MCHA)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department cannot guarantee funds that have not been appropriated by Congress. Therefore, a PHA's five-year
plan should reflect a realistic projection of the actions that can be taken with available or potential resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If funded activities require compliance with Housing Quality Standards, the amount of funds may not be sufficient
to address problems in areas outside the unit (e.g., hallways, stairways, fire protection systems). HQS standards
should apply only to unit interiors. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department recognizes that current funding available under the Vacancy Reduction Program will not be sufficient
to address all problems areas relating to excess vacancies, and it expects to be guided in its funding decisions by
the assessment team reports. The vacancy reduction plans and the recommendations of the assessment teams should
include all work inside the units, in the hallways, in common areas, on the site, and to the exterior of the buildings
necessary to make the units marketable; providing plans and funding for only the interiors of vacant units may not
make those units marketable. Individual work items funded under this program must comply with modernization standards
and must result in the targeted unit meeting the HQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Program funds should not be directed at PHAs that have vacancy problems due primarily to marketing problems or
lack of demand. (CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that the limited program funds should be focused on those PHAs whose vacancy situations can
actually be improved by additional funding. This factor is accounted for in &sect;968.413(d)(2) of the rule (``extent
to which the proposed activities will improve the PHA's vacancy problem'') and in the definition of ``eligible unit''
set out in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's

Sanctions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Department reported that, at this time, it does not intend to implement section 14(p)(3)
of the statute, which provides sanctions for the failure to make progress under a plan. However, commenters were invited
to submit suggestions on how this portion of the statute could be implemented in the future. Several commenters submitted
remarks on this aspect of the current statutory program, as follows: (1) If a withholding action seems likely after
18 months, an assessment team should be sent to the PHA to perform a review and prepare a report. (PHADA) (2) If there
is withholding, consideration should be given to forcing a receiver to be used so that the funds can be used. (PHADA,
CHA) (3) Withholding of subsidy because of a failure to make progress is contrary to the approach of rewarding PHAs
for solving problems. (MCHA)

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule does not include provisions implementing the sanctions mandated by section 14(p)(3) of the 1937 Act.
However, the Department is continuing to work on those provisions, and will take into consideration the remarks provided
by commenters in response to the proposed rule. The Department will comply with the requirements within the applicable

Use of NOFAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HUD is proposing to use NOFAs as the vehicle to convey significant program information to interested PHAs, which
defeats the intent of notice-and-comment rulemaking. The proposed rule does not provide sufficient detail on how
program funds will be targeted, the format of the vacancy reduction plans, and criteria for determining a PHA's capacity
to implement the plan in a timely and effective manner. Use of NOFAs will lead PHAs to try to second-guess HUD on selection
criteria and lead to a hit or miss approach on solving the vacancy problem. (CLPHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees with this comment. The rule provides the framework for the program and meets or exceeds the
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Department's regulations. The preamble to the proposed
rule elaborates on the Department's expectations for targeting funds made available for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department views the program as a dynamic tool in the effort to reduce unnecessary vacancies in public housing.
Experience with the program and elimination of certain root causes of vacancies will guide the Department in selecting
the optimal criteria for any subsequent targeting of program funds. This targeting would be done in compliance with
the statutory parameters of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to undertake the vacancy reduction effort by providing funding for those vacant units most
likely to be turned around quickly, targeting the majority of the funding for units averaging a cost of $8,000 or less,
with some funds targeted for units for which a CGP agency can provide the additional funding necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the report of the assessment team is expected to address the capacity of a PHA to implement vacancy reduction
activities in a timely and efficient manner. The Department reiterates that the intent of the requirement that participating
PHAs submit vacancy reduction plans is to assist in the development of a comprehensive approach to vacancy reduction.
As demonstrated by its efforts to solicit the input of industry and PHA representatives during the development of
the proposed rule and the initial NOFA, the Department is committed to implementing this program in a constructive
way that responds to the needs of PHAs with remediable vacancy problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before the NOFA is published, there should be a meeting with industry groups. The meeting should be used to share
survey results and exchange viewpoints. (PHADA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department solicited the input of representatives of the industry, PHAs, and resident organizations during
the development of the proposed rule and the initial NOFA. Meetings were held with these representatives on January
28 and July 9, 1993. The Department believes these meetings have been valuable in helping to develop the program, but
does not believe that it is necessary to schedule any additional meetings at this time. The discussions at the previous
meetings, along with the written comments received in response to the proposed rule, have provided the Department
with a foundation for the policy decisions it has made regarding how to operate this program within the parameters
established by Congress. Furthermore, in the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Department discusses the results of the survey, in the context of both general results and specific implications
for the program decisionmaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed rule seems to imply that more than one NOFA might be published in a single fiscal year. Only one NOFA
should be issued and it should coincide with the Comprehensive Grant Program planning process. (PHADA, CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The language that referred to ``periodic'' NOFAs in the proposed rule was intended simply to verify that separate
NOFAs would be published for any money that is appropriated for the program in subsequent years. This is the common
practice of the Department, as established in the HUD Reform Act, but the actual timing of a subsequent NOFA in any fiscal
year cannot be predicted. The Department appreciates the commenters' point about the coordination of capital planning
programs.

Relationship of the Vacancy Reduction Program to Other HUD Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HUD should integrate the approach of the Vacancy Reduction Program into an overall effort to draft a new vacancy
rule. The Vacancy Reduction Program itself is insufficient to address problems faced by PHAs with expired Comprehensive
Occupancy Plans (COPs); these PHAs still need operating funds to keep vacant units in shape until money is available
to make necessary improvements. (CLPHA)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any new vacancy rule would require substantial time for development and implementation. Meanwhile, the Department
is committed to providing assistance currently available under the vacancy reduction program to PHAs with vacancy
problems. Changes to the determination of operating subsidy eligibility as proposed by the commentor are outside
the scope of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Vacancy Reduction Program may duplicate planning requirements of other programs, such as PHMAP and the Comprehensive
Grant Program, that also address vacancy problems. (PHADA, CHA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, the Department appreciates the commenters' point about the coordination of capital planning programs
and will endeavor to integrate the vacancy reduction program with other related programs.

(3) The same format used for the vacancy reduction plan should be used for developing an Improvement Plan under PHMAP
if the PHA fails the PHMAP vacancy standard. (PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to coordinate the formats of these plans, to the extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The restrictions placed on assistance to troubled authorities (see &sect;968.413(b)) should be made consistent
with the language of HOPE VI. (PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The restrictions are prescribed by the authorizing statute for the program. However, in recognition of the comments
requesting coordination of the Department's capital planning programs, the final rule includes new language that
cross-references PHMAP indicators and clarifies the evaluation of the progress of troubled PHAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If a PHA presents a vacancy reduction plan that HUD approves, the PHA should receive operating subsidy based on
its actual occupancy rate, rather than on the current formula rate. (CHA, AHA) How does the Department view this program
in the context of the Performance Funding System (PFS) funding of vacant units? (PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vacancy reduction program is not intended as a substitute for the vacancy rule or to provide relief for PHAs that
do not meet established goals under COPs. However, the vacancy reduction program should improve the revenue situations
of participating PHAs in two ways: First, through direct funding of portions of the plans; second, through the increased
operating subsidies and rent collections that will result from reoccupancy of those vacant units.

Miscellaneous
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The survey results and data developed from analyzing the vacancy reduction plans should be released publicly.
(PHADA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

The Department is releasing data from the survey as part of the NOFA published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, the Department intends to develop a report based on data and information provided by the assessment
teams in their reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Vacancy Reduction Program should be separately funded, instead of using amounts set aside from regular modernization
funding. (PHADA, CHA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As recognized by the commenters, Congress has authority over the mechanism used for funding the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Funding decisions under the program should recognize when a PHA has used existing resources to address its vacancy
problem. For example, although a commitment to use a large portion of CGP funds to address vacancies will reduce the
need for additional vacancy reduction funds, those CGP funds could have been used to fund other substantial needs
of the PHA. (AHA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When PHAs have other modernization needs that cannot be met by current funding, Vacancy Reduction Program funds may
be used instead of CGP funding committed but not yet under contract for vacancy reduction.

Section-by-Section Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is establishing the Vacancy Reduction Program as new subpart D in 24 CFR part 968, with conforming amendments
made as necessary in other sections of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The following discussion is a section-by-section
description of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 968.103 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
addresses the allocation of funds under section 14 of the 1937 Act. The Department is amending paragraph (c) to account
for the new set-aside for the Vacancy Reduction Program. The new language repeats the statutory scheme for setting
aside four percent of the section 14 funds remaining after deducting amounts for emergencies and natural and other
disasters. Paragraph (c)(1) provides that 20 percent of these funds will be available for activities under section
6(j) of the 1937 Act, while the remaining 80 percent will be available for the Vacancy Reduction Program, as implemented
by this rule. Section 968.103 also is amended to clarify that the Vacancy Reduction Program does not apply to Indian
Housing Authorities (IHAs).

Section 968.407 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
establishes the requirement that eligible PHAs submit a five-year vacancy reduction plan, and specifies the contents
of the plan. For purposes of identifying components of a plan that may be identified as eligible for funding, within
the limits of appropriated amounts, each submitted plan must be organized in a manner that facilitates review by the
Department. For each action proposed to eliminate vacancies, the plan must include a schedule that shows the number
of vacancies that the PHA expects to eliminate by the end of each 12-month period during the five years of the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When components of a plan involve capital improvements to dwelling units, the PHA must ensure that, after the improvements,
the units themselves would meet or exceed the Housing Quality Standards set forth in 24 CFR 882.109, as amended by regulatory
requirements concerning lead-based paint hazards.

establishes eligible uses and limitations on the use of funds available for the Vacancy Reduction Program. Paragraphs
(a), (b), and (c) echo the statute establishing the program, but paragraph (b) includes clarifying language that
cross-references PHMAP indicators in measuring the progress required under the statute for troubled PHAs. Paragraph
(d) establishes that funding decisions would be through a publicly announced process, on the basis of priorities

 The Vacancy Reduction Program in subpart D of this part does not apply to IHAs. In addition, because the PHMAP performance
indicators under 24 CFR part 901 do not apply to IHAs, these agencies cannot be deemed ``mod troubled'' for purposes
of the CGP and are not eligible for funding under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Hence, IHAs are not subject to
any reduction in funding under section 14(k)(5)(A) of the Act, and IHAs do not participate in the set-aside credits
established under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule implements section 10(a) of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act of 1975. The Act directs
the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate rules and regulations deemed necessary to guide the use and development
of private lands within the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. This rule establishes the baseline standards
of private land use and development that are compatible with the purposes of the Act and that, if not met, could result
in the Secretary's use of the private land acquisition authority provided by the Act. The intended effect is to ensure
that the values of the HCNRA will be protected and preserved, and as envisioned by the Act, that traditional ranching,
grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and other uses can be perpetuated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (HCNRA) by the Act of December 31, 1975 (the Act) in
order to assure that the natural beauty, and historical and archaeological values of the Hells Canyon area are preserved
for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecologic values and public enjoyment of the area are
thereby enhanced. Public Law 94&hyph;199, 89 Stat. 1117 at Sec. 1 (codified at 16 U.S.C. 460gg et seq.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10 of the Act directs the Secretary to promulgate such rules and regulations as are deemed necessary to accomplish
the purposes of the Act, including standards for the use and development of privately owned property within the HCNRA.
Section 10 further provides that the Secretary may use the land acquisition authority in section 9 of the Act to implement
the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to section 10. As for the Snake, Rapid, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers,
the governing authority for land acquisition is found in section 6 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Both section 9
of the Act and section 6 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act restrict the Secretary's condemnation authority; i.e. acquiring
land without the consent of the landowner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 14, 1993, the Forest Service published a proposed rule that would establish the standards for the use and
development of private lands in the HCNRA (56 FR 65300). The purpose of the proposed regulations was to make clear those
circumstances which would trigger possible use of the Secretary's condemnation authority. The proposed rule established
categories of private land and standards for the use and development of private land within a given category. Compliance
with the standards would generally be deemed consistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Violation
of the standards would generally be deemed inconsistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, and,
thus the lands could become the subject of federal acquisition. Thus, the proposed rule sought to make clear to affected
landowners those uses that could continue or be undertaken without risk of federal acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout its efforts to devise regulations applicable to private lands within the HCNRA, the Forest Service has
sought to avoid direct regulation of private lands and their uses. Instead, the agency has sought to define those uses
of private lands that are consistent with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, to encourage retention
of traditional and valid private land uses as established by the Act, and, thereby, to avoid having to exercise the
condemnation authority granted the Secretary by the Act. Under the proposed rule, the Forest Service would not seek
to regulate per se or enjoin proposed uses or developments on private land. Rather, the agency chose to set forth in
the proposed rule standards for private land use and development, which establish the basis for using the secretary's
land acquisition authority in the HCNRA. The proposed rule also established a mechanism by which a landowner could
petition for a change in land category assignment and a mechanism by which a landowner could determine whether an existing
or proposed land use or development was in compliance with the standards of the rule. The Forest Service may also initiate
a noncompliance determination on its own without having first received a landowner request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the Secretary would not acquire the subject land or interests therein unless it was with the
consent of the landowner in those cases where a landowner was in compliance with the applicable standards. If, however,
the landowner was not in compliance, the Secretary could acquire a fee simple or lesser interest in the subject land
without the landowner's consent. The proposed rule also provided landowners and other interested parties an opportunity
to appeal a compliance or noncompliance determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight letters expressing a variety of viewpoints were received during the 60-day comment period on the proposed rule.
These letters contained the views of a power company, a powerboat association, a preservation group, a local county
government, another agency of the federal government, an ad hoc citizens river committee, a state agricultural organization,
and a local chapter of the same organization. The comments contained in these letters have been carefully considered
in the adoption of this final rule. The Department appreciates the time and energy the reviewers invested in preparing
these letters and articulating their concerns on the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule dealt both with general issues, such as the scope and extent of the Secretary's authority
under this rule, as well as discrete issues relating to specific provisions enumerated in the proposed rule. In addition,
there were several comments urging that language in the Supplementary Information section of the proposed rule be
corrected and/or clarified. A summary of the comments and the Department's response follows.

1. Scope and Extent of the Secretary's Authority Under This Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two reviewers raised a number of concerns regarding the use of the Secretary's land acquisition authority to effectuate
the standards set out in the rule for private land use and development. The comments reflected the divergent views
of the reviewers and, to some degree, a misunderstanding of the system as envisioned in the proposed rule. The comments
received on this issue and the Department's response follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: The Secretary is impermissibly engaged in the zoning of private lands in the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One reviewer suggested that the process set forth in the proposed rule which establishes land use categories and allowable
uses within those categories is ``zoning.'' Further, this same reviewer noted that the acquisition of lands without
the landowner's consent is ``zoning.'' Finally, this reviewer noted that using condemnation to ensure compliance
is an extreme measure and that the Forest Service should attempt to ``work in harmony'' with the private landowners
in the HCNRA to ensure compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule does not vest the Secretary with zoning authority. Zoning is defined as the division of a community
into areas in each of which only certain designated uses of land are permitted, so that a community may develop in an
orderly manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the end result may be the same in terms of protecting an area against potentially incompatible land uses, there
is an important distinction between the exercise of a local government's zoning authority and the federal government's
eminent domain authority. Zoning laws are rooted in the exercise of a state's police power (usually delegated to a
subdivision of the state) to prevent persons under its jurisdiction from using their property to the detriment of
the general welfare. The power of eminent domain, on the other hand, is the power to acquire, or to authorize the acquisition
of, private property for a public use or purpose without the owner's consent, conditioned upon the payment of just
compensation. Because, zoning laws ordinarily do not constitute a taking of property for public use for which compensation
must be paid, they differ substantially from the government's right to determine the use of real estate under the power
of eminent domain, which requires just compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency went to great length to explain that the mechanism by which the Secretary
would protect the HCNRA from incompatible private land use and development was through acquisition (condemnation)
rather than regulation (injunction). In the conclusion to the preamble of the proposed rule [58 FR 65304, Col. 2],
the agency expressly stated that: ``The proposed regulations have been carefully drafted to avoid any conflict with
local zoning authority and any appearance that the Forest Service desires to regulate private land uses.'' Relying
on acquisition authority to enforce zoning ordinances is entirely consistent with sections 9 and 10 of the Act. Moreover,
this approach is the least intrusive to the private landowners in the HCNRA, and it will not duplicate the role nor supplant
the authority of the local governmental units in the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department agrees with the reviewer's observation that condemnation is an extreme measure to enforce
compliance with the standards set out in this rule. As was stated in the conclusion to the preamble to the proposed rule
[59 FR 65304, Col. 2], ``The agency views the use of condemnation authority as a last resort to protect the HCNRA,''
to be instituted only where other, more harmonious measures and attempts to cooperate with the landowners do not succeed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: The Secretary should more actively regulate private lands in the HCNRA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ironically, while one reviewer asserted that the Forest Service had virtually usurped local zoning authority over
the private lands in the HCNRA, another reviewer stated that the Forest Service was obligated to assert a more vigorous
regulatory role over these same lands. In particular, this reviewer asserted that relying on the condemnation authority
delegated to the Secretary in section 9 of the Act will not adequately protect the HCNRA and that the Forest Service
must exercise its ``inherent regulatory authority'' over private lands that are adjacent to federal lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to properly respond to this comment, the following two questions must be addressed_(1) Does the Secretary
have an ``inherent regulatory authority'' vis-a-vis private lands in the HCNRA? and (2) If so, is its exercise necessary
to comply with the HCNRA Act?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not dispute the proposition that, pursuant to the Property Clause of the Constitution, Congress
has delegated to it the authority to regulate and administer National Forest System lands under the Organic Act; the
Multiple-Use, Sustained-Yield Act; the National Forest Management Act; the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources
Planning Act; the Wilderness Act; the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and the HCNRA Act, to name just a few. In furtherance
of those enactments, regulations throughout title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations vest broad authority in the
Forest Service to manage National Forest System lands and many of the activities that occur thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, these authorities are confined to National Forest System lands and do not apply to private lands. The options
regarding regulation on private lands are considerably more limited. To begin with, the Forest Service cannot ``zone''
private lands as that term is commonly understood. ``Zoning'' is an authority that is reserved to the States and their
subdivisions under the Constitution. Congress examined this issue prior to the establishment of the Cape Cod National
Seashore many years ago. Their analysis then is instructive today.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Government does not have authority to directly enact zoning laws applicable to private property in any
of the States. If it had such authority, the task of preserving an area such as lower Cape Cod in such a way as to safeguard
the interests of private landowners might be somewhat simplified, for Congress could simply enact a zoning law for
the area. However, in the division of powers between the States and the Federal Government, it is wisely left to States
to adopt zoning laws *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, [the Act] requires the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations as soon as possible after the
enactment of the bill setting forth the standards which must be met by town zoning bylaws for purposes of suspending
his power of eminent domain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only regulatory authority that the Forest Service possesses relative to private lands is its authority as a landowner
to enjoin activities on adjacent or nearby lands which threaten the National Forest land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the considered judgment of the Department that the acquisition of lands or interests therein, in conjunction
with locally established zoning measures, remains the most efficient and viable system to legally control potentially
incompatible land use and development in the HCNRA. This is the thrust of this rule. Its success depends on the best
efforts of the Forest Service, State and local governments, and landowners in the HCNRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, this rule should not be construed to foreclose the Agency's right to enjoin certain activities which threaten
to compromise the values for which the HCNRA was established. Whether such action is warranted would need to be decided
on a case-by-case basis. In the event that a nuisance-like activity should arise in the future which threatens the
HCNRA, the Forest Service would be fully authorized to exercise its prerogative as a landowner to seek to get the activity
terminated or modified so as to eliminate the deleterious effects on National Forest System lands.

Comment: Snake River water rights. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer suggested that the rule should address withdrawals and diversions of water from the Snake River that
are used for irrigating traditional farming and ranching activities in and around the HCNRA. This reviewer urged
that the rule prescribe: how much water can be diverted, the time and purpose of diversion, and whether the diversion
should be phased out so water may be retained in the Snake River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of water from the Snake River is an integral component of many of the traditional farming and ranching operations
occurring in the HCNRA. While the reviewer's concern may be legitimate and this rule would present an appropriate
vehicle to address these concerns, Section 6 of the Act expressly prohibits the incorporation of these suggestions
into this rule as follows: No provision of this Act, nor any regulations issued hereunder, shall in any way limit, restrict,
or conflict with present and future uses of the waters of the Snake River and its tributaries upstream from the boundaries
of the [HCNRA] created hereby, for beneficial uses, whether consumptive or nonconsumptive, now or hereafter existing,
including, but not limited to, domestic, municipal, stockwater, irrigation, mining, power, or industrial uses.

Comments: Access to private land. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer stated that access is an integral part of the traditional uses recognized under the HCNRA Act and should
not be arbitrarily limited since such limitations would reduce property value and restrict traditional uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the reviewer did not make clear how the proposed rule would limit access to private lands, nor did the reviewer
offer suggestions for addressing the access issue, the Department notes that the proposed rule was silent on the issue
of access and nowhere can it be inferred that the rule would permit the Forest Service to arbitrarily limit such access.
The Department does not believe that this rule needs to address access, since section 1323 of the Alaska National Interest
Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) requires that access be granted to nonfederally owned lands located within the National
Forest System. Agency rules at 36 CFR part 254, subpart E implement section 1323 and already apply to private lands
within the HCNRA which are subject to the terms and conditions for reasonable ingress and egress that may be imposed
by the Forest Service.

Comment: Monitoring. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer noted that the proposed rule failed to establish a system whereby the use and development of private land
in the HCNRA could be monitored by the Forest Service to detect violations. According to this reviewer, the rule is
``grossly deficient, and contrary to law in this respect.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While there was no provision for monitoring in the proposed rule, this rule is not somehow legally insufficient as
a result. Monitoring by the Forest Service can occur in a number of ways and need not be expressly provided for or authorized
in this rule. For instance, monitoring can occur by reviewing the actions of the local government regarding private
land use and development issues. The Forest Service also can and does monitor private land use and development through
routine aerial photographs for fire prevention and control, forest pest management, and landscape planning and
management and on-the-ground observations from adjacent National Forest land. Additionally, where the Forest
Service receives permission from the landowner, monitoring could also be accomplished via an on-site investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, monitoring also would be accomplished through the compliance determination process which
is optional on the part of the landowner. Although the Department believes that monitoring was never eliminated from
the Forest Service's responsibilities by the proposed rule, it also believes that monitoring is so important that
it would like to make clear that the Forest Service may monitor the uses and developments on private lands at any time
it believes it has good reason to be concerned about the protection of the values for which the HCNRA was established.
To emphasize this point, the final rule adds a new standard in &sect;292.24, paragraph (b)(2) which states that the
Forest Service may initiate the compliance process on its own without having first received a landowner request.
This standard clearly shows that the Forest Service may initiate the determination of compliance process, where
the agency has reason to believe, based on monitoring or other information, that the landowner may be violating the
standards for private land use and development established by this rule.

Comment: ``Farm/forest/grazing lands.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two reviewers suggested that the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing lands'' be modified to eliminate references
to watershed protection, fish &amp; wildlife habitat maintenance and recreational activities as purposes for which
farm/forest/grazing lands may be used. These reviewers felt that these additional non-farming uses could pose burdensome
and expensive requirements on the management of farming or grazing operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reviewers' concern that this definition would result in the imposition of additional requirements on their operations
is unfounded. The subject definition is set out in the disjunctive. In other words, farm/forest/grazing lands may
be used for farm/forest/grazing purposes or for watershed purposes, or for fish &amp; wildlife purposes, or for recreational
purposes, or for a combination of the above. The inclusion of these terms in this definition does not imply that new
requirements would be incorporated into ongoing farming and ranching operations in the HCNRA. Of course, these farming
and ranching operations are still subject to applicable federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. Therefore,
the definition is adopted without change from the proposed rule. However, on consideration of the comments on the
term ``farm/forest/grazing lands,'' the Department has determined that the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing
uses'' should be modified so that it more closely parallels the definition of ``farm/forest/grazing lands.'' To
that end, a new second sentence has been included in the ``farm/forest/grazing use'' definition which recognizes
that uses related to watershed protection, fish and wildlife habitat maintenance, and recreational activities
may also be undertaken on these lands. Again, because these activities may be undertaken does not signify that they
must be undertaken. The definition of ``farm/forest/grazing use'' also has been rearranged for ease of reading and
comprehension.

Comment: ``Land modification.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer noted that the definition of ``land modification'' in the proposed rule included road construction
as an example but that the circumstances under which road construction would be accommodated in conjunction with
access needs for the purpose of maintaining and constructing utility facilities were unclear.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that the potential applicability of the definition of ``land modification'' to utility maintenance
activities is unclear. Indeed, while ``land modification'' was included in &sect;292.21 of the proposed rule, it
was not used elsewhere; therefore, it has been deleted from the final rule. Absent this term, the Department construes
the standard at &sect;292.23(a)(4) of the final rule as accommodating reasonable road access to utility facilities
provided that such access is associated with the routine and necessary maintenance of these facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, further review of the definition section disclosed that the terms, ``Comprehensive management plan,''
``seasonal feedlots,'' and ``zoning'', were not used in the proposed rule; accordingly, those terms have not been
retained in the final rule. All other terms and their definitions are retained without change in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule established four categories to which private lands in the HCNRA would be assigned and would require
that maps showing private lands and the categories to which they have been assigned be on file and available for public

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer complained that the map identifying the private lands in the HCNRA and the land use category to which they
had been assigned was not available for review during the comment period on the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department regrets that the map was unavailable, since this could have been of some assistance to the parties in
the preparation of their comments on the rule. The Department has modified this section in the final rule to require
the map (or maps) to be prepared and available for review not later than 60 days after the effective date of this regulation
and also to require the Ranger to give notice of the availability of the maps in the local newspapers of record. If any
parties are concerned about a specific land category assignment, they can make their concerns known to the Forest
Service at that time, and the Forest Service will consider these concerns prior to the adoption of a final map. No other
changes were made to this section.

Section 292.23&blank;Standards of Compatible Land Use and Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would establish standards of private land use and development that reflect traditional and valid
uses of private lands in existence as of December 31, 1975 for four categories of land use. These categories were farm/forest/grazing,
mining, residential, and commercial land. The standards for these land categories were intended to guide the Ranger
in determining whether uses of a private parcel are compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established.
Some standards applied to all categories of private lands, while others were specific only to a particular land category.
Standards were prescribed to allow conformity of private land uses and developments with the laws of various jurisdictions.
Among other things, the proposed rule set standards for the screening and blending of new and replacement structures,
banned solid waste and hazardous substance disposal sites, required utility lines to be buried, disallowed new or
replacement structures in wilderness, and provided for the protection of historic and archaeological sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: Expense of underground utility installation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer noted that the standard in &sect;292.23(a)(4) regarding the placement of new or replacement of existing
utility lines underground could be prohibitively expensive and environmentally damaging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this standard clearly establishes a preference for underground utility installation wherever feasible,
the Department is well aware of the rugged and varied terrain in the HCNRA and the difficulty, if not impossibility,
of installing utility lines underground in certain areas. It is for that reason that the standard in the proposed rule
regarding underground utility installation included the caveat ``where ground conditions and topography permit.''
Therefore, a change in the final rule was necessary. It is recognized that, by necessity, the evaluation of the location
of utility lines must be made on a case-by-case basis.

Comment: Wilderness structures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer opposed the standard in &sect;292.23(a)(5) which provided that no new structures could be developed
on private lands within the boundaries of the Hells Canyon Wilderness in the HCNRA. This reviewer stated that this
standard oversteps the professed bounds of the law. This reviewer further contended that such a restriction should
apply only if the structure would be visible from the wilderness, since otherwise there would be no negative effect
on anyone's wilderness experience. The reviewer also stated that nothing in the Wilderness Act permitted wilderness
visitors to trespass on private lands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of the rule is, where deemed necessary, to apply the same standards for private land uses and developments
to lands within the designated wilderness boundaries, as would be applied outside of wilderness. Under the proposed
rule, those lots within wilderness would be classified as farm/forest/grazing lands. Most of the private land parcels
within wilderness are less than 160 acres, and so, even without the wilderness lands restriction, the proposed rule
would not consider the development of any new residences appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the proposed rule, the Department determined that the protection of the wilderness resource is paramount.
Congress designates wilderness to protect and preserve a variety of natural resource and other values; scenic value
is only one of many attributes. Uses and developments on private lands have the potential to impact a full range of wilderness
values, including scientific, cultural, historical, and water quality values. One of the most important aspects
of the recreational experience within wilderness is the opportunity for solitude and to experience an area where
man is only a temporary visitor. A standard which would allow development of new structures so long as they are not visible
from the wilderness simply ignores the fact that other, non-visual impacts may result from the construction of new
structures. Furthermore, the Forest Service is unaware of any location from which a new structure could be developed
within the wilderness and also not be visible because of the area's topography. As noted in the proposed rule, the repair
and maintenance of existing structures that may be located on private land within a wilderness is not affected by this
standard. Therefore, after considering this comment, no change was made in the final rule regarding the construction
of new or replacement structures in wilderness.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One reviewer objected to the lack of standards in the proposed rule for livestock grazing, timber harvesting, pesticide
use, water quality protection, and ground disturbing activities on private lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This concern is fully addressed by the proposed rule. In determining what approach it should take to the regulation
of private lands, the Forest Service determined that if other federal, state, and local laws and ordinances are enforced,
then the HCNRA Act's purposes would be accomplished. Accordingly, in developing the proposed rule, the agency assessed
existing ordinances and laws for their capability to protect on private lands the values for which the HCNRA was established.
In many instances, the proposed rule expressed these local ordinances as standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the proposed rule made it very clear that other laws would be enforced; if not by the promulgating government,
then, if necessary, by the Forest Service through acquisition (condemnation) action. In &sect;292.23 paragraph
(a)(1), the final rule retains the language of the proposed rule, with minor editing, to make clear that land uses are
compatible if they conform to applicable local, state, and federal laws. This provision is intended to cover such
matters as those referred to by the reviewer. Examples of the types of ordinances and laws that this clause refers to
include the following: Oregon Forest Practices Act; Idaho Forest Practices Act; Idaho Water Quality Standards and
Wastewater Treatment Requirements; Oregon Water Quality Standards; and the Idaho Agricultural Pollution Abatement
Plan. The Department is not aware of any situation which merits standards different from those currently imposed
by other laws. The proposed rule addressed the concerns raised by this reviewer by providing for compliance with environmental
and other laws and ordinances. Therefore, no modification has been made in the final rule as a result of this comment.

Additional Changes Adopted in the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the process of reviewing the comments on &sect;292.23, the Department recognized the need to make two other changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Residences on less than 160 acre parcels in farm/forest/grazing lands. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As drafted, the provision at &sect;292.23(b)(1) that limits residences on farm/forest/grazing lands to minimum
lots of 160 acres could be interpreted to mean that an existing house on a lot that is less than 160 acres would prompt
the Secretary to exercise the acquisition authority. This is not the Department's intent. It is recognized that some
of these smaller parcels have existed with residential developments for years and there is no reason that they should
not continue as a recognized nonconforming use. Consequently, the final rule is modified to make clear that nonconforming
lots (i.e., less than 160 acres) with permanently affixed residences (i.e., constructed on a foundation or basement),
existing on the effective date of the final rule, are in compliance with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sites used for the extraction of common mineral materials. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, at &sect;292.23 (a)(7), would only allowed extraction of common materials for road construction
and maintenance and would limit sites to not exceed 5 acres. The use limitation ignored other forms of construction
that may also use smaller quantities of materials, such as in the repair or construction of structures. It is impractical
to require a landowner to find a gravel source outside of the HCNRA boundaries, when a source may exist already within
a mile of his or her property. Upon reconsideration, the 5 acre size limit appears to be excessive for the foreseen uses
for this resource and the esthetic concerns for the HCNRA. Therefore, the final rule is modified to eliminate the references
to only road construction and maintenance and to decrease the size limit to not exceed 2 acres. As written, the final
rule may be more generally applied to the extraction of common mineral materials for construction and maintenance
purposes so long as these sites have screening and are less than 2 acres in size.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, this section provided an optional compliance determination process so that the landowner
could obtain assurance from the Ranger that existing or proposed uses of their land are compatible with the Act and
thus would not be acquired by the Secretary without their consent. A notice of noncompliance would mean that a proposed
or actual land use does not comply with the standards in &sect;292.23 and thus, could potentially trigger the initiation
of the Secretary's land acquisition authority, as authorized by the Act. This section also proposed a process for
reviewing a compliance or noncompliance decision.

Comment: Noncompliance results in condemnation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Condemnation is one option that may be considered in the event of a noncompliance determination. However, it is not
the only option. The proposed rule clearly states that if the Forest Service makes a noncompliance determination,
it will offer suggestions on how the land use or development could be modified to avoid this result. As noted previously,
condemnation is not the tool of choice to enforce compliance with the standards of this rule_it is the last resort.
In administering the HCNRA, the Forest Service position has been, and will continue to be, one which favors discussion,
negotiation, and cooperation with landowners to reach mutually satisfactory objectives wherever possible.

Three reviewers requested that the procedure to appeal a determination of compliance or noncompliance be modified
to exclude ``other interested parties.'' These reviewers felt that the petition process provided by this rule should
be strictly limited to the Forest Service and the affected landowner and that the involvement of outside parties would
unnecessarily complicate and prolong the process. Another reviewer supported the petition process as set out in

The Department agrees with the reviewers that requests for reviews of compliance and noncompliance determinations
involving ``other interested parties'' could be unnecessarily cumbersome and time consuming and that the review
process should be limited to those directly affected, i.e. the landowner whose property was the subject of the determination.
Accordingly, in the final rule, paragraph (c) of &sect;292.24 has been revised to limit petitions for review to affected
landowners.

in which proposals for use and development of private land in the HCNRA would be channeled through the existing local
mechanisms provided under the Wallowa County Land Use Development Ordinance and the Wallowa County Comprehensive
Land Use Plan. In this alternative, the HCNRA Ranger's role would be limited to that of an interested party who would
be able to testify in favor of or in opposition to a proposed use or development. However, if the Ranger opposed the proposal,
it would be his or her burden to prove that the proposal is contrary to the County Ordinance and Plan. According to this
reviewer, it is only through this mechanism that the standard of local citizen involvement required by state and local
law would be satisfied.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative is not one that the Department can implement and remain consistent with its responsibilities under
the HCNRA Act. The federal interest must be protected and cannot be dependent upon, or subservient to, state and local
zoning decisions. In effect, this alternative would relegate the Forest Service to the status of an interested party
whose comments would be considered by the County in the context of a pending development or use proposal. Forest Service
comments would not be binding on the commission, nor would they necessarily even be persuasive. It is difficult to
comprehend how the Forest Service could carry out its responsibilities under the HCNRA Act and effectively ensure
that activities on the private lands not impair the values for which Congress established the HCNRA under this system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the hope of the Department that the procedures currently in place at the state and local level will suffice to condition,
restrict, or preclude many incompatible uses or developments in the HCNRA. The standards adopted by the final rule
are from local zoning ordinances and applicable laws that already adequately protect the HCNRA. The County's disposition
of pending development proposals should, in most cases, result in decisions that are compatible with the purposes
of the HCNRA Act. However, in the event uses or developments are incompatible, or in the event that the County Ordinances
and Plan are amended in such a way as to lessen the restrictions on private lands which would thereby increase the potential
threat to the HCNRA, then the Forest Service must have the ability to enforce the standards needed to protect the HCNRA.
The rule as proposed provides this protection. Therefore, no change was made to &sect;292.24 in response to this comment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Having carefully considered the comments received on the proposed rule, and explained the basis for adopting or not
adopting changes proposed by reviewers, the Department hereby adopts a final rule to ensure that the use and development
of private lands within the Hells Canyon Recreation Area are compatible with the purposes for which Congress established
the Area and its management direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards established by the final rule are those essential to protection of the Area. The approach adopted is
not one of direct federal regulation of private land but rather one of relying, to the greatest extent possible, on
local zoning authority. The rule gives private landowners notice of those uses that are compatible with the purposes
of the HCNRA, provides a mechanism whereby the landowner and the agency may determine compliance or noncompliance
with the standards of the rule and gives constructive notice to private landowners that incompatible uses of private
land may trigger the use of the Secretary's condemnation authority. Nevertheless this rule is predicated on the premise
that the use of the Secretary's condemnation authority is to be a last resort and that the agency shall make every effort
to work harmoniously and cooperatively with private landowners to ensure protection of the HCNRA.

Regulatory Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
nor state or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise
new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, this final rule
is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this final rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and
it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as defined by that Act. To the extent that the rule imposes additional requirements on any small entity, these
requirements are the minimum necessary to protect the public interest, are not administratively burdensome or costly
to meet, and are well within the capability of small entities to perform.

Takings Implication
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since this rule is premised on the formal exercise of the Secretary's eminent domain authority, it is not an ``action''
as that term is defined in Section 2(c)(1) of Executive Order 12630. Nonetheless, the Office of General Counsel has
reviewed this rule for takings implications and determined that there is no risk of a taking related to this rule or
its implementation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Accordingly, (1) all state and local
laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule or which impede its full implementation are preempted; (2)
no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) it will not require administrative proceedings before parties
could file suit in court challenging its provisions.

This rulemaking was discussed as a proposed rule in the final Environmental Impact Statement and Comprehensive Management
Plan for the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, pages 155&hyph;158. The analysis completed for the Comprehensive
Management Plan was revalidated in April 1990 with the signing of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Land and Resource
Management (pages 1&hyph;2). Information pertaining to the environmental analysis may be obtained by writing or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As outlined in the rule at &sect;292.24, a landowner may request an optional compliance determination from the Forest
Service. As such, this rule contains information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements
are assigned control number 0596&hyph;0135 and are approved for use through March 1997.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 U.S.C. 460gg&hyph;460gg&hyph;13)
encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing,
farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, as they existed at the time
the HCNRA was established on December 31, 1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate
regulations establishing standards for the use and development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary
limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards are not met. The purpose of this subpart
is to establish standards that would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited condemnation authority
granted by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in this subpart establish standards applicable to all private property within the boundaries of
the HCNRA, including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells
Canyon Wilderness. The regulations in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of private property;
rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was established.
Uses not compatible with these standards could result in the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without
a landowner's consent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect a taking of private property, including valid,
existing water rights, nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a private landowner's property
use that is compatible with the purposes of the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this subpart
solely to determine whether private land uses or developments are compatible with the purposes and direction of the
Act and, if not, to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating condemnation proceedings to acquire
land or scenic easements.
