SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is amending its practices and procedures by extending the regulatory time limits for filing initial appeals,
class action appeals, motions for attorney fees, initial appeals raising issues of prohibited discrimination,
and requests to review final decision under negotiated grievance procedures. The time limit for filing appeals with
the Federal courts, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is currently greater than that of the
Board. This change brings the Board's practices and procedures more in line with those entities and will also have
the effect of making the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This change in the Board's practices and procedures came about as a result of Executive Order 12866 of September 30,
1993, requiring agencies to ensure that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable.
The Board's review found that changing the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent
with the legal and regulatory time limits for filing with the Federal Courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission both of which can potentially review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed
change will help to eliminate possible confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board announced this change as a proposed rule at 59 FR 18764, April 20, 1994, and asked for comments. The Board received
29 comments from agency and union representatives. Twenty-two were in favor of or not opposed to the proposed amendments.
There was significantly more support for the proposed amendments than opposition. While some commenters suggested
alternatives to the proposed regulations, the Board has considered these suggestions and determined not to adopt
them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order
12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612).

The Board is amending its Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based
on Whistleblowing. This amendment extends the time limit for filing an appeal of an agency action where the appellant
first files a request for a stay of that action. This change will bring the filing time in initial whistleblower cases
into line with filing times in the Board's appellate jurisdiction cases and will also have the effect of making the
Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends part 658 of title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations which implements the Farmland Protection Policy
Act (FPPA). The amendments contained in this rule are necessary to enable the Department of Agriculture to effectively
implement the FPPA, as amended. They request reports by federal agencies, recognize the statutory authority of a

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture (the Department) implementing the Farmland Protection
Policy Act (FPPA) are contained in 7 CFR part 658. A proposed rule, setting forth several amendments to these regulations,
was published for public comment on January 14, 1987, at 52 FR 1465. The comment period closed February 27, 1987, during
which time nineteen sets of comments were received from five federal agencies; four state agencies; seven national
organizations in the agricultural, resource conservation, and planning fields; one county board of supervisors;
and two individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, as discussed below, contained six amendments to the Department's existing regulations. Of these
six amendments, three were being proposed as a result of the specific changes in the FPPA that Congress had enacted
in section 1255 of the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, 99 Stat. 1518. Another amendment to the existing
rule was to correct a clerical mistake. These four amendments, with minor changes, are made final by this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two remaining amendments, of the six included in the proposed rule, were not responses to any new direction enacted
by Congress, but were the Department's proposals to change its policy in the interpretation of FPPA provisions. These
two amendments were a departure from the policy that the Department had announced when the existing regulations were
promulgated on July 5, 1984, 49 FR 27716. The existing sections of part 658 that would be changed by these two amendments
are &sect;&sect;658.2(a) and 658.3(c). The rationale underlying the provisions of the existing regulations is
set forth in the preamble of the final rule publication, which is found at 49 FR 27716&hyph;27724. The rationale for
the proposed changes is set forth in the preamble of the proposed rule at 52 FR 1465&hyph;1468. After reviewing the
policy considerations that led to the adoption of the existing regulations in 1984, as well as considering the proposed
changes and the public comments to the proposed rule, the Department has concluded that the proposed amendments to
&sect;658.2(a) should be adopted with some additional interpretive clarification, as discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department has concluded that &sect;658.3(c) should be amended as proposed to comport with the authority
of a governor of a state to take action to enforce the provisions of the FPPA with regard to a policy or program of the affected
state for the protection of farmland.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FPPA was enacted as Subtitle I, sections 1539&hyph;1549, of Title XV of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, Public
Law 98&hyph;98, 7 U.S.C. 4201&hyph;4209. In enacting the FPPA, Congress found that the Nation's farmland was ``a
unique natural resource'' and that each year, ``a large among of the Nation's farmland'' was being ``irrevocably
converted from actual or potential agricultural use to nonagricultural use,'' in many cases as a result of action
taken or assisted by the federal government. The FPPA directs federal agencies to identify and take into account the
adverse effects of federal programs on the preservation of farmland; consider alternative actions, as appropriate,
that could lessen such adverse effects; and assure that such federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible
with state government, local government, and private programs and policies to protect farmland.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to guide the federal agencies in implementing the FPPA, section 1541(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202(a), directs
the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with other departments, agencies, independent commissions, and
other units of the federal government, to ``develop criteria for identifying the effects of Federal programs on the
conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses.'' The Department issued these criteria in its current rule implementing
the FPPA at 7 CFR 658.4 and 658.5. The FPPA also authorizes the Department to provide technical assistance to federal,
state, and local government agencies to develop programs or policies to limit the conversion of productive farmland
to nonagricultural uses, and this is covered in the current rule at 7 CFR 658.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203, requires ``each department, agency, independent commission,
or other unit of the Federal Government'' to review its laws, administrative rules, policies and procedures ``to
determine whether any provision thereof will prevent'' the federal entity ``from taking appropriate action to comply
fully'' with the FPPA, and to ``develop proposals for action to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative
activities into conformity with the purpose and policy'' of the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act does not expressly require a federal agency to modify any project solely to avoid or minimize the effects of
conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. The Act merely requires that, before taking or approving any action
that would result in conversion of farmland as defined by the FPPA, the federal agency examine the effects of that action
using the criteria which the Department of Agriculture has supplied and, if there are adverse effects, to consider
alternatives to lessen those effects. Once the agency has completed this examination, it may proceed with a project
that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As originally enacted, the FPPA contained a prohibition against the use of the Act as a basis for litigation. Section
1548 states that the FPPA ``shall not be deemed to provide a basis'' for any litigation '`challenging a Federal project,
program or other activity that may affect farmland.'' 7 U.S.C. 4209. In the 1985 amendments to the FPPA, Congress amended
this section to allow the governor of a state to bring a suit to enforce compliance with section 1542 (7 U.S.C. 4202)
and related regulations.

II. Discussion of the Existing Regulations to Implement the FPPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations were promulgated principally to enable federal agencies, with the help of the Soil Conservation
Service (SCS), to measure the adverse effects, if any, of their programs and projects on farmland. The SCS has developed
a Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, Form AD&hyph;1006, for this purpose. A federal agency considering a project
on or affecting farmland completes and submits a Form AD&hyph;1006 to a local SCS office. The SCS determines if the
proposed site or sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, i.e., farmland that is ``prime,'' ``unique,'' or of ``statewide
or local importance,'' as defined by the FPPA. If SCS determines that the site or sites are not subject to the Act, SCS
returns the form to the agency with that determination noted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if SCS determines that the FPPA applies, SCS measures the ``relative value'' of the site or sites as farmland
on a scale of 0 to 100, enters this score on the Form AD&hyph;1006 and returns the form to the federal agency. At this stage,
the agency prepares a site assessment using twelve criteria set forth in the rule. After scoring each of the criteria
and arriving at a total site assessment score, up to a maximum of 160 points, the agency adds this site assessment score
to the ``relative value'' score that was supplied by the SCS on the Form AD&hyph;1006. The higher the combined score,
the more suitable the site would be for protection as farmland. On the other hand, if a site receives a combined score
of less than 160 points, the regulation recommends that it be given only ``a minimal level of consideration for protection''
and that additional sites do not need to be evaluated as alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the primary purpose of the Department's regulations implementing the FPPA was to impart these criteria
and the guidelines for their use by agencies, the rule, in addition, established the Department's policy as to the
farmlands that are subject to the FPPA, and as to the effect that the FPPA could have on private parties and nonFederal
units of government applying for federal assistance to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the first matter, the FPPA's definition of ``prime farmland,'' excludes ``land already in or committed
to urban development or water storage.'' Section 1540(c)(1)(A), 7 U.S.C. 4201(c)(1)(A). The current regulation,
&sect;658.2(a), provides that prime farmland is ``committed to urban development or water storage'' if a local zoning
code or ordinance or current local comprehensive land use plan designated this land for commercial or industrial
use or for residential use that is not intended at the same time to protect farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the second issue, the current regulation, &sect;658.3(c), sets forth the Department's determination
that the FPPA does not authorize a federal agency to withhold assistance to a project solely because that project was
going to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1546 of the FPPA, as enacted in 1981 (99 Stat. 1343&hyph;1344), required the Secretary of Agriculture to report
to Congress on the progress made in implementing the FPPA. Only one report was required; and it was due within one year
after the date of enactment, December 22, 1981. Section 1546 provided that the report should include information
on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The effects, if any, of federal programs, authorities, and administrative activities with respect to the protection
of United States farmland; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The results of the reviews of existing policies and procedures required under section 1542(a) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As amended by section 1255 of the Food Security Act of 1985, section 1546 (7 U.S.C. 4207) now requires an annual report
due at the beginning of each calendar year. The existing regulation, which was published prior to the amendment of
section 1546, does not include any provisions for an annual report to Congress. Further, under the existing regulation,
once agencies have completed their site assessments on the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form (Form AD&hyph;1006),
they retain these forms and proceed to make their own decisions regarding the use of the site for the project in question.
They do not make a regular practice of returning the form or a copy of it to SCS. Thus, SCS receives no record of the agency's
use of the form or the agency's ultimate decision on the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the existing regulation does not require a federal agency to report regularly to the Department on the
progress made with the review of current provisions of law, administrative rules and regulations, and policies and
procedures applicable to the federal agency to determine whether any provision thereof will prevent such unit of
the federal government from taking appropriate action to comply fully with the provisions of the FPPA. This review
is required by section 1502(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now that the Act requires an annual report that includes both the effects of federal activities on the protection of
farmland and the reviews undertaken by agencies, it is necessary for the Department to modify its existing regulations.
Accordingly, the proposed rule in 1987 included two amendments to the existing regulations to enable the Department
to carry out its reporting obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these amendments would have added a new &sect;658.4(g) to request federal agencies to return a copy of
their completed Form AD&hyph;1006 to SCS after a final decision on a project has been made. This amendment received
support in comments from all nongovernmental organizations and individuals, from the State of Rhode Island Statewide
Planning Program, and from the Clarke County (Virginia) Board of Supervisors. However, the response was different
from federal and state agencies that work with Form AD&hyph;1006 and would be responsible for returning it to the SCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two federal agencies, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), and the Michigan Department of Transportation and that of Oklahoma expressed concern that this requirement
would generate additional, burdensome paperwork. The FHWA suggested that only those forms in which the selected
site had a score of more than 160 be returned to SCS. HUD proposed to advise SCS of any tracts of farmland for which financing
of housing subdivisions was being approved, but said it would be hard-pressed to return a Form AD&hyph;1006 for each
action taken by HUD, especially those involving individual mortgage insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Michigan Department of Transportation and that of Oklahoma made comments that were almost identical to one another.
On federally supported highway projects requiring environmental assessments or impact statements, the Form AD&hyph;1006
is included in such documentation and SCS receives a copy of the final document. Lesser projects, on the other hand,
do not require an environmental assessment or impact statement, because they are often categorically excluded from
review by regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These projects ``usually require only
minor amounts of right-of-way and thus have a very minimal impact on prime farmland,'' the Oklahoma Department of
Transportation stated. Both Michigan and Oklahoma objected to having to submit Form AD&hyph;1006 on these types
of projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that this change in its regulation may increase the paperwork requirement on federal public
works and other federally, assisted programs that are already burdened with reporting requirements. Congress,
however, directed that each year the Department is to report on the effects federal programs and actions are having
on farmland, and the Department believes that collecting the Form AD&hyph;1006 data generated by the affected federal
agencies is the best way to compile this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has made changes in the final rule to reduce reporting burdens. Under the current rule, SCS determines
whether the site or sites in question are of the type of farmland subject to the FPPA. Even in cases where SCS determines
the FPPA does not apply and SCS returns a Form AD&hyph;1006 to the referring agency, further tracking of agency decisionmaking
is carried out with a report back to SCS on the final decision regarding the initial referral. New procedures set forth
in &sect;658.4(g), give agencies the option of referring questions of FPPA applicability to SCS or of making these
determinations themselves, and in cases where SCS makes a negative determination, there is no further tracking of
matters in which none of the alternatives involve farmland subject to the FPPA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second amendment to the existing regulations related to the annual reporting function is a new &sect;658.7(d).
This new paragraph (d) will require each federal agency to report to the Chief of SCS the agency's progress during the
prior fiscal year in reviewing its authorities, internal rules, policies and procedures, and the agency's development
of proposals to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the FPPA, pursuant
to section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This second amendment drew a pattern of comments similar to those offered for amendment one. The organizations and
individuals who generally supported the amendments in the proposed rule were in support of this subsection. However,
three of the federal agencies that would be required to make these yearly reports to SCS were critical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposed that once an agency has demonstrated that its programs, authorities,
and administrative activities are in compliance with the FPPA, it should not be required to make an annual report.
Rather, The FmHA asserted, such an agency should be requested to report only in a year in which it either plans to change
its FPPA compliance process or undertakes a new program that may be subject to the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA commented that a single report from an agency should be sufficient until any future revisions to the FPPA or
the SCS regulations are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) asked for additional guidance concerning the type of information in the report,
and recommended that the annual report be an assessment of the progress made in implementing the FPPA, without excessive
and burdensome documentation of specific farmland conversion or protection activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has incorporated the suggestion offered by the FmHA in the final rule. Although the request for an annual
report will remain, once the agency has completed the review of its policies and procedures and revised them as needed
to comply with the Act, no additional reports are requested. In years in which the agency has changed its FPPA compliance
process, a report is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the concern expressed by the TVA, the scope of the agencies' reports to SCS under the new &sect;658.7(d) is that
which is established in section 1542 of the FPPA and which is set forth in the unchanged sections of the existing regulations,
7 CFR 658.7(a) and (b). In other words, the annual reports the agencies are to submit to SCS are to be limited to the reviews
of laws, regulations, policies, and procedures that the agencies have conducted under section 1542(a) of the FPPA
and the proposals for action, if any, that the agency has developed pursuant to section 1542(b). In addition, SCS will
be receiving data from the agencies on their individual project decisions involving farmland, but this data will
come from the various AD&hyph;1006 forms that the agencies are to return to SCS after making their action decisions.

Section 1255(b) of the Food Security Act of 1985, 99 Stat. 1518, amended section 1548 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4209, which
originally prohibited states, local governments, and private parties using the FPPA as a basis to bring actions challenging
Federal activities. Prior to the amendment, the language of section 1548 was as follows:

Accordingly, &sect;658.3(d) of the existing regulation, which is simply a restatement of section 1548 in its original
form, needs to be amended to conform with section 1548, as amended. None of the commenting parties expressed opposition
to the proposal for this change in the regulation, and it is incorporated in this rule.

When 7 CFR part 658 was published as a final rule in 1984, it was intended to include &sect;658.7(b), which simply incorporates
the provision of section 1542(b) of the Act requiring the federal agencies to develop proposals for action to bring
their programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the FPPA. However, in the draft
of the rule submitted to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, paragraph (b) was inadvertently omitted, leaving a gap between &sect;658.7(a) and &sect;658.7(c) as they appeared
in the published rule at 49 FR 27727. The proposed rule of January 14, 1987 included an amendment to restore this missing
paragraph. None of the commenting parties expressed opposition to this correction, and it is incorporated in the
final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Amendment to Change Definition of ``Prime Farmland Committed to Urban Development of Water Storage''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FPPA does not include all farmland under its protection. In section 1540(c), 7 U.S.C. 4201(c), the specific farmland
covered by the FPPA is defined. This is farmland that is either ``prime farmland,'' ``unique farmland,'' or ``farmland,
other than prime or unique farmland, that is of statewide or local importance.'' Each one of these terms is further
defined and qualified in the FPPA and, in the definition of ``prime farmland, there is an exclusion of ``land already
in or committed to urban development or water storage.'' Federal agencies are not required to consider the impact
of their projects on prime farmland that is ``already in or committed to urban development or water storage,'' even
if this land would otherwise fall within the definition of ``prime farmland.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the existing regulations, the Department adopted standards for determining if prime farmland is ``already
in urban development'' and whether land, although not ``in urban development,'' was nevertheless ``committed to
urban development.'' Under &sect;658.2(a) of the current regulation, prime farmland which had been zoned for nonagricultural
use by a state or local government with jurisdiction over the land, or which was designated in a current state or local
land use plan for nonagricultural use, is regarded as ``committed to urban development.'' This would mean that projects
on prime farmland in those areas would not have to be analyzed by agencies for their effect on prime farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department noted in the preamble to the 1984 final rule, at 49 FR 27720, that land use planning and zoning ``are prerogatives
of state and local government, not the Federal Government,'' and supplied the following rationale for the conclusion
that prime farmland under nonagricultural zoning or planning was excluded from the FPPA:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
If a federal agency were required by the Act to assess the impacts of a project on prime farmland not yet in urban development
but already designated by the state or local government for urban development through planning or zoning, the only
purpose of the requirement would be for that agency to weigh alternative sites that would lessen the impact of the project
on farmland. If the agency, based on its assessment pursuant to the Act, should then decide to refrain from building
its project on the proposed site, it would be declining itself to use the proposed site for urban development when local
or state planning or zoning had already declared urban uses to be acceptable on the site. This would be an intrusion
by the Federal Government in the function of land use planning of state and local governments.

In the proposed rule, the Department offered for public comment a proposal that would abrogate the Department's previous
interpretation of this question. In the definition of ``prime farmland,'' there would no longer be an exclusion based
solely on the designation of the land in a land use plan or zoning code or ordinance for nonagricultural uses. The proposed
rule amendment would provide that once a project site had been analyzed and given a combined score of 160 points or less,
it would be considered ``committed to urban development'' and thus no longer covered by the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the 1987 proposed rule, at 52 FR 1466&hyph;1467, cited three reasons for introducing these changes.
First, it stated that the existing definition ``is inconsistent with the definitions of prime farmland used in almost
all other State and Federal programs which use the definition.'' Second, it noted that the existing definition requires
the SCS district conservationists to review local plans and land use regulations and that many of them do not have the
background in land use planning to make the proper determinations as to whether a given project site is truly ``committed
to urban development.'' Third, because land ``committed to urban development'' is excluded in the FPPA's definition
of ``prime farmland'' but not from the FPPA's definitions of farmland that is ``unique'' or ``of statewide or local
importance,'' it is an anomaly that this type of ``prime farmland'' can be so easily and categorically put outside
the reach of the FPPA while farmland that is ``unique'' or ``of statewide or local importance'' is covered by the FPPA
despite the existence of zoning designations or land use plans that would allow urban development of such lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments on the proposed rule were sharply divided on whether the Department should change the identification
of farmland ``committed to urban development.'' The American Farmland Trust ``strongly'' supported the proposed
change, calling the existing rule ``confusing and inconsistent with the intent of the legislation.'' The Natural
Resources Defense Council (NRDC) also supported the proposed change since it did not approve of farmland being excluded
from the FPPA's coverage just because local land-use plans or zoning ordinances would allow urban development on
it. This, the NRDC stated, would be an ``arbitrary `grandfather' exclusion *&blank;*&blank;* even where there is
no current nonagricultural development and the prospect of future nonagricultural development is highly speculative.''
The American Land Resource Association agreed with the proposed change, claiming that the existing rule worked ``inadequately''
for protection of prime farmland and caused ``unnecessary confusion among Federal agencies implementing the FPPA.''
The Farmers Home Administration and the Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program supported the change. Other commenting
parties agreed with the change as part of their general support of all the amendments being proposed.

However, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and
the Michigan Department of Transportation opposed making the change in the Department's interpretation of farmland
``committed to urban development.'' In particular, HUD devoted the principal thrust of its comments to this provision,
objecting ``strongly'' to the change and outlining the importance of retaining the Department's current interpretation
that land under planning or zoning for nonagricultural use was ``committed to urban development.'' HUD stated:

This procedure ignores and undermines a local government's land use decisions made through zoning, comprehensive
planning, and subdivision regulations which are adopted to guide and direct urban development and growth *&blank;*&blank;*
By changing the definition of `farmland committed to urban development' and requiring a Farmland Conversion Impact
Rating (AD&hyph;1006) be prepared, which must result in an aggregated score of 160 points or less before it is considered
`farmland committed to urban development,' certainly qualified USDA as taking a ``big brother'' approach to local
land use plans and decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD explained that whenever an application for project assistance is submitted to HUD, it must receive approval of
local authorities. Since 1985, HUD's principal method for issuing mortgage insurance on single, family homes in
housing subdivisions has been to wait until the local government has approved the subdivision plan and construction
of the necessary streets and water and sewer systems. Under the existing rule, HUD would not have to analyze this land
as ``prime farmland'' under FPPA. HUD argued that under the proposed rule, it would be required to complete the AD&hyph;1006
form on this land, which it termed a ``useless exercise'' at that point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aside from the mechanics of the proposed amendment, HUD made these comments about the general problem of farmland
protection measures that the agency might undertake:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
In the single family housing program (which actions are most likely to be on the fringes of urban areas), preservation
of farmland would require that we would have to either be involved in the local planning and zoning process at the earliest
conceptual stages or by prohibitive and restrictive regulations which would withhold assistance for projects which
had converted farmland to nonagricultural uses. Taking either action could easily be interpreted as an indirect
way to regulate the use of private land or affect the property rights of the owners of such lands. We do not believe that
to be the intent of Congress. Putting a penalty on the land, either directly or indirectly, could result in creating
a greater housing shortage, especially for low and moderate income families who are the primary users of HUD mortgage
housing programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, likewise, objected to the proposal on the grounds that it would require preparation of a site assessment
on every project that requires rights-of-way. This would require ``an enormous amount of time and resources to be
provided by Federal, State and/or local agencies'' and in many cases there would be ``no apparent justification.''
FHWA suggested that the same exclusion of farmland ``committed to urban development'' that the Department has applied
to ``prime farmland'' should be applied to the other two categories in the FPPA, ``unique'' farmland and farmland
``of local or statewide importance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Michigan Department of Transportation had similar objections. It explained that the current rule ``screens
out many projects and constitutes a real time savings *&blank;*&blank;* If the local entities have designated the
land for other uses, it doesn't warrant a high degree of protection as resource base at the federal level.'' On the other
hand, if the rule were changed, it would require site assessments of ``each project that required rights-of-way.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule at 52 FR 1467, the zoning and land use plans that are applicable to a particular
site will be considered in conjunction with other criteria that are designed to assess the degree to which the site
is committed to urban development. In this way, the prerogatives of state and local government, as exercised in zoning
codes and land use plans, will play a role in determining whether a site should be given further FPPA review. Because
the amended regulations will neither prohibit the providing of federal assistance to convert farmland nor preclude
the conversion of farmland through non-federal means, the Department believes that the amended rule, as proposed,
will not interfere with local land use planning, and will assure that prime farmlands will, to the full extent of the
law, be given appropriate consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, sites that contain prime farmland that otherwise would have been exempted due to being
``in or committed to urban development'' would have still been covered by the FPPA if the site also contained lands
of statewide or local importance. The exclusion of lands ``in or committed to urban development'' would have limited
effect. After consideration of the comments, the Department is amending the rule to apply the exemption for farmland
``in or committed to urban development'' to all four types of farmland. It is clear from the comments provided by a number
of federal agencies that they are already applying the exemption to all four types of farmland. Section 658.2(a) is
being revised to remove the word ``prime'' before the word ``farmland,'' thereby, making the exemption apply to all
farmland.

An AD&hyph;1006 for a site that is located in urban areas need not be sent to SCS for evaluation. In addition, some agencies
would like to use available mapped information to make their determinations without sending a Form AD&hyph;1006
to SCS. To facilitate the use of such information, &sect;658.2(a) will be revised to clarify that farmland ``already
in'' urban development or water storage may be identified by an area shown as ``urbanized area'' (UA) on the Census
Bureau map, or shown as an urban tint outline or urban area map on U.S.G.S. topographical maps, or shown as urban-built-up
on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not farmland and,
therefore, are not subject to the Act. In addition, &sect;658.4(a) is being amended to clarify that federal agencies
may determine whether or not a site contains farmland as defined in &sect;658.2(a) without sending a Form AD&hyph;1006
to SCS. Where SCS is asked to complete the land evaluation portion of Form AD&hyph;1006 before the Federal agency completes
the site assessment portion, and SCS determines that the site is subject to the FPPA, then when SCS returns the form
to the agency for completion of the site assessment portion, SCS will at the same time provide the agency with the requested
information and data necessary for the Federal agency to complete and score the site assessment factor questions,
and where the agency chooses to complete the site assessment portion of the form first, SCS will cooperate in providing
timely information and data to enable the Federal agency to score the site assessment factor questions.

E. Amendment to Allow an Agency to Either Provide or Deny Assistance to a Project to Convert Farmland
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing regulations, at &sect;658.3(c), interpret the extent to which an agency can use the FPPA as a basis for
denying assistance to a project that would convert farmland. The paragraph reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or nonfederal
land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. The Act and these regulations do not provide authority
for the withholding of federal assistance to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses. In case where either a private
party or a nonfederal unit of government applies for federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural
use, the federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse
effects on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that could avoid or mitigate such
adverse effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the applicant wants
to proceed with the conversion, the federal agency may not, on the basis of the Act or these regulations, refuse to provide
the requested assistance.

The proposed rule contained an amendment that would change the Department's interpretation of the effect of the FPPA
by revising this paragraph significantly. This amendment would drop the second sentence. In the closing sentence,
instead of retaining the language that the federal agency ``may not, on the basis of the Act or these regulations, refuse
to provide the requested assistance,'' the new language would state that the agency, after doing the required analysis
and following its internal policies or procedures, would be free to deny as well as provide the assistance. See 52 FR
1467.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for this proposed change, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 52 FR 1466, is that the FPPA
leaves to the discretion of each agency ``the determination of whether the providing or the denial of Federal assistance
for farmland conversion will, in a given situation, comply with the policy and purpose of the FPPA.'' It was further
noted that the rule, as presently written, ``may be misread as a limitation on the previously described discretion
provided by Congress to Federal agencies,'' and thus the amendment was needed ``to recognize that discretion and
the general process through which it is exercised.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, when private landowners as well as state and local governments apply for assistance
for a project involving the conversion of farmland subject to the FPPA, the federal agency is required to examine the
effects of the project and alternatives but may not, based on the FPPA, refuse to provide the assistance. The amendment
in the proposed rule would avoid making this analysis a pointless exercise by removing the rigid restriction on agency
deliberations and allowing the agency to use the FPPA analysis as a basis for withholding assistance to the project
in order to achieve the policies and objectives of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of the parties who commented raised opposition to this proposal to change the existing regulation. A number of
them supported it vigorously or proposed that it be made even stronger. The FmHA suggested the rule should provide
that ``if a clear alternative exists to avoiding a proposed conversion of important farmland and the applicant for
Federal assistance is unwilling to pursue such an alternative, the Federal agency cannot provide financial assistance.''
FmHA went on to argue that if the FPPA did not impose this ``affirmative duty'' on agencies to deny assistance, ``then
other significant provisions of the Act become meaningless, such as (1) the ability of a governor to bring action in
Federal district court to enforce the requirements of the FPPA, and (2) the requirement that each Federal agency identify
and report to Congress any provisions of law, administrative rules, regulations, policies, and procedures applicable
to it which prevent it from complying fully with the FPPA. What can governors enforce, what possible legislative or
regulatory conflicts can exist, if the FPPA allows a Federal agency total discretion in deciding whether or not to
finance an unnecessary conversion of important farmland?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council, the American Land Resource Association, and the American Farmland Trust
also supported the change and, like the FmHA, proposed that it contain requirements that federal assistance be withheld
from nonagricultural development in cases where alternatives mitigating or avoiding prime farmland conversion
are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, after considering the comments, believes that the proposed rule amendment is necessary to achieve
the intent of Congress under the FPPA and, therefore, adopts that amendment in this rule. The amended &sect;658.3(c)
allows the various federal agencies to consider the particular facts relating to their proposed assistance activities
and to decide, in light of the policies of the FPPA and their own authorities, which reasonable alternative action
will best achieve their mission and comply with the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In similar deference to the agency discretion provided by the FPPA, the Department has determined not to accept the
recommendations for a complete withholding of federal assistance to convert farmland in situations where alternatives
exists to avoid or mitigate the effects of conversion. There may be, specific situations, compelling reasons of national,
state, or local importance that would outweigh the protective policies of the Act. The federal agencies, in exercising
the responsibility provided by the FPPA, can best analyze the facts of those situations, and their discretion to do
so should not be unnecessarily constrained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the Congress, during deliberations on proposed amendments to the FPPA as part of the Food
Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, considered and rejected a ban on federal assistance to convert farmland
in situations where reasonable alternatives to conversion exist. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 447, 99th Cong., 1st Sess.
472 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2398. The final rule allows the intentions of Congress,
as expressed in the FPPA and in the 1985 deliberations, to be carried out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During consideration of the comments received on the proposed rule and in interagency discussions within the Department,
a misunderstanding of the scope of the analysis required by the FPPA and the regulations surfaced. This related to
the extent to which federal agencies are required to identify and assess the potential for future conversion of farmland
as a result of present activities and assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with other natural resource or environmental evaluations, such as the analyses required by the National Environmental
Policy Act, the scope of the review must be related to the scope of the activity under consideration. In complying with
the requirements of section 1542 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 4203) that each federal agency review its programs, authorities,
policies, and procedures and take appropriate measures to assure that they conform with the purposes of the FPPA,
an agency may properly consider the broader implications that its programs and policies have toward the potential
for future conversions of farmland to nonagricultural uses. However, in considering whether a specific project
or assistance activity of the agency will result in the irreversible conversion of farmland, the focus will be on those
direct and indirect effects of the activity that can be reasonably identified and evaluated. In a review of a specific
activity which does not contain proposals for, nor necessarily lead to, future activities that may convert farmland,
the potential activities may be too general or speculative to adequately identify and usefully consider. The scope
of each evaluation is determined by the scope of the objectives and facts of the agency activity under consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that the guidance provided in &sect;658.3(c), as amended by this rule, regarding the providing
of federal assistance to convert farmland clearly applies beyond situations where a federal agency has been requested
to provide assistance. Federal activities that are the result of federal initiatives, rather than requests for federal
assistance, necessarily involve the same farmland protection policy considerations. In a situation where a Federal
agency is contemplating an action that would convert farmland to a nonagricultural use and which is not the result
of a direct request for federal assistance, the federal agency may decide, after conducting the analysis required
by the FPPA, not to proceed with the action in order to achieve the objectives of the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the policy objectives of the FPPA in the manner discussed above and as contained in this final rule
not only respects the traditional deference to state and local land use decisionmaking reflected in the FPPA, but
also comports with and furthers the principles of federalism contained in Executive Order No. 12612 of October 26,
1987, 52 FR 41685. Local zoning and land use plans will be considered in determining if a site has been committed to urban
development. Further, a federal agency may support state and local efforts to protect farmland by deciding not to
provide federal assistance that would be used to convert farmland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wording of &sect;658.3(c) has been slightly modified from that of the proposed rule to clarify that any agency
policies or procedures for implementing the Act may be considered by an agency in deciding how to proceed with an activity.

F. Additional Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some federal agencies raised concerns as to actions subject to the Act. The current regulation, at &sect;658.2(c),
provides an exemption for federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs. Federal regulatory activities
are not considered as federal assistance that could convert farmland. Therefore, federal regulatory activities
are exempted from the Act. For example, in cases where a Clean Water Act section 404 permittee is required by the Corps
of Engineers to perform compensatory mitigation on farmed wetland, thereby converting the wetland actual or potential
use of farmland to a nonagricultural use, that conversion is not subject to FPPA. In complying with &sect;658.7 (a)
and (b), Federal agencies may identify those programs that they determine are not subject to the Act and provide details
on how other programs will be implemented consistent with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As further clarification, it should be noted that only those actions that will or could convert farmland to nonagricultural
uses are subject to the Act. Assistance provided to purchase, maintain, renovate, or replace a structure that already
exists is not subject to the Act, because any conversion of farmland took place at the time the structure was constructed.
The addition of minor new ancillary structures, such as garages or sheds, to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
serve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
existing structures is also not included under the Act. Even in cases where loans are made for new houses, that action
is not subject to the FPPA if the request for assistance and commitment by the federal agency was made after the house
was constructed. Likewise, once one Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA for the conversion of
a site, that agency's or a second Federal agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions
on the same site do not require additional, redundant FPPA analysis. Section 658.4(h) is being added to the final rule
to reflect this clarification.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several federal agencies cited concern for the application of the FPPA to land acquisitions by these agencies, providing
temporary, intermediate ownership by the Federal Government such as through foreclosure, the acquisition of assets
of an insolvent thrift institution or through forfeiture in criminal law enforcement proceedings. They expressed
concern for potential conflicts between their statutory responsibilities to obtain prompt, high value disposal
of these assets and the analysis procedures required under the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Federal program'' in the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4201(c)(4), extends the coverage of the FPPA to ``acquiring,
managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities.'' If an agency determines that its program does not result
in a sufficient acquisition of legal or equitable title by the United States to characterize the property as ``Federal
land or facilities,'' then the agency may exclude such land through its own policies and procedures for implementing
the FPPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department has determined that an interpretive clarification of the term ``Federal land and facilities''
as used in the definition of ``Federal programs'' covered by the FPPA would be useful. In that regard, the Department
believes that the use of the word ``Federal'' to modify the words ``land and facilities'' indicates an intent by Congress
to focus the scope of federal programs covered by the FPPA to lands and facilities acquired or managed by federal agencies
as necessary proprietary elements of federal programs, such as national forests, national parks, or military bases.
The use of the modifier ``Federal'' is significant; if the intent was to include the acquisition, management, or disposal
of any land or facility by a federal agency, regardless of the purpose of the use of the land or facility, Congress could
have omitted the modifier and simply stated, ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of lands and facilities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department has amended the definition of ``Federal program'' contained in &sect;658.2(c) to clarify
that, for the purposes of the FPPA and these regulations, the phrase ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of federal
lands and facilities'' refers to lands and facilities that are acquired, managed, or were used by a federal agency
specifically in support of a federal activity or program. It does not include lands or facilities that are acquired,
managed, or disposed of by a federal agency as the incidental result of actions by that agency through which the agency
has temporary ownership or custody of the land or facility, such as acquisition pursuant to a lien for delinquent taxes,
the exercise of conservationship or receivership authority, or the exercise of civil or criminal law enforcement
forfeiture or seizure authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has also incorporated in the definition of ``Federal program'' interpretive clarification that
loan guarantees or loan insurance of the construction of buildings or other structures is covered by the phrase ``undertaking,
financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects'' contained in the definition of ``Federal program.''
This interpretation was previously provided in the preamble of the final rule that promulgated the current regulations.
See 49 FR 27720, July 5, 1984. Further in this regard, the Department has clarified that the acquisition, management,
and disposal of land or facilities that a federal agency obtains as the result of foreclosure or other actions taken
under a loan, loan guarantee, or other financial assistance proved by the agency directly and specifically for that
property or facility is likewise within the definition of ``Federal program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A federal agency may develop and use procedures to implement the FPPA for its loan, loan guarantee, or other financial
assistance programs on either a specific project/loan basis or on the basis of an entire program. Further, if an agency
has conducted a FPPA review of a loan or other financial assistance for the conversion of farmland and the agency or
any other federal agency subsequently acquires the property related to that assistance, the previously conducted
FPPA review will be sufficient to constitute compliance with the FPPA for the management an eventual disposal of the
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More importantly, an agency may develop and use specific policies and procedures for the management and disposal
of property acquired through foreclosure, forfeiture, or other such means that taken into consideration its primary
statutory authorities regarding such properties. Clearly, these determinations can be best made by the particular
agencies involved through their respective FPPA policies and procedures, in consideration of the statutory requirements
under which they operate. The Department will consult with agencies, pursuant to section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C.
4203, to address these concerns.

Some federal agencies would like to exempt certain sites related to the expansion of existing linear projects that
would convert only a few acres of farmland but would avoid the conversion of a large number of acres. Some statewide
LESA systems currently include exemptions of 10 acres per bridge and 3 acres per mile on existing highways. The construction
of bridges and widening of existing highways is a farmland protection method. USDA will consult with Federal Highway
Administration, on actions that are designed to improve existing linear projects so as to avoid the conversion of
land that would occur if a new linear project were to be constructed.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Farmland
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means prime or unique farmlands as defined in section 1540(c)(1) of the Act or farmland that is determined by the appropriate
state or unit of local government agency or agencies with concurrence of the Secretary to be farmland of statewide
of local importance. ``Farmland'' does not include land already in or committed to urban development or water storage.
Farmland ``already in'' urban development or water storage includes all such land with a density of 30 structures
per 40-acre area. Farmland already in urban development also includes lands identified as ``urbanized area'' (UA)
on the Census Bureau Map, or as urban area mapped with a ``tint overprint'' on the USGS topographical maps, or as ``urban-built-up''
on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not ``farmland''
and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. Farmland ``committed to urban development or water storage'' includes
all such land that receives a combined score of 160 points or less from the land evaluation and site assessment criteria.

Federal program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means those activities or responsibilities of a Federal agency that involve undertaking, financing, or assisting
construction or improvement projects or acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The term ``Federal program'' does not include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs for activities on private or non-Federal lands; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) construction or improvement projects that were beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design
or construction state on August 4, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the purposes of this section, a project is considered to be ``beyond the planning stage and in either the active
design or construction state on August 4, 1984'' if, on or before that date, actual construction of the project had
commenced or:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) acquisition of land or easements for the project had occurred or all required Federal agency planning documents
and steps were completed and accepted, endorsed, or approved by the appropriate agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) a final environmental impact statement was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency or an environmental
assessment was completed and a finding of no significant impact was executed by the appropriate agency official;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the engineering or architectural design had begun or such services had been secured by contract. The phrase
``undertaking, financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects'' includes providing loan guarantees
or loan insurance for such projects and includes the acquisition, management and disposal of land or facilities that
a Federal agency obtains as the result of foreclosure or other actions taken under a loan or other financial assistance
provided by the agency directly and specifically for that property. For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``acquiring,
managing, or disposing of Federal lands and facilities'' refers to lands and facilities that are acquired, managed,
or used by a Federal agency specifically in support of a Federal activity or program, such as national parks, national
forests, or military bases, and does not refer to lands and facilities that are acquired by a Federal agency as the incidental
result of actions by the agency that give the agency temporary custody or ownership of the lands or facilities, such
as acquisition pursuant to a lien for delinquent taxes, the exercise of conservatorship or receivership authority,
or the exercise of civil or criminal law enforcement forfeiture or seizure authority.

(c) The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or
nonfederal land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. In cases where either a private party
or a nonfederal unit of government applies for federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural use, the
federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse effects
on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that would avoid or mitigate such adverse
effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the landowners want to proceed
with conversion, the federal agency, on the basis of the analysis set forth in &sect;658.4 and any agency policies
or procedures for implementing the Act, may provide or deny the requested assistance. Only assistance and actions
that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses are subject to this Act. Assistance and actions related to the
purchase, maintenance, renovation, or replacement of existing structures and sites converted prior to the time
of an application for assistance from a federal agency, including assistance and actions related to the construction
of minor new ancillary structures (such as garages or sheds), are not subject to the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 1548 of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 4209, states that the Act shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any
action, either legal or equitable, by any person or class of persons challenging a federal project, program, or other
activity that may affect farmland. Neither the Act nor this rule, therefore, shall afford any basis for such an action.
However, as further provided in section 1548, the governor of an affected state, where a state policy or program exists
to protect farmland, may bring an action in the federal district court of the district where a federal program is proposed
to enforce the requirements of section 1541 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202, and regulations issued pursuant to that section.

(a) An agency may determine whether or not a site is farmland as defined in &sect;658.2(a) or the agency may request
that SCS make such a determination. If an agency elects not to make its own determination, it should make a request to
SCS on Form AD&hyph;1006, the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, available at SCS offices, for determination
of whether the site is farmland subject to the Act. If neither the entire site nor any part of it are subject to the Act,
then the Act will not apply and SCS will so notify the agency. If the site is determined by SCS to be subject to the Act,
then SCS will measure the relative value of the site as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the information sources
listed in &sect;658.5(a). SCS will respond to these requests within 10 working days of their receipt except that in
cases where a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, SCS will respond in 30 working days. In the event
that SCS fails to complete its response within the required period, if further delay would interfere with construction
activities, the agency should proceed as though the site were not farmland.

each Federal agency is requested to report to the Chief of the Soil Conservation Service by November 15th of each year
on progress made during the prior fiscal year to implement sections 1542 (a) and (b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203 (a) and
(b). Until an agency fully implements those sections, the agency should continue to make the annual report, but may
omit the report upon full implementation. However, an agency is requested to file an annual report for any future year
in which the agency has substantially changed its process for compliance with the Act.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines
and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000.
A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended that the pack requirements for volume-filled containers
of California nectarines be revised, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended that the pack requirements
for volume-filled containers of California peaches be revised. These committees meet prior to and during each season
to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the
orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings.
The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and
determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

Section 916.350 (7 CFR 916.350, as amended at 59 FR 15838) specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine
shipments. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 specifies that nectarines in any closed package or container, except
master containers of consumer packages and individual consumer packages, shall be packed in accordance with ``standard
pack''. ``Standard pack'' is defined in paragraph (b) of &sect;916.350 as having the same meaning as set forth in the
United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines (7 CFR 51.3145 through 51.3160). Under the definition of ``standard
pack'', nectarines packed in certain containers must be tightly packed and the containers must be ``well filled''.
``Well filled'' means that the container is properly filled, allowing no movement of its contents, and the container
should have its contents in firm contact with the cover. This rule revises &sect;916.350 by adding a new proviso to
paragraph (a)(1) specifying that the nectarines in any such container need only be filled to within one inch of the
top of the container. This rule also removes the proviso in paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 reading ``That nectarines
in any container shall be fairly uniform in size'', because such requirements are included within the definition
of ``standard pack'' in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines, and therefore are not needed in this
paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 917.442 (7 CFR 917.442, as amended at 59 FR 15840) specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach
shipments. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.442 specifies that peaches in any closed package or container, except
master containers of consumer packages and individual consumer packages, shall be packed in certain containers
in accordance with ``standard pack''. ``Standard pack'' is defined in paragraph (b) of &sect;917.442 as having the
same meaning as set forth in the United States Standards for Grades of Peaches (7 CFR 51.1210 through 51.1223). Under
the definition of ``standard pack'', peaches in certain containers must be tightly packed and the containers must
be ``well filled''. ``Well filled'' means that the level of the fruit must be slightly higher than the top edge of the
container and the peaches are held firmly in place. This rule revises &sect;917.442 by adding a new proviso to paragraph
(a)(1) specifying that the peaches in any such container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC and PCC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers
after a comprehensive review of changes in the nectarine and peach industry packing practices over the years, and
the need to make appropriate changes in the pack requirements. When the pack requirements were established, most
containers were of a place-pack or a tray-pack type, but at the present time substantial quantities of nectarines
and peaches are shipped in volume-filled containers throughout the entire range of sizes packed. This revision will
provide handlers with more flexibility in selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled packs
without potential bruise damage to the fruit. Under current packing conditions, nectarines and peaches of certain
varieties and sizes are sometimes bruised when packed in accordance with ``standard pack'', because the fruit extends
above the top of the container and is damaged when the lid is attached. There are a combination of factors contributing
to this situation, including: (1) Handlers must pack a specific quantity of fruit, in terms of minimum weight, in certain
containers, and some handlers prefer to pack precisely this quantity in each such container; (2) the volume of fruit
packed in a particular container varies depending on the variety and size of fruit for a given pack weight; (3) handlers
maintain a limited number of different size containers in inventory; and (4) handlers pack most of their fruit at the
well matured stage of maturity, and such fruit is susceptible to bruising when packed too tight. This revision will
enable handlers to pack their nectarines and peaches with up to one inch space between the top of the fruit and the top
of the container, and result in less bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the pack requirements for
California nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers, as specified. The Department's determination
is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and
peaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule revises pack requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers, enabling
handlers to pack such fruit consistent with desirable packing practices, and is needed to help the California nectarine
and peach industries maintain the quality of fruit shipped to the fresh market. This rule is designed to establish
and maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) Shipment of the 1994 season crop of fresh California nectarines and peaches is currently underway; (2)
this rule relaxes pack requirements for both nectarines and peaches; (3) California nectarine and peach handlers
are aware of these revised pack requirements recommended by the committees at public meetings, and they will need
no additional time to comply with such requirements; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any written
comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule for 7 CFR 1755.525 was first published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a 7 CFR part 1762 proposed rule on October 29, 1989, at 54 FR 43429. Since that time part 1762 has been incorporated
into part 1755. Due to the pertinence of the comments received REA decided to incorporate many of them into the document.
The revised rule was published as a 7 CFR part 1755 proposed rule on March 14, 1991, at 56 FR 10827 with a 60 day comment
period. During this period comments and suggestions were received from six major manufacturers of central office
equipment. Many useful comments and suggestions were received and many of them have been incorporated into the revised
Form 525 Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last revision to the Form 525 Contract was September 1966. Since that date, significant changes have been made
in the telephone industry. The profound advancement in central office equipment technology has made possible many
new services on a cost effective basis. Divestiture and competition, legislation and regulation have brought about
many changes in the conduct of telecommunications business. The revised Form 525 Contract incorporates these changes
into the Central Office Equipment Contract. The main changes to the Contract are new requirements that: (1) Provide
for a software license, (2) provide for patent, copyright, and trademark infringement protection, (3) provide a
cap on consequential damages, and (4) provide Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. In addition, it revises
and updates provisions for (1) delivery and installation of equipment, (2) inspection and testing of the completed
installations, (3) payments to the contractor, (4) insurance, (5) liquidated damages, and (6) completion of the
project. This action will make it possible for REA telephone borrowers to continue to provide their subscribers with
the most modern and efficient telephone service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA has issued a series of 7 CFR chapter XVII parts which serve to implement the policies, procedures, and requirements
for administering its loan and loan guarantee programs and the loan documents and security instruments which provide
for and secure REA financing. The technical change to 7 CFR part 1753 updates the number of days allowed for acceptance
testing in order to conform with REA Form 525 Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation). The revision
to 7 CFR part 1755 codifies REA Form 525, Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation). The 7 CFR part
1755 also describes where copies of the contract may be obtained. REA telephone borrowers are required to use the REA
Form 525 Contract where major central office facilities are being procured and installed under contract. The present
REA Form 525 has become outdated due to technological advancements and other reasons. Advanced technology and equipment
concepts have introduced new issues. Contract terms and obligations need to be modified and updated to more accurately
reflect present business practices. Some representative issues addressed in updating this contract are: Expansion

Public comments were received from Alcatel Network Systems, Inc., AT&amp;T Network Systems, Mitel Public Switching,
Northern Telecom Inc., Redcom Laboratories, Inc., and Seimens Stromberg-Carlson. The comments, recommendations
and responses are summarized as follows:

General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that a telephone central office switch is a computer and should be purchased using a supply
type contract rather than a construction contract and therefore, REA Form 525 should not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels that due to the very complex nature and individuality of each central office and the immense amount of coordination
and development that must be done prior to, during, and after the installation a supply type contract would not be a
suitable instrument to achieve the desired results. Further, REA feels a supply type contract does not provide the
Borrower the same degree of protection as the REA Form 525 Contract. This lack of protection could be devastating to
the Borrower and consequently, jeopardize REA loan security. The required use of REA Form 525, Central Office Equipment
Contract (Including Installation), remains.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Item 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the Owner should be responsible for providing a notice that the state requires a license
for bidding, if such a requirement exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Bidder is the party who ultimately will have to abide by the State's licensing requirements, REA believes
the Bidder should bear the responsibility for determining whether a license is required for bidding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Item 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the method of bidding in the existing REA Form 525 makes bid bonds optional and the proposed
REA Form 525 removes this option. They feel that the option should remain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing REA Form 525, Notice and Instructions to Bidders, Item 5, and the proposed REA Form 525, Notice and Instructions
to Bidders, Item 6, specifically state that each proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond or a certified check. No
other option exists. The wording in both documents is essentially the same.

Item 14: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) One commenter remarked that this requirement adds complexity and administrative burden because the manufacturers
are already required to comply with REA Form 525, Article VI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Item 14(b) is required by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) requirement.

Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters questioned the use of the term ``Delivery Acceptance'' in column five of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Column five is the time in calendar days between approval of the Contract and delivery of equipment. The term ``Acceptance''
has been removed from this column to more clearly define the requirement.

Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that there should be some instruction as to how to identify each project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA agrees. REA has added Note 3 to Article I, section 1, as an instruction to leave a blank line between each Project
listed in section 1.

Section 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the word ``substantial'' should be replaced and one commenter remarked that the language
``The Owner *&blank;*&blank;* may *&blank;*&blank;* make reasonable changes, additions to or subtractions from
the Specifications *&blank;*&blank;*'' is ambiguous and should be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is the same language that is in the existing REA Form 525 Contract. It has worked well in the past and REA does not
feel there is a need to change it.

Article II, Delivery and Installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the draft REA Form 525 made the Completion of Installation of the essence. The commenter
feels that Completion of the Project should be of the essence, since liquidated damages are measured from that event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Completion of Installation is a scheduled date that must be met. The scheduled date for the Completion of the Project,
as shown in Article I, Section 1, Column 7, is established by adding 60 days to the Completion of Installation. Liquidated
Damages are measured from the scheduled date for Completion of the Project. Actual Completion of the Project may be
a date earlier or later than the scheduled date of Completion of the Project as defined in Article VII, Section 1, Definitions.
Therefore, REA believes that Completion of Installation must be of the essence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that if a remote switching terminal is scheduled independently of a central office, the Contract
should reflect this as a separate Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article I, Section 1, and the Contract in general, regard a central office, including all associated remote switching
terminals, to be an indivisible unit for delivery, payment, turnover, closeout, liquidated damages, and other purposes.
A host office and its remotes are interdependent and alterations to one may affect the others. Therefore, REA regards
a host office and all associated remotes as one item under the Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the reference to ``the satisfaction of the Owner and the Administrator'' is a subjective
standard and should be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the language in question is deleted, the Section would require unconditional adherence to the terms of the Contract.
The language is included here to allow the possibility of latitude, where the Owner and REA agree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter had the following remarks: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the first sentence the wording ``give sufficient supervision to'' should be changed to ``supervise.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Also, this commenter feels the language ``using Bidder's best skill and attention'' is onus and unenforceable
and should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The commenter also feels the second sentence should be expanded to include the following language ``but that
the failure of the Bidder to discover these items shall not create any obligation or liability on the part of the Bidder,
nor relieve the Owner of its performance or responsibilities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels that the existing language is appropriate. REA disagrees with the expansion of the second sentence since
REA believes it is reasonable for the Bidder to be responsible for the fulfillment of the Contract requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter had the following remarks: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The reference to ``manufacturing'' in the first paragraph should be replaced with ``other than cost information
or any other information from which cost could be derived.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The commenter also suggests the language ``each central office (and its associated remote switching terminals),
feature or service'' be replaced with the word ``Project'' as a potential exists for a remote to be scheduled as a separate
Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In addition, the commenter feels the word ``nonperformance'' in the fourth paragraph should be replaced with
``failure to satisfactorily resolve all such deficiencies as previously listed on the REA Form 517.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) REA feels the language in the first paragraph offers sufficient protection to the Bidder as written. This language
has not been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As previously responded to, Article I, Section 1, and the Contract in general, regard a central office, including
all associated remote switching terminals, to be an indivisible unit. However, in the interest of brevity, this language
has been replaced with the word ``Project.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) REA agrees and has revised Article II, section 4, paragraph 4 to include the suggested language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the fourth paragraph of this Section imposes an artificial thirty (30) day requirement
for correction of deficiencies. They suggest the Section be amended to require corrections within thirty (30) days
of receipt of the REA Form 517 from the Borrower or by the scheduled date for Completion of the Project, whichever is
longer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA feels this Section offers the Bidder and the Borrower equal protection by imposing specific time limits for the
Borrower's tests and the Bidder's corrections. This language has not been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the first paragraph of this Section should be modified to permit the Bidder either to correct
the defect within 30 days or to agree with the Borrower during such 30 days on a course of correction reasonably designed
to cure the defect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA agrees. This Section has been revised to allow an extension of time if agreed upon by the Owner and REA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that refund and credit options should be included in the event a defect cannot reasonably be
corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such a provision would give the Bidder the right to simply ``buy back'' equipment or software when a problem is encountered.
To the Borrower, this means that essential features or capability could be lost and would remain unavailable for the
entire useful life of new switching equipment. The resulting reduction in value of the Contract to the borrower cannot
be predicted. This option has not been added to Form 525.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that minor ``bugs'' are inherent in all software and should not rise to the level of warranty
defects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter remarked that the Form 522 Specifications and not other technical material provided by the Bidder
should be the standard for software warranty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA feels the performance of the software must be in accordance with the Form 522 Specifications and Bidder documentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bidder documentation is furnished to assist the borrower in the operation, administration and maintenance of
the switch.

Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters remarked that this Section should be rewritten to add disclaimers and exclusive remedies and to
limit the Bidder's liabilities and limit the Owner's remedies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Section 7(b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters remarked that the warranty period for software should be shortened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA requires a five (5) year warranty period because software is information based and defects in seldom used programs
would not be detected until the program is used. REA believes that over a 5 year period even seldom used programs would
be used and any defects corrected.

Section 1(a),(b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that these subsections are unfair as written. Each central office and its associated remotes
should be treated separately for payment purposes to allow the Bidder to get paid for his investment in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article I, Section 1, and the Contract in general, regard a central office, including all associated remote switching
terminals, to be an indivisible unit for delivery, payment, turnover, closeout, liquidated damages, and other purposes.
A host office and its remotes are interdependent and alterations to one may affect the others. Therefore, REA regards

Section 1(c):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the phrase ``Completion of the Contract'' in this subsection should be changed to read
``Completion of the Project.'' This would enable the Bidder to receive the final ten percent (10%) for each Project
as it is satisfactorily completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These have been the standard REA Contract terms for many years. REA feels it offers sufficient protection to the Borrower
that the Contract will be completed in a satisfactory manner, while allowing the Bidder a return on its investment
prior to satisfactory completion of the Contract. Also, the Bidder can receive the final ten percent (10%) of a Project
if the partial closeout procedure is allowed.

Section 1(a), (b), (c):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that unproven features and capabilities should not delay payments for the Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unproven features and capabilities are listed as separate Projects in Article I, section 1, with separate time frames
for delivery and installation of features and capabilities that cannot be provided at the time of Completion of the
Project. If separate schedules are not part of the Contract, delays in delivery would cause delays in payments for
the entire Project. This encourages a Bidder's disclosures as required in Article V, section 2.

Section 1(b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters remarked that this Section is unfair to the Bidder. They feel that the Bidder should only be responsible
for damages caused by the Bidder and that the Borrower is in a much better position to protect its site, and guard against
fire, flood and theft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bidder is required by law to have insurance from commencement to completion of the Contract. The Bidder also has
charge and control of all work, equipment, materials and software to be done or used therein. Therefore, REA feels
the Bidder is in a better position during this time period to protect itself against risk of loss.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that commercial insurance is unnecessary. Specifically, the coverage limits required are
within the ``deductible'' for large companies. Thus the risk is self retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Insurance requirements for contractors are set forth in 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, Insurance for Contractors, Engineers
and Architects. Generally, this regulation is intended to set minimum coverage requirements for companies of all
sizes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA agrees. A Uniform Software License was drafted and published for comments on May 20, 1993, at 58 FR 29363, and was
published as a final rule on April 14, 1994, at 59 FR 17675. The final rule will be an addendum to any 525 or 545 Contract
that requires a license.

 One commenter remarked that some guarantees may not be transferable or assignable by the Bidder and this Section should
be subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer or assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article IV, section 6 has been revised to allow for restrictions on transfer of warranties. However, regardless of
restrictions upon transfer or assignment, the warranty coverage defined in Article II, section 7, is required.

Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters remarked that a buy back option should be allowed for infringement of intellectual property rights.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such a provision would give the Bidder the right simply to ``buy back'' equipment or software when a copyright problem
is encountered. To the Owner, this means that essential features or capability could be lost and would remain unavailable
for the entire useful life of the new switching equipment. The resulting reduction in value of the Contract to the Owner
cannot be predicted, and often would be greater than the amount the Owner paid for the price of the infringing equipment
or software.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the Bidder should be allowed to take pro-active steps to avoid an injunction, rather than
always having to react to an injunction after it is imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section merely states the action the Bidder must take to protect the Owner after the use of the equipment or software
is enjoined. It does not proscribe any action the Bidder may wish to take to protect its own interests and the Owner's
interests before the injunction is granted.

Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters remarked that the cap on liquidated damages is excessive and unrelated to any actual damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA believes that if a limit is to be set it should not be less than the price of the affected central office and all associated
remote switching units. This in many cases will be less than the total Contract price. This Section also instructs
the Owner to notify the Bidder in writing how the liquidated damages were computed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that previous draft versions of the 525 Central Office Equipment Contract better defined
``placed in service'' and assumes liquidated damages are applied based on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA believes that the wording ``used by the Owner to earn revenue'' more clearly defines ``placed in service.'' Article
V, sections 2 and 5, and Article VII, section 1, Definitions, clearly state that liquidated damages can only be assessed
and are the exclusive remedy when the Bidder has failed to complete the Project on time and are not based on when a central
office is placed in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that the Bidder should not be assessed liquidated damages based on the entire Project when
a only a portion is delayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated previously, the central office and all associated remote switching terminals are a unit for the purposes
of this Contract. Liquidated damages are measured from ``Completion of Project.'' This gives the Bidder an incentive
to complete the Project in a timely manner. If liquidated damages were assessed on each individual part of a Project,
then in some cases the incentive to finish the Project on time would be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that liquidated damages should not apply to features or capabilities that are not fully developed
or do not have a verifiable satisfactory field performance because they have been accepted by the Owner and by definition
they are unproven. It was also felt that even if they are not exempt, liquidated damages should not apply if the central
office has been placed in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Owner allowed these unproven features to be bid based on a time period established by the Bidder for the availability
of these features. A Bidder's responsibility to provide the features or capabilities bid on, in the time period established
by the Bidder, cannot be diminished by notifying the Owner that they are not going to be available in the time promised.
The language in Article V, section 2, remains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquidated damages on unproven features are a measure of revenue that would be lost by that feature not being available
on time. It does not have a bearing on, and should not be associated with, revenue from the rest of the Project that is
in service. If it was as suggested in the comment, then it would be a penalty to the Owner in lost revenue for the Bidder
not completing the feature or capability as scheduled.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA feels the existing language clearly identifies the intent of this provision. Also, a Bidder's responsibility
to complete the Project as originally bid should not be diminished because of neglect by the Bidder to notify the Owner
of unproven or unavailable features or capabilities. The last sentence remains.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four commenters remarked on this section. From the comments received, it appears this section is still of great concern
to the equipment manufacturers. The comments and recommendations received are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Two commenters remarked that ten times the Contract price is excessive. Three commenters remarked that they should
be able to disclaim consequential damages. Two commenters remarked that that much exposure is probably not insurable
but if it was, the premiums would be excessive and would be passed on to the Owner. One commenter recommended that consequential
damages be the lesser of five times the purchase price of the affected central office and its associated remote terminals,
or $5.0 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) One commenter recommended that the Owner retain the liability since the Owner is in a better position to prevent
losses by properly maintaining its network. One commenter felt that consequential damages should only be available
during the warranty period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The existing Form 525 does not limit the liability for incidental or consequential damages. REA's intent is to
place a limit of liability on consequential and incidental damages, except for personal injury or tangible property
damage, which will: enable Bidders to insure for a risk of known limit; provide Owners with protection against losses
related to product failure; protect the government's loan security; and serve as a standard that Bidders and Owners
alike can expect to see on every Contract so competitive bidding can be facilitated. REA has established a liability
limit of ten times the total Contract amount, which will result in a limit in the range of $2.5 million to $10 million
for typical REA Contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consequential damages provide a measure of protection from loss due to product failure or other causes related
to the Bidder's performance. Since the risk of loss still exists after the warranty period, consequential damages
must also be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that in order to make the proposed draft consistent with the suggested addition of exclusive
remedies language in other sections, some minor language adjustments are needed for this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA has not added exclusive remedy language so no language adjustments were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 5:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that cumulative remedies should not apply for a normal warranty claim. The warranty provisions
of the Contract provide for a remedy and course of conduct in the event of a product failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The warranty provisions may not fully protect the Borrower in some situations. For example, a defective component,
serviced under Article II, section 6, could cause a consequential damages claim. The language in section 5 is unchanged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that a number of large national employers have made direct arrangements with the Office of

and language should be added to this Article VI to cover separately negotiated arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt the definition of Software should be expanded to clarify that Software means the Software provided
to the Owner by the Bidder hereunder and the words ``and similar design level documentation'' should be inserted after
the words ``source code'' in this subsection. It was also felt that the definition of Project should be expanded to
include remote switching terminal(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels the definition of the term ``Software'' is appropriate as written and will not be construed to mean any software
other than the software furnished for the Contract in question. The words ``and similar design level documentation''
have not been added to the words ``source code.'' Source code is a definable commodity but ``and similar *&blank;*&blank;*.''
is overly vague. REA also feels the definition of the word ``Project'' is sufficient. If a remote is to be a separate
Project, it must be listed as such in Article 1, section 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter is concerned that the Owner's failure to provide site availability and needed facilities for remotes
can unduly hold up Completion of the Project. The commenter proposed adding language to cover that event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels the definition of ``Completion of the Project'' is appropriate. The concerns of ``Site availability or
functionality'' not being available in a timely manner is covered under Article II, section 1, Time of Completion
of Installation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters remarked on this section. Their comments are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One commenter remarked that this Section still requires that equipment and software support be provided for five
or eight years from discontinuing the manufacture of that Equipment. The commenter feels this time period should
commence upon Completion of the Contract. It is felt this provision as drafted would penalize Bidders which enhance
and manufacture existing equipment and reward Bidders who discontinue manufacture of equipment and develop new
and incompatible equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) One commenter wanted to revise the language to change the intent of this paragraph and also add a provision for
a one (1) year software warranty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA previously responded in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on March 14, 1991, at 56 FR 10827, that it concludes, based on previous comments, that this new Section strikes a reasonable
balance for sellers and buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that its only area of concern arises in a two fold fashion. To begin with, the use of the word ``and''
following the word ``substantially'' in the first sentence interferes with the intended meaning of the sentence,
and as such, should be deleted. The specific concern arises from the wording of this section 3, Notwithstanding the
possibility of authorization by the Administrator, it suggests that such authorization is permissive, not mandatory
and that therefore the intent of REA Bulletin 344&hyph;3 is not met. The commenter submits that such authorization
be mandatory in the event the valuation conditions of the Bulletin are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The word ``and'' following ``substantially'' in the first sentence is a typographical error and has been changed
to ``all.'' In regard to the Administrator's authorization being permissive, the Administrator's authorization
is not required when the conditions of Bulletin 344&hyph;3 are met. It is only required when the conditions of Bulletin
344&hyph;3, paragraph IV.B. or IV.C. are not met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that the proposed draft has added a new sentence to this section which releases the borrower
from its obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the Bidder's proprietary information if the Bidder fails
to fulfill its continuing support obligations. The commenter believes the proposed remedy for such a problem is overly
broad and is punitive to the Bidder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA feels this section offers sufficient protection for the Bidder and the Owner. The only way the Owner can be released
from the confidentiality requirement is by the Bidder's failure to meet the obligations of the Form 525 Contract.
Article VI, section 6, as proposed, provides some incentive not to violate the obligations of the Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 12: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the Bidder not be required to obtain the consent of its surety for all sub-contractors.
It is felt that if the surety makes such a requirement on the Bidder, this language adds nothing to the Bidder's obligation
to obtain proper protection. On the other hand, if such a condition is not required by the surety, there should be no
need to retain this condition.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only way the REA and the Owner can be assured that the surety allows subcontractors is by written consent. The language
in this section remains unchanged.

Section 12: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter remarked that either party should be permitted to subcontract the Agreement to an affiliate without
the consent of the other party. A corporate restructuring of a Bidder should not be able to be arbitrarily held up by
a single Owner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA does not feel that a Bidder should be allowed to arbitrarily subcontract an REA Contract without the proper consent,
which will not be unreasonably withheld. This language has worked well in the past and REA feels it will continue to
work well in the future.

to the site for the sole purpose of assisting in these tests. Acceptance tests shall be performed within 30 days of completion
of the installation, unless otherwise requested in writing by the contractor and approved in writing by the borrower.

for the purpose of receiving the Bidder's Technical Proposal, discussing details of the Project(s), and considering
suggestions from Bidders. The Owner shall attach to this Notice a list of the information required in the Bidder's
Technical Proposal. Each Bidder will be given a specific time period for the pre-bid technical session. At the pre-bid
technical session, the Bidder shall fully describe to the Owner any exceptions to the Specifications the Bidder may
request. In addition, the Bidder shall identify all features and capabilities that are not fully developed or do not
have a verifiable satisfactory field performance record. If the Owner decides to incorporate any changes into the
Specifications, the Owner shall furnish all prospective Bidders a copy of the Specifications containing such revisions
(the ``Revised Specifications'') and all Bids shall be made on the basis of the Revised Specifications. At this session,
the Bidder shall identify all documentation and materials that it claims constitute agreed excluded documentation
under section (2)(xi) of the Software License. The Bidder shall claim as agreed excluded documentation only those
items it may be unable to provide to the Borrower as required by said section (2)(xi). The Engineer shall immediately
provide a list of all items so identified to [appropriate REA office]. The Engineer shall inform the Bidder at least

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 days before the scheduled bid opening whether either the Engineer or [REA] will reject the Bid because of items so identified.
Licensor agrees that certain Licensed Software cannot be excluded from the requirements of said section (2)(xi),
including but not limited to software that would significantly impair the operation of the System, would significantly
impair the ability of the Owner to generate revenue, or would pose a risk to REA loan security. If allowed, the agreed
excluded documentation shall be individually identified in an attachment to the Bid. No bid shall be accepted from
a Bidder who fails to attend the pre-bid technical session or fails to demonstrate to the Owner that its equipment meets
the requirements of the Plans and Specifications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Proposals shall be submitted on the forms furnished by the Owner and must be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed
to the Owner. The name and address of the Bidder, its license number, if a license is required for bidding on a project
by the State, and the date and hour of the opening of bids must appear on the envelope in which the Proposal is submitted.
Proposals must be in ink or typewritten. No alterations or interlineations will be permitted, unless made, initialed,
and dated before submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Prior to the submission of the Proposal, the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to have made a careful examination
of the Specifications, forms of Bidder's Proposal and Acceptance, and Contractor's Bond attached hereto, and shall
become informed as to the location and characteristics of the proposed central office and remote terminal installations,
features and services, the transportation facilities, the kind of facilities required before and during the delivery
and installation of the equipment and materials, the general local conditions and all other matters that may affect
the cost and the time of completion of the installations. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes,
codes, and regulations, including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors and the ``Anti Kick-Back Acts,''
as amended, (40 U.S.C. 276c; 41 U.S.C. 51 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations issued pursuant thereto, and 18 U.S.C. 287, 874, 1001, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond, in the form attached, or a certified check on a bank that is a member
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
of the maximum possible bid price. The maximum possible bid price is the sum of the total base bid, spare parts, maintenance
tools and all positive amounts for alternates. Each Bidder agrees that, if its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals,
its Bid Bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and Contractor's Bond, when required, is
furnished by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not
to exceed ninety (90) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals whichever period shall be the
shorter. If such Proposal is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned to the Bidder within
a period of thirty (30) days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The successful Bidder will be required to furnish to the Owner a Contractor's Bond in conformance with the requirements
of 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, Insurance for Contractors, Engineers, and Architects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to furnish a Contractor's Bond within thirty (30) days after written
notification of the award of the Contract by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal.
In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified
check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference (not
exceeding the amount of the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the
Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project(s). The term ``successful Bidder'' shall
be deemed to include any Bidder whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been
unable to execute the Contract or to furnish a Contractor's Bond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If requested by the Owner or the Administrator, the Bidder shall furnish evidence, satisfactory to the Owner and
the Administrator, that the Bidder has the necessary facilities, ability, and financial resources to perform the
Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Contract, when executed, shall be deemed to include the entire agreement between the parties thereto and neither
party shall claim any modification thereof resulting from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer,
agent, or employee of the other or by any other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal, if it appears to the
Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived
must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the execution of any Contract which may be awarded thereon.
Failure to provide a Bid Bond or check as specified in item six (6) above is not a minor irregularity.

These goals are applicable to all the Contractor's construction work (whether or not it is federal or federally assisted)
performed in the covered area. If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside
of the covered area, it shall apply the goals established for such geographical area where work is actually performed.
With regard to this second area, the Contractor also is subject to the goals for both its federally involved and nonfederally
involved construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Contractor's compliance with Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1963&hyph;1965 Comp., p. 340) and the regulations
in 41 CFR part 60&hyph;4 shall be based on its implementation of the Equal Opportunity Clause, specific affirmative
action obligations required by the specifications set forth in 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.3(a), and its efforts to meet the
goals. The hours of minority and female employment and training must be substantially uniform throughout the length
of the contract, and in each trade, and the Contractor shall make a good faith effort to employ minorities and women
evenly on each of its projects. Transfer of minority or female employees or trainees from Contractor to Contractor
or from project to project for the sole purpose of meeting the Contractor's goals shall be a violation of the contract,
Executive Order 11246 and the regulations in 41 CFR part 60&hyph;4. Compliance with the goals will be measured against
the total work hours performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Contractor shall provide written notification to the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs within 10 working days of award of any construction subcontract in excess of $10,000 at any tier for construction
work under the contract resulting from this solicitation. The notification shall list the name, address and telephone
number of the subcontractor; employer identification number of the subcontractor; estimated dollar amount of the
subcontract; estimated starting and completion dates of the subcontract; and the geographical area in which the
subcontract is to be performed.

Section 2. Acceptable Equipment. Unless otherwise specified by the Owner (and agreed to in advance in writing by REA),
the Bidder agrees to furnish under this Proposal only equipment which is currently covered by a letter of acceptance
issued by the Chairman, Committee ``A'' (Telephone). [Note: for convenience of borrowers and others, domestically

Section 3. Changes in Project. The Owner, with the approval of the Administrator, may from time to time during the performance
of the Contract effected by the acceptance of this Proposal, make reasonable changes, additions to or subtractions
from the Specifications which are part of the Proposal as conditions may warrant. However, if substantial changes
in the Project shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Bidder shall make a
written request therefor to the Owner within thirty (30) days after any such change is made. Further, if the cost to
the Bidder shall be increased or decreased by any such change or addition, the Contract price shall be increased or
decreased by a reasonable amount in accordance with a contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved
by the Administrator. No claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless
the Bidder shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with
such change or addition. The Delivery or Completion of Installation times specified under Columns 5, ``Delivery'',
and 6, ``Completion of Installation,'' in Article I, section 1, can only be changed by a Contract amendment approved

Section 1. Time of Completion of Installation. The time of delivery of materials, equipment, and software and of Completion
of Installation are of the essence of this Contract. The Bidder shall deliver the materials, equipment, and software
required hereunder for each Project upon the time intervals established under Column 5, ``Delivery,'' in Article
I, section 1, after the Administrator shall have approved this Contract in writing, and shall prosecute diligently
and complete the installation of materials, equipment and software for each Project in accordance with the terms
of this Contract and Specifications to the satisfaction of the Owner and the Administrator within the number of calendar
days specified under Column 6, ``Completion of Installation,'' in Article I, section 1. The times for such Delivery
or such Completion of Installation shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay due exclusively to causes
beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires, strikes,
floods, changes in the Specifications as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters
for which the Owner is solely responsible. However, no such extension of time shall be granted the Bidder unless within
thirty (30) days after Bidder becomes aware of the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension
of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner. Further, no delay in such time for delivery
of materials, equipment and software or Completion of Installation or in the progress of the work shall result in any
liability on the part of the Owner, except that the Owner shall be responsible for and shall pay the Bidder on demand
all additional, supportable costs and expenses incurred by the Bidder due to delays to the extent such delays are caused
by the Owner's failure to perform its obligations under this Contract unless the Owner's failure to perform is caused
by forces beyond its control.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1. Completion on Bidder's Default. If default shall be made by the Bidder in the performance of any of the work
hereunder, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable remedies in the circumstances, may serve
upon the Bidder and the surety or sureties upon the Bidder's Bond or Bonds a written notice requiring the Bidder to cause
such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within thirty (30) days after the service of such notice upon the Bidder
such default shall be corrected or arrangements for the correction thereof, satisfactory to both the Owner and the
Administrator, shall have been made by the Bidder or its surety or sureties, the Owner may take over the performance
of the Bidder's obligations hereunder and prosecute the same to completion by contract or otherwise for the account
and at the expense of the Bidder, and the Bidder and its surety or sureties shall be liable to the Owner for any supportable
cost or expense in excess of the bid price occasioned thereby. In such event, the Owner may take possession of and utilize,
in completing the Project(s), any tools, supplies, equipment, appliances and plant belonging to the Bidder which
may be situated at the site of the Project(s). The Owner, in such contingency, may exercise any rights, claims or demands
which the Bidder may have against third persons in connection herewith and for such purpose the Bidder does hereby
assign, transfer and set over unto the Owner all such rights, claims and demands.

time, if any, herein provided, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness damages
caused by such delay, the Owner shall, so long as the subject Project shall not have been placed in service, have the
right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys which may be then due, or which may become due and payable to the Bidder,

Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount claimed as liquidated
damages was computed. The Bidder shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment in full. Such payment
is not to be reduced by the value of any partial performance by the Bidder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
At the technical sessions, each Bidder shall identify all features and capabilities that are not fully developed
or do not have a verifiable satisfactory field performance record. If the Owner allows these features to be bid as separate
Projects, then they are to be individually listed under Columns 1 through 10, in Article I, section 1. These unproven
features and capabilities are to be individually listed in this section 2 also, with liquidated damages amounts determined
by the Owner and stated for each. If a Bidder neglects to identify any such feature at the technical session, delay in
providing the feature is considered a delay in completing the associated Project and the Owner may assess liquidated
damages listed for that Project regardless of whether the Project is placed in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3. Consequential Damages. In no event shall the Bidder's liability for incidental or consequential loss
or damage, except for personal injury or tangible property damage, exceed the amount of ten times the total contract
price, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or enforce any remedy which the Owner may exercise or enforce hereunder.

Section 5. Cumulative Remedies. Every right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Owner or the Administrator
shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every right and remedy now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
by statute and the pursuit of any right or remedy shall not be construed as an election. Provided, however, that the
provisions of section 2 of this Article V shall be the exclusive measure of damages for failure by the Bidder to have
effected the Completion of Project within the time herein agreed upon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, furnished the Equal Employment Opportunity Employers Information Report EEO&hyph;1, Standard Form 100, required
of employers with 100 or more employees pursuant to Executive Order 11246 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Bidder agrees that it will obtain, prior to the award of any subcontract for more than $10,000 hereunder to a
subcontractor with 100 or more employees, a statement, signed by the proposed subcontractor, that the proposed subcontractor
has filed a current report on Standard Form 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Bidder agrees that if it has 100 or more employees and has not submitted a report on Standard Form 100 for the current
reporting year and that if this contract will amount to more than $10,000, the Bidder will file such report, as required
by law, and notify the Owner in writing of such filing prior to the Owner's acceptance of this Proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Bidder certifies that it does not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of
its establishments, and that it does not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under its
control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder certifies further that it will not maintain or provide
for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it will not permit its employees
to perform their services at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. The Bidder
agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity Clause in this contract. As used
in this certification, the term ``segregated facilities'' means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms,
restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots,
drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees
which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national
origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. The Bidder agrees that (except where it has obtained identical
certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time periods) it will obtain identical certifications
from proposed subcontractors prior to the award of subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions
of the Equal Opportunity Clause, and that it will retain such certifications in its files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2. During the performance of this contract, the Contractor agrees as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color,
religion, sex or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed,
and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment
or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for
training, including apprenticeship. The Contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places available to employees
and applicants for employment, notices to be provided setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the Contractor,
state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion,
sex or national origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which the Bidder has a collective
bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided advising the said labor union or
workers' representative of the Contractor's commitments under this section, and shall post copies of the notice
in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and of the rules,
regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965,
and by rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to the Contractor's
books, records and accounts by the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation
to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations and orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In the event of the Contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any
of the said rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated or suspended in whole or in part
and the Contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts or federally assisted construction
contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other
sanctions as may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in the said Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965,
or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Contractor will include the portion of the sentence immediately preceding paragraph (a) and the provisions
of paragraphs (a) through (g) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations or orders
of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to Section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such
provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The Contractor will take such action with respect to
any subcontract or purchase order as the administering agency may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions,
including actions for noncompliance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
that in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor
as a result of such direction by the administering agency, the Contractor may request the United States to enter into
such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Covered area'' means the geographical area described in the solicitation from which this contract resulted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Director'' means Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, United States Department of Labor,
or any person to whom the Director delegates authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Employer identification number'' means the Federal Social Security number used on the Employer's Quarterly Federal
Tax Return, U.S. Treasury Department Form 941; and

``Minority'' includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Black (all persons having origins in any of the Black African racial groups not of Hispanic origin); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American or other Spanish Culture or
origin, regardless of race); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast
Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of North America
and maintaining identifiable tribal affiliations through membership and participation or community identification).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Whenever the Contractor, or any Subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts a portion of the work involving any construction
trade, it shall physically include in each subcontract in excess of $10,000 the provisions of these specifications
and the Notice which contains the applicable goals for minority and female participation and which is set forth in
the solicitations from which this contract resulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the Contractor is participating (pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.5) in a Hometown Plan approved by the U.S. Department
of Labor in the covered area either individually or through an association, its affirmative action obligations on
all work in the Plan area (including goals and timetables) shall be in accordance with that Plan for those trades which
have unions participating in the Plan. Contractors must be able to demonstrate their participation in and compliance
with the provisions of any such Hometown Plan. Each Contractor or Subcontractor participating in an approved Plan
is individually required to comply with its obligations under the EEO clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve
each goal under the Plan in each trade in which it has employees. The overall good faith performance by other Contractors
or Subcontractors toward a goal in an approved Plan does not excuse any covered Contractor's or Subcontractor's failure
to take good faith efforts to achieve the Plan goals and timetables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor shall implement the specific affirmative action standards provided in paragraphs (g) (i) through
(xvi) of these specifications. The goals set forth in the solicitation from which this contract resulted are expressed
as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization the Contractor should
reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area. Covered construction
contractors performing construction work in geographical areas where they do not have a federal or federally assisted
construction contract shall apply the minority and female goals established for the geographical area where the
work is being performed. Goals are published periodically in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in notice form, and such notices may be obtained from any Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs office or
from Federal procurement contracting officers. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress
in meeting its goals in each craft during the period specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with whom the Contractor
has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer either minorities or women shall excuse the Contractor's obligations
under these specifications, Executive Order 11246, or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, such
apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the Contractor must have
made a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability
of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department
of Labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Contractor shall take specific affirmative actions to ensure equal employment opportunity. The evaluation
of the Contractor's compliance with these specifications shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results
from its actions. The Contractor shall document these efforts fully, and shall implement affirmative action steps
at least as extensive as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Ensure and maintain a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites, and in
all facilities at which the Contractor's employees are assigned to work. The Contractor, where possible, will assign
two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall specifically ensure that all foremen, superintendents,
and other on-site supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a
working environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals working at such sites or in such facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Establish and maintain a current list of minority and female recruitment sources, provide written notification
to minority and female recruitment sources and to community organizations when the Contractor or its unions have
employment opportunities available, and maintain a record of the organizations' responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Maintain a current file of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street
applicant and minority or female referral from a union, a recruitment source or community organization and of what
action was taken with respect to each such individual. If such individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral
and was not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred, not employed by the Contractor, this shall
be documented in the file with the reason therefore, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have
taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Provide immediate written notification to the Director when the union or unions with which the Contractor has
a collective bargaining agreement has not referred to the Contractor a minority person or woman sent by the Contractor,
or when the Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts
to meet its obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area which expressly
include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to
the Contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The
Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under (g)(ii) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy by providing notice of the policy to unions and training programs and
requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its EEO obligations; by including it in any policy
manual and collective bargaining agreement; by publicizing it in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.; by
specific review of the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once
a year; and by posting the company EEO policy on bulletin boards accessible to all employees at each location where
construction work is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Review, at least annually, the company's EEO policy and affirmative action obligations under these specifications
with all employees having any responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination or other employment decisions
including specific review of these items with onsite supervisory personnel such as Superintendents, General Foremen,
etc., prior to the initiation of construction work at any job site. A written record shall be made and maintained identifying
the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject
matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Disseminate the Contractor's EEO policy externally by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically
including minority and female news media, and providing written notification to and discussing the Contractor's
EEO policy with other Contractors and Subcontractors with whom the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Direct its recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female and community organizations, to
schools with minority and female students and to minority and female recruitment and training organizations serving
the Contractor's recruitment area and employment needs. Not later than one month prior to the date for the acceptance
of applications for apprenticeship or other training by any recruitment source, the Contractor shall send written
notification to organizations such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be
used in the selection process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(x) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other minority persons and women and, where reasonable,
provide after school, summer and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the site and in other areas
of a Contractor's work force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Validate all tests and other selection requirements where there is an obligation to do so under 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;3.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female personnel for promotional
opportunities and encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., such
opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiii) Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments and other personnel practices,
do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment related activities to
ensure that the EEO policy and the Contractor's obligations under these specifications are being carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xiv) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user toilet
and necessary changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xv) Document and maintain a record of all solicitations of offers for subcontracts from minority and female construction
contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations
and other business associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xvi) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the Contractor's
EEO policies and affirmative action obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Contractors are encouraged to participate in voluntary associations which assist in fulfilling one or more of
their affirmative action obligations (g) (i) through (xvi). The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union,
contractor-community, or other similar group of which the Contractor is a member and participant, may be asserted
as fulfilling any one or more of its obligations under (g) (i) through (xvi) of these specifications provided that
the Contractor actively participates in the group, makes every effort to assure that the group has a positive impact
on the employment of minorities and women in the industry, ensures that the concrete benefits of the program are reflected
in the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation, makes a good faith effort to meet its individual
goals and timetables, and can provide access to documentation which demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken
on behalf of the Contractor. The obligation to comply, however, is the Contractor's and failure of such a group to fulfill
an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's noncompliance.

(i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established. The Contractor, however,
is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both
male and female, and all women, both minority and non-minority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation
of Executive Order 11246 if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner (for example, even
though the Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive
Order 11246 if a specific minority group of women is underutilized). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action standards to discriminate against
any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) The Contractor shall not enter into any Subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts
pursuant to Executive Order 11246. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of these specifications and of the Equal
Opportunity Clause, including suspension, termination and cancellation of existing subcontracts as may be imposed
or ordered pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the Office of Federal
Contract Compliance Programs. Any Contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions and penalties shall be in violation
of these specifications and Executive Order 11246, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The Contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these specifications, shall implement specific affirmative
action steps, at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph (g) of these specifications, so as
to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply
with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, the implementing regulations, or these specifications, the Director
shall proceed in accordance with 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor all employment related activity to ensure that
the company EEO policy is being carried out, to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof as may be required
by the Government and to keep records. Records shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone
numbers, construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification number when assigned, social security
number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status,
hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall
be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy
this requirement, contractors shall not be required to maintain separate records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) Nothing herein provided shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws which establish
different standards of compliance or upon the application of requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents
(e.g. those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).

the Bidder of (a) all documents listed in Article III, section 2, (b) other final documents, and (c) written notification
that all deficiencies listed on the REA Form 517, Results of Acceptance Test, have been corrected; provided, that
the final inspection and tests by the Owner finds the deficiencies satisfactorily resolved. If the deficiencies

are fully and satisfactorily resolved as determined by subsequent Owner's tests. The Certificate of Completion
approved and signed by the Owner and approved in writing by the Administrator shall be conclusive evidence as to the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements the statutory authority of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank) to accept
from non-Federal sources reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred by Eximbank employees in connection
with official travel to a meeting or similar event. Authorized meetings or similar events under this final rule do
not include those described in the Federal Travel Regulations permitting Federal agencies to accept payments from
non-Federal sources for travel expenses. This final rule, by effectuating Eximbank's statutory gift acceptance
authority, will further the mission of Eximbank by enabling Eximbank to issue more official travel orders for employees
to conduct agency business than Eximbank would otherwise be able to issue under its authorized annual travel budget.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2(a)(1) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635(a)), enables Eximbank, subject to
regulations issued pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, to accept reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred
by a director, officer or employee of Eximbank in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States
Code. In order to implement this statutory authority, Eximbank is issuing a regulation that sets forth the parameters
for accepting payment from a non-Federal source for an Eximbank employee's travel and subsistence expenses to attend
or participate in an event relating to the employee's official duties. The regulation applies to events other than
a ``meeting or similar function'' as defined in 41 CFR 304&hyph;1.2(c)(3). The rule enables Eximbank to accept travel
expense payments in order to send employees to such functions as meetings, formal gatherings, site visits, negotiation
sessions and other similar events in which the employee's participation would further the mission of Eximbank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid any actual impropriety or appearance of impropriety in the acceptance of travel expense payments,
the regulation requires that the employee's supervisor and the designated agency ethics official or his/her designee
determine that Eximbank's interest in the employee's attendance at the meeting or similar event outweighs concern
that acceptance of the payment by Eximbank may cause a reasonable person to question the integrity of Eximbank's programs
or operations. As provided in the authorizing statute, the regulation limits payments from a non-Federal source
for travel and subsistence payments to the maximum per diem or actual service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter
301.

Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As General Counsel of Eximbank, I have found good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)(3) for waiving, as unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking and the 30-day delay in effectiveness
as to this final rule. The reason for this determination is that this rulemaking is related to Eximbank organization,
procedure and practice.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As General Counsel of Eximbank, I have determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this
regulation will not have a significant impact on small business entities.

apply because this regulation does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval
of the Office of Management and Budget.

As provided in this part, Eximbank may accept payment from a non-Federal source (or authorize an employee to receive
such payment on its behalf) with respect to attendance of the employee at a meeting or similar event which the employee
has been authorized to attend in an official capacity on behalf of Eximbank. The employee's immediate supervisor
and Eximbank's designated agency ethics official or his/her designee (DAEO) must approve any offer and acceptance
of payment under this part in accordance with the procedures described below. If the employee is a member of Eximbank's
Board of Directors, only the DAEO's approval is required. Any employee authorized to travel in accordance with this
part is subject to the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation class of service limitations
prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Eximbank may accept payment for employee travel from a non-Federal source when a written authorization to accept
payment is issued in advance of the travel following a determination by the employee's supervisor (except in the case
of Board members) and the DAEO that the payment is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For travel relating to an employee's official duties under an official travel authorization issued to the employee;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For attendance at a meeting or similar event as defined in &sect;412.3(c)(3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In which the employee's participation is necessary in order to further the mission of Eximbank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Which cannot be held at the offices of Eximbank for justifiable business reasons in light of the location and number
of participants and the purpose of the meeting or similar event; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Which is taking place at a location and for a period of time that is appropriate for the purpose of the meeting or
similar event; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) From a non-Federal source that is not a conflicting non-Federal source or from a conflicting non-Federal source
that has been approved under &sect;412.9; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In an amount which does not exceed the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation
class of service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An employee requesting approval of payment of travel expenses by a non-Federal source under this part shall submit
to the employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO a written description of the following:
the nature of the meeting or similar event and the reason that it cannot be held at Eximbank, the date(s) and location
of the meeting or similar event, the identities of all participants in the meeting or similar event, the name of the
non-Federal source offering to make the payment, the amount and method of the proposed payment, and the nature of the
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eximbank may accept payment from a conflicting non-Federal source if the conditions of &sect;412.7 are met and the
employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO determine that Eximbank's interest in the
employee's attendance at or participation in the meeting or similar event outweighs concern that acceptance of the
payment by Eximbank may cause a reasonable person to question the integrity of Eximbank's programs and operations.
In determining whether to accept payment, Eximbank shall consider all relevant factors, including the purpose of
the meeting or similar event, the importance of the travel for Eximbank, the nature and sensitivity of any pending
matter affecting the interests of the conflicting non-Federal source, the significance of the employee's role in
any such matter, the identity of other expected participants, and the location and duration of the meeting or similar
event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If Eximbank determines in advance of the travel that a payment covers some but not all of the per diem costs to be incurred

by an employee to attend a meeting or similar function described in and authorized by 41 CFR part 304&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations for delegations of authority relating to general
redelegations of authority from the Associate Commissioner of Regulatory Affairs to certain FDA officials in the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The redelegation provides these officials with authority to
grant or deny certain citizen petitions for exemption or variance from medical device tracking requirements. This
action is being taken to facilitate expeditious handling of citizen petitions. FDA is also issuing a conforming amendment
to the medical device tracking regulations to make the regulations consistent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule revises certain provisions in HUD regulations covering multifamily mortgage insurance which have the
effect of requiring prior HUD endorsement before the expenditure of any fire and hazard insurance loss proceeds by
mortgagees. Instead of this requirement the regulations would be revised to allow loss proceeds to be expended to
restore or repair the property without prior HUD approval. The proceeds may not however, be used for any other purposes
without prior HUD approval.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under existing HUD regulations (24 CFR 207.260) in the event a loss occurs to the mortgaged property under any policy
of fire or other hazard insurance and the mortgagee has received the proceeds therefrom, it shall not exercise its
option under the mortgage to use the proceeds of the insurance for the repairing, replacing, or rebuilding of the premises,
or apply them to the mortgage indebtedness, or make any other disposition of the proceeds without the prior written
approval of the Commissioner. Through cross-referencing this requirement is also made applicable to other FHA multifamily
programs

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule revises current regulatory requirements to provide that the mortgagee may exercise its option to use the
insurance proceeds for the repairing, replacing or rebuilding of the premises without prior HUD approval. It may
not however make any other disposition of insurance proceeds without prior approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has found that its Field Office staff resources can be more effectively allocated to tasks other than
the endorsing of property insurance loss drafts where the proceeds, in any event, are going to be used to restore or
repair the property. We estimate that from $10,000 to $20,000 per year in staff resources could be saved by making this
change. Mortgagees could have similar savings (from reduction of paperwork and check cashing steps) of from $5,000
to $10,000 per year. Project owners also could have savings. Approximately 20,000 project owners, their mortgagees
and their insurance agents and companies should benefit by eliminating this unnecessary procedural step.

The rule also makes conforming revisions to 24 CFR 207.10, 213.13, 221.521 and 242.43 of HUD regulations to provide
that fire and hazard and insurance have attached a standard mortgagee clause making loss payable to the mortgagee,
its successors and assigns rather than the current requirement that loss be payable to the mortgagee and the Commissioner
as their interests may appear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the strictly technical nature of this rule, the Department has determined that the notice and public comment
procedure under Title 5 of the United States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as a final rule.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 515 (the ``Regulations''),
to eliminate the requirement that the arrival and departure of planes providing travel between Cuba and the United
States occur during the normal business hours of the U.S. Customs Service. This change is being effected to allow greater
flexibility in arranging for authorized flights to Cuba. In addition, the Regulations are being amended to add references
to the Cuban Democracy Act, 22 U.S.C. 6001&hyph;6010, and to correct an error in &sect;515.701. Section 515.417 is
removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rule involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

 This rule amends the Libyan Sanctions Regulations to remove from the definition of ``Government of Libya'' a provision
stating that an entity will not be deemed a part of that government solely because it is located in, organized under
the laws of, or has its principal place of business in, Libya, and to make an additional change to the definition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the ``Regulations''), to remove paragraph (b)
from &sect; 550.304, the definition of the term ``Government of Libya.'' Paragraph (b) of &sect;550.304 provided
that a partnership, association, corporation, or other organization shall not be deemed to be within the term ``Government
of Libya'' solely by reason of being located in, organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business
in, Libya. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, former paragraph (a)(2) is revised to remove the word ``substantially,'' which was used to describe
the extent of Libyan government control of an entity required to qualify that entity as a part of the Government of Libya,
and to add the words ``directly or indirectly'' to describe the nature of the governmental control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Corps is revoking the regulations in 33 CFR 209.135 and 209.147. The regulations in &sect;209.135 prohibit structures
within shipping safety fairways in the Gulf of Mexico and prescribe certain conditions for nationwide permits issued
by the Corps for temporary anchors and chains for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs. Similar rules were promulgated
in 33 CFR 322.5 and through an oversight, the rules of Section 209.135 were not revoked at that time. Section 209.147
which establish the Guidelines for the Industry Capability Program is no longer needed and these guidelines are removed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Corps published rules pertaining to shipping safety fairways in 33 CFR 322.5(1) on November 13, 1986, (51 FR 41206&hyph;41260)
to consolidate all permit matters under the same section. These rules replaced the rules in 33 CFR 209.135 and the Corps
intended to subsequently revoke the rules in &sect;209.135. The rules in &sect;209.135 are duplicative and unnecessary.
Pursuant to its general authorities to operate and maintain Federal navigation projects, the Corps conducted a study
to determine the capability of the dredging industry to accomplish the Government's dredging work at reasonable
costs and in a timely manner. The Guidelines in 33 CFR 209.147 provided uniform procedures to evaluate Corps/Industry
roles over a four-year period. That study has been completed and accordingly, these Guidelines are no longer needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corps has determined that notice of proposed rulemaking and public procedures thereto are unnecessary and impractical
in this instance since this action will only remove obsolete materials from the CFR.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), it is certified that the removal
of these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The removal
of these two regulations will not have any effect on the public, any private enterprise or any Government agency. This
action will result in the removal of two obsolete regulations from the CFR.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes procedures for nominating, evaluating, and designating significant caves on lands
administered as part of the National Forest System. The rule also establishes procedures for releasing information
about the location of caves and establishes general prohibitions to protect cave resources from abuse and degradation.
The intended effect is to fully implement the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 on National Forest System
lands and to ensure that National Forest System lands are managed in a manner to protect and maintain, to the extent
practicable, significant caves. These regulations have been developed in close consultation with the Department
of the Interior to ensure uniformity and consistency in approach to the extent that statutory authority permits.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4301&hyph;4309; 102 Stat. 4546), hereafter referred
to as the ``Act'', seeks to secure, protect, and preserve significant caves on Federal lands for the perpetual use,
enjoyment, and benefit of all people. The Act also seeks to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information
between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, educational,
or recreational purposes. The Act requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue such regulations as he deems necessary
to achieve the purposes of the Act on National Forest System lands. The regulations are required to include, but need
not be limited to, criteria for the identification of significant caves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 3, 1989, the Forest Service published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting comments on what should be included in a proposed rule, and particularly requesting suggestions as to criteria
for identifying a significant cave. A total of nine comments were received in response to that notice: 4 from agencies
of State government, 2 from business entities, 2 from individuals, and 1 from a Federal agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on December 23, 1991 (56 FR 66388). The proposed rule described the process
the Forest Service would use in designating significant caves, provided for public nomination of caves, specified
six criteria by which a cave would be evaluated to determine whether it is significant, and identified the authorized
officer as the authority for designating and documenting a significant cave. The proposed rule also specified how
cave information and locations would be released. Lastly, the proposed rule revised certain prohibitions specific
to caves and cave resources. Seventy-six letters were received during the 90-day comment period in response to the
proposed rule: 30 from individuals, 18 from cave-related organizations, 16 from Federal agencies, 5 from natural
resource organizations, 4 from business entities, and 3 from State agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received are available for review in the Office of the Director, Recreation, Cultural Resources, and
Wilderness Management Staff, Auditors Building, 4th Floor, 201 14th Street, S.W. at Independence Ave., SW., Washington,
DC, during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Monday through Friday.

Analysis of Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall, almost all respondents were pleased that the Forest Service was promulgating regulations. Many offered
valuable suggestions for improving or clarifying specific sections. Some of these suggestions were group efforts,
using similar or identical language to identify and describe their interests, concerns, and recommended modifications
to the proposed rule. A few letters endorsed other respondents' statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of comments centered on four major issues in the proposed 261 and 290 rules: scope of the rule, including
the definition and manner of determining the significance of a cave; confidentiality of cave information; public
participation; and differences with the proposed rule (57 FR 1344) published by Department of the Interior on January
13, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments also referred to information contained in a document entitled ``Proposed Procedure for Listing
Significant Caves,'' which was circulated at the same time as the proposed rule but was not intended for codification
in the regulations. This document described a proposed implementation process in greater detail. These comments
also were considered as part of the rulemaking record to the extent that they were relevant to the provisions of the
rulemaking.

General Comments on 36 CFR Part 290
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, cave protection regulations would be set out in title 36, part 290, of the Code of Federal Regulations.
The following summarizes general comments received on the proposed rule and the Department's response to them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Cooperation and Consultation With the Department of Interior
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents noted disparities between the Forest Service proposed rule and the proposed rule issued at the same
time by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI). Most respondents recommended that the final rule of both agencies
be as similar as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout the rulemaking process, the Forest Service and USDI land managing agencies have been participating in
an interagency committee to agree on cave resource standards and procedures. The goal has been to adopt rules as similar
as possible. However, each agency has a different statutory background and mission which result in some procedural
differences such as in integrating cave resource protection into planning processes, delegations of authority,
and information requirements. In these instances, the language may differ to reflect the specific authorities of
the agencies involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Public Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of respondents felt the proposed rule completely ignored Section 2(b)(2) of the Act which states that
one purpose of the Act is ``to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities
and those who utilize caves for scientific, education, or recreational purposes.'' Respondents believed the proposed
rule denied the caving community access to cave information thus discouraging the exchange of information. Many
respondents recommended that public interaction occur through establishment of an advisory committee and the development
of volunteer agreements. Some respondents felt that these two actions were required by the Act in Sections 4(b)(3)
and 4(b)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under &sect;290.3 of the proposed rule, the agency intended that the public be given the opportunity to nominate significant
caves. Additionally, proposed &sect;290.4 provided a process by which information on caves and their location could
be disclosed to bona fide educational or research organizations although not to the general cave recreationing community.
Additionally, under the proposed rule, the agency envisioned addressing cave resource protection standards in
forest plans pursuant to National Forest Management Act and implementing regulations. Forest plans are developed
with full public participation; however, in response to comments on the proposed rule, the final rule does strengthen
and encourage greater cooperation and exchange of information in the nomination and evaluation process as well as
in a new provision permitting the disclosure of cave information to groups who assist the Federal land managing agencies
with cave management. These changes are discussed in the section-by-section discussion of comments which follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestion to form an advisory committee has not been adopted. It is not at all clear that such advisory groups are
needed either nationally or locally. Whether local advisory groups are needed is a decision best left to the local
land manager. Should the Forest Supervisor determine that an advisory committee would be helpful in achieving the
purposes of the Cave Resources Protection Act, the Department has ample authority and procedures in place to establish
such advisory committees.

3. Scope and Detail of the Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents felt that the proposed rule should have provided more details on how to manage and protect significant
caves. Most of these respondents understood that significant caves would be managed ``to the extent practical''
using current management plans, but wanted the final rule to incorporate or further clarify portions of the proposed
rule. Respondents asked questions such as: how will significant cave listings and significant cave management concerns
be integrated into forest plans; how will specific management concerns about significant caves be identified; how
will ecosystem considerations, including protection of karst features and hydrological recharge areas, be made;
and how will the Forest Service address proposed projects that potentially impact caves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another respondent requested that goals and standards for cave resource protection and management be described
in the rule and that language be added emphasizing that land management decisions should balance consideration of
cave resource protection with consideration of human activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through section 4(c)(1) of the Act, Congress made clear that caves should be managed through the agency's land and
resource management planning process, and not through the significant cave designation process. Section 4(c)(1)
states that significant caves are to be ``.&blank;.&blank;. considered in the preparation of any land management
plan if the preparation or revision of the plan began after the enactment of this Act.'' Forest land and resource management
planning is a continuous, dynamic process which is dependent on monitoring and evaluation of actions taken under
the plan. The agency keeps plans current and updated through amendment or revision and maintains ongoing and meaningful
communication with the public and other government entities. New data such as an inventory of significant caves is
new information that Forest Supervisors consider as forest plans are implemented to determine if forest plan direction
needs to be changed. Designating caves as significant will not automatically trigger the need to amend or revise forest
plans. Upon development of the initial listing of significant caves on National Forest System lands, the Forest Supervisor
will review the forest plan and determine if it is adequate to ensure protection of significant cave resources. If
not, the Supervisor would initiate amendment or revision of the plan to address the protection of significant cave
resources on the forest. The public must be involved in amendment or revision. Thus, any special management concerns
for significant caves, including connected ecosystem considerations, can and should be identified by the public
so that the comments can be analyzed and considered through the forest planning process. The forest planning process
is already adequately regulated by the provisions of 36 CFR part 219; therefore, no additional change to this rule
was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a proposed project might impact a significant cave or cave yet to be evaluated for significance, the effects
of the project would be analyzed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations.
Public input is solicited to identify environmental issues relevant to a proposed action (project).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency policy and procedures under the NEPA in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 require that decision documents (Decision
Memo, Decision Notice, Record of Decision) contain ``Findings required by other laws.'' If a decision affects a significant
cave, a finding will be disclosed describing how the decision considered this cave.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 290.1&blank;Purpose and Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering the general comments on the scope and detail of the regulations addressed in the preceding section
of this preamble, the Department concludes that the proposed rule was confusing in specifying that the initial determination
of significant caves would be made by a special process and that subsequent significant cave determinations would
be made through the forest plan amendment or revision process. The final rule clarifies this concern by: (1) stating
that significant cave resources will be managed pursuant to direction contained in individual forest plans and in
accordance with the policies contained in the Forest Service Directive System and (2) by eliminating any reference
to forest planning in the initial and subsequent listings. This change acknowledges that forest plans provide direction
to manage significant caves but do not contain a list of these caves.

Authorized Officer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents expressed concern over the range of potentially designated authorized officers listed in the
proposed rule. One respondent felt that the authorizing officer should be the Regional Forester while another felt
this authority should not be delegated below the Forest Supervisor level. Another felt the final decision for determining
significant caves should be at a senior management level. Further, some respondents indicated that the authorized
officer should have qualifications and duties related to caves and/or cave resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received on this definition reflect a lack of understanding of how authority is delegated through the
Forest Service. Authority flows from the Chief through Regional Foresters to Forest Supervisors and District Rangers.
These line officers have responsibility for managing all resources, including caves, and will be legally responsible
for complying with this rule and the Act. The agency will delegate that responsibility through the issuance of internal
agency directives and the delegation of authority will vary depending on the significance of the action being assigned.
In general, the authorized officer will refer to the Forest Supervisor who must carry out the evaluations and documentations
required by the rule in the context of forest planning. To avoid confusion, the definition in the final rule does not
include the list of all potential authorized officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Cave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency received a range of opinions on this definition. Some respondents felt the definition was too narrow; others
believed it was too broad. Some respondents, stating that a vug is one resource the Act is intended to protect, were
concerned with the exclusion of vugs from the definition. Individual respondents suggested modifying the definition
to include qualifiers such as: a dark zone; a minimum horizontal or vertical length; absence or presence of an entrance
at any specific time period, and a naturally formed subterranean open area. A couple of respondents were concerned
about the requirement that an individual be able to enter. One felt this precluded passages accessible for small cave
biota. Another felt this requirement may allow for enlarging small openings to make them accessible as caves. One
respondent was concerned that the definition would not protect the ``unnatural'' portion of caves from destruction
or restrict the location of such from the general public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has concluded that the definition in the proposed rule was confusing because it described both the
components of a cave and the features that do not comprise a cave. Accordingly, in the final rule, this definition has
been revised to focus on what a cave is, rather than what it is not. ``Feature'' was replaced with ``opening'' since
it was felt the intent is to include small air passages that extend from the cave itself and that are integral parts of
the cave. This definition encompasses any entranceways, including excavated passage; therefore, the location
and passage associated with the excavated portion is considered under purposes of this Act. While the suggested qualifiers
further define features associated with caves, they were not added because they extend beyond the scope of the cave
definition listed in the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Cave Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some respondents suggested that historical resources be separated from the rest of the resources listed as naturally
occurring. A few respondents noted that speleogens and speleothems should be defined since these terms are not commonly
found in dictionaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``naturally'' was removed as suggested since cultural materials do not occur naturally in caves. Speleogens
and speleothems are not included in the definition in the final rule since they are but a couple of the features that
comprise geologic and mineralogic materials or substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
National Forest System Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents were confused over which lands the Act applied to: non-federal lands on which the agency has planned
projects, private lands with caves affected by agency projects on Federal lands, lands owned in fee title, and/or
National Forest System lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A definition for ``National Forest System lands'' has been added. This rule applies only to lands managed by and under
the legal jurisdiction of the Forest Service. The Act contains no language extending agency authority to private
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Significant Cave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents noted that this definition should correspond to the criteria listed in proposed section 290.3(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition was revised to include the criteria now in &sect;290.3 (c) and (d).

Vug
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents overlapped their comments on ``vug'' with the ``cave'' definition. A couple of respondents suggested
clarifications to the definition including: Add a size definition other than ``small'' and make clear that a vug is
only a stand-alone cavity presumable intersected by a man-made passage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the only reference to a vug was in the definition of a cave and this reference has now been removed, the separate
definition of a vug is no longer necessary.

Paragraph (a) Nominations for Initial and Subsequent Listings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) provided that the Secretary of Agriculture shall cooperate and consult with the Secretary
of Interior to devise a similar nomination process for initial listing of significant caves and give public notice
of the nomination process. In addition, subsequent determinations of significant caves would be made through the
forest planning process. Many respondents felt that the review of nominations and the determination by the authorized
officer should be conducted in consultation and cooperation with an advisory committee, team, acknowledged experts
in the field of speleology, or appropriate private sector interests, including cavers. A few respondents felt an
appeal process was needed for those caves determined not to be significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph was revised to focus more narrowly on the nomination process, and a new paragraph (b) was added to describe
the evaluation process. The reference in the proposed rule to subsequent determination of significant caves through
the forest planning process has been removed. Determination of significant caves can be made at any time by the authorized
officer. Reference to consultation between the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior was removed since this coordination
has occurred in the writing of the entire rule and through a separate effort to develop a Proposed Procedure for Listing
Significant Caves. Both paragraphs emphasize public and agency input and consultation. Notice of the nomination
procedures for the initial listing must be published in the

. Notice of future listings is not required as the rule provides that the public and government agencies are to submit

Paragraph (c) Criteria for Significant Caves
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many respondents stated that the criteria were too broad; others felt the criteria were too restrictive. Those respondents
who felt the criteria are too broad suggested that criteria be developed at the State-level, be eliminated, or be modified
with a strong emphasis on the cave having an important value. The majority of respondents felt that these criteria
would eliminate the majority of caves from listing as significant. Most requested that criteria be based only on a
cave processing ``one or more of the following features, characteristics, or values.'' Some recommended that the
criteria focus on identifying insignificant caves; thus, managing all others as significant. Individual respondents
identified the need to add new criteria categories for caves of undetermined status, caves with abnormal dangers,
caves with other values, and caves within a special management area which was designated wholly or in part due to the
cave resources found there.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, two business entities felt that the criteria for selection of significant caves are too broad and that
the proposed rule neglected to consider the impacts that such a designation would have on oil and gas production. They
felt that the designation of significant caves needed to be based on caves having an ``important value'', especially
when considering other uses of the land. They recommended that significant cave values be weighed against the economic
values of mineral development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act in section 4(a) requires that the Secretary issue criteria for the identification of significant caves in
regulations. Thus, criteria focusing on insignificant caves or criteria developed at the State level do not address
the Act's mandate. To focus the criteria on an inventory procedure that can be interpreted and more consistently applied
across the agency, the qualifier ``*&blank;*&blank;* which are deemed by the authorized officer to be unusual, significant,
or otherwise meriting special management'' has not been adopted on the final rule. This phrase confused respondents
since it added another level of evaluation and review to the six stated criteria. There is nothing in the Act or its legislative
history that indicates that a cave has to have a value more important than, or be weighed against, other uses of public
lands before being designated significant. The criteria for designating significant caves are identical to those
adopted in the Department of the Interior's final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Biota.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All respondents commenting on this paragraph requested modifications to make the criteria less restrictive. They
recommended the removal of qualifiers such as ``cave dependent,'' ``that occur in large numbers or variety,'' and
``disturbance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Cave dependent'' was replaced with ``seasonal or yearlong'' to better describe the conditions under which biota
use a cave. The qualifier ``*&blank;*&blank;* occur in large numbers or variety *&blank;*&blank;*'' was removed
because caves typically contain small populations and variety of flora and fauna by the very nature of the cave environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cultural.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All respondents commenting on this paragraph felt the criterion was too restrictive to include potentially eligible
sites, religious sites for native Americans, caves mined for saltpeter, and sites with ethnographic or historic
associations with events or persons considered important to local communities or social groups. A few suggested
eliminating the requirement that the site be eligible for or listed on the National Register or Historic Places.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph was clarified to address and refer to the terms ``historic or prehistoric'' that are already defined
through other laws and regulations. These terms encompass ``cultural'' resources better than historical properties
and archaeological resources. The paragraph also was expanded to better describe the types of resources that could
be included or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places based on the cave itself or the contents
contained within. The paragraph as revised encompasses religious sites for native Americans, caves mined for saltpeter,
and other sites with ethnographic or historic associations. Allowing for a site to be eligible for or listed on the
National Register of Historic Places consistently ties to the agency management of cultural resources.

Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents felt that the terms ``outstanding'' and ``important'' were too restrictive. Most recommended that
``outstanding'' be replaced with ``other interesting'' or that it and ``important'' be deleted completely. Several
respondents felt these criteria would allow every cave to be determined significant. One recommended that this paragraph
be completely eliminated; another recommended tying the criteria to only ``fragile or outstanding'' examples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule the qualifiers ``outstanding'', ``useful'' and ``important'' have been eliminated and replaced
with more tangible terms. However, while some restrictive qualifiers have been expanded, there are still qualifiers
that could appropriately eliminate caves from listing under this criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrologic. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent felt this criterion should be limited to waters that are necessary to maintain municipal water supplies
and maintain scientifically important biota or cave features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department disagrees. This criterion is adopted without change from the proposed rule since it addresses hydrological
resources associated with caves and cave resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recreational. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most respondents requested that ``challenge'' be replaced and values such as wilderness, sporting, natural, aesthetic,
exploration, educational, and scientific be substituted. One respondent felt that this section should be completely
removed. Another noted that scenic values and challenge must have an important value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion responds to the Act which recognizes caves for their perpetual use, enjoyment, and benefit for all
people and further notes that people utilize caves for recreational purposes. The qualifier ``by virtue of challenge''
has been eliminated since it does not describe a type of recreational opportunity that can be measured. In the final
rule, this paragraph is written broadly enough to incorporate the suggested values of wilderness, sporting, aesthetic,
and exploration if they tie to recreational and scenic opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational or scientific. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent noted that any new cave discoveries would automatically qualify as significant under this proposed
criterion. Several other respondents felt that qualifiers should be deleted to make the criteria less restrictive.
One suggested adding wilderness and uniqueness to this category. Other felt that these criteria must either note
an important value or it should be removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to this paragraph in the final rule are minor. ``Contemporary'' is inserted before ``human disturbance''
to ensure that cultural resources are considered rather than recent acts of vandalism. New cave discoveries could
be designated significant if they lack evidence of contemporary human disturbance or impact. This acknowledges
that a pristine cave offers potential values from a scientific, educational, and recreational standpoint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specially designated areas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has been added to recognize that some management decisions have already been made wholly or in part due to caves. Where
special management designations are already associated with protecting caves, it is efficient to designate them
as significant without re-evaluating them under the requirements of paragraph (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e) Designation and Documentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several respondents felt clarification was needed for the authorized officer's designation of significant caves.
They felt that designation should be tied to the authorized officer confirming that a cave met one of the criteria rather
than evaluating the criteria itself. Another respondent requested that the rule be specific as to what information
must be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wording of this paragraph in the final rule clarifies that the authorized officer will confirm whether or not a
cave meets one of the criteria listed in &sect;290.3(c). This clearly defines the role of authorized officer as a decisionmaker
not a reviewer of the criteria. The paragraph also specifies the minimum documentation to be retained for each cave
designated as significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (f), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Undiscovered passages,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been added to clearly recognize that once a cave has been listed, the designation applies to the entire cave on federal
land, regardless of agency jurisdiction or extent of exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A decision to place a cave on the significant cave list is an inventory type decision, and as such, is not appropriately
subject to administrative appeal. Accordingly, new paragraph (g), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Decision final
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has been added to clearly state that this determination is not subject to appeal. However, paragraph (a) of this section
of the final rule contains a new sentence that makes explicit that a nomination may be resubmitted for listing, thus
acknowledging that a decision not to list a cave may be changed when better or new information accompanies the nomination.

Section 290.4&blank;Confidentiality of Cave Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of respondents focused on three concerns:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the confidentiality language of the proposed rule went beyond the intent of the Act. They specifically noted
that the provisions were to apply only to cave locations, not other cave information. Further, they felt that these
provisions would inhibit exchange of information between the caving community and the Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That caves not designated significant have their locations protected under confidentiality provisions. Otherwise,
all information about that cave would become public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That denial of cave location information be subject to appeal. A couple of respondents noted that the requirements
for requesting information differed between the FS proposed rule and the USDI proposed rule. Two others expressed
the concern that without knowing the exact location of a cave, it is impossible for a mineral lessee to know whether
the cave will affect his lease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) has been revised to indicate that only location information will be held confidential, but other specific
information could be withheld if, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it would reveal the location of a cave.
Locational information for all caves will be protected until the designation decision is made. This protection will
continue for caves listed as significant. The information submitted for caves that are not listed will be returned
to the person or organization submitting the nomination. Consequently, the responsibility for maintaining the
confidentiality of unlisted caves will rest with the originator of the information and not with the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of this section has procedures to request confidential information, and has been rewritten to be identical
to the language adopted by the USDI in its final rule for uniformity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c), which states the decision regarding access to information is not appealable, has been retained. The
Act provides specific exemption from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. It is the Department's determination
that the appeal process would not further public interest in protecting cave information. A procedure exists to permit
the release of cave locations. The authorized officer will release cave location information based on a written request
and a determination that the request would further the purposes of the Act and would not create a substantial risk of
harm, theft, or destruction of such cave.

Implementation of Proposed Prohibitions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent was confused by the prohibitions. Concern was expressed that some additional action must occur for
the prohibition to take effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prohibitions applying to National Forest System lands are separated into three Subparts: General Prohibitions;
Prohibitions in Areas Designated by Order; and Prohibitions in Regions. General Prohibitions are enforced on all
National Forest System lands and do not require any formal posting. Prohibitions in Areas Designated by Order require
an additional action to inform a forest visitor. The order must be posted in accordance with 261.51 of this chapter.

8 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of the current rulemaking was to establish the criteria for significant caves. Where it was expedient
to make minor adjustments to existing prohibitions in order to help protect significant cave resources, this was
also done. If experience with administering significant cave resources shows additional regulations and penalties
are needed, subsequent rulemaking specific to those management concerns will be undertaken.

Respondents were concerned that this prohibition would not allow a gate to be installed if it was needed to protect
a species, including those listed as threatened or endangered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paragraph was modified to address this concern by adding ``.&blank;.&blank;. except as authorized to protect
a cave resource.'' A gate was not specifically cited since there may be other types of installations that could curtail
the movement of cave life to protect a cave resource.

Section 261.9(j)&blank;Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents were confused by the intent of this paragraph. One asked whether enlarging a naturally occurring
cave passage or entrance would require a special use authorization. Another requested clarification stating that
a special use authorization cannot permit damage to, or excavation of, a significant cave. One respondent suggested
adding a new prohibition to address section 7(a)(2) of the Act dealing with possessing, consuming, selling, bartering,
or exchanging any cave resource without authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(1) of the Act states that activities that may lead to destroying altering, or removing of cave resources
or interfering with free movement of plant or animal life may only be permitted with prior authorization. Thus, any
excavation of a cave passage or entrance would have to be approved by a special use authorization. A special use authorization
permitting excavation in a cave is site-specific, thus, this provision does not encourage nor allow blanket approval
for this type of activity for all caves on a given forest. A clause has been added prohibiting the removal of any cave
resource for commercial purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed wording has been retained. The cave entrance area is protected by the existing wording in paragraphs
(d)(1) and (d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (n) was added to specifically address the discharge of fireworks. No existing prohibition addressed
this human safety concern.

Section 261.58(ee)&blank;Occupancy and Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most respondents requested that ``litter'' be incorporated into this clause. A couple of respondents felt that additional
wording was needed to allow cavers to bring and remove their own receptacles. Another respondent recommended that
fluid wastes be considered on a cave by cave basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 11(b) of this section already prohibits ``Possessing or leaving .&blank;.&blank;. litter in an exposed
or unsanitary condition.'' Current wording does not specify who must provide the receptacles; therefore, it can
be interpreted that cavers may bring in and remove their own receptacles. Since this prohibition is applicable to
a specific area designated through an order by the Forest Supervisor, there is the flexibility to add an exception
for a particular cave to only prohibit solid wastes.

Regulatory Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
nor State or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise
new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this final rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), and
it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as defined by that Act. To the extent that small entities engaged in resource extraction activities may have
to site operations to protect significant caves, these requirements are the minimum necessary to protect the public
interest, and are well within the capability of small entities to perform.

of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest Service received approval from the Office of Management and Budget to collect
cave nomination information and confidential cave information. The agency estimates that each person will spend
an average of three hours per response for a cave nomination and one-half hour per response for the confidential cave
information request.

The rules of this part implement the requirements of the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 4301&hyph;4309),
hereafter referred to as the ``Act''. The rules apply to cave management on National Forest System lands. These rules,
in conjunction with rules in part 261 of this chapter, provide the basis for identifying and managing significant
caves on National Forest System lands in accordance with the Act. National Forest System lands will be managed in a
manner which, to the extent practical, protects and maintains significant cave resources in accordance with the
policies outlined in the Forest Service Directive System and the management direction contained in the individual
forest plans.

Act of 1980 as amended (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest Service has received approval by the Office of Management and Budget
to collect cave nomination information under clearance number 0596&hyph;0123 and confidential information under
0596&hyph;0122. The information provided for the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be listed
as ``significant'' and the information in the requests to obtain confidential cave information will be used to decide
whether to grant access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is voluntary. No action may
be taken against a person for refusing to supply the information requested. Response to the information requirements
for obtaining confidential cave information is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with section 5 of the Federal
Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4304).

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends Postal Service regulations on forfeiture procedures by removing the provision requiring
the agency to provide a receipt of the inventory of the property seized for forfeiture to the party whose property was
seized within 10 days of the seizure. This amendment is intended to make the inventory notice precedure of the Postal
Service consistent with other federal agencies and to eliminate an unnecessary burden on the agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Postal Service regulations concerning inventory procedures for property seized for forfeiture are published in
title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as &sect;233.7(c). The last sentence of that section establishes
a 10-day maximum period for the agency to give a written receipt of the inventory of the property seized for forfeiture
and the identity of the Postal Inspector who conducted the seizure to the party from whom the property was seized. Section
233.7(c) is amended to remove the 10-day limit to make the inventory notice procedure of the Postal Service consistent
with other federal agencies and to eliminate an unnecessary burden on the agency when the party whose property was
seized cannot be readily identified.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63316), EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maine. The NPR proposed approval of several regulations adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State of Maine which require the implementation of RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various types of VOC sources. No public comments were received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, ozone nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were required to adopt RACT rules for sources of VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued three sets of control technique guidelines (CTGs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents, establishing a ``presumptive norm'' for RACT for various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of VOC sources. The three sets of CTGs were: (1) Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I_issued before January 1978 (15 CTGs); (2) Group II_issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1978 (9 CTGs); and (3) Group III_issued in the early 1980's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 CTGs). Those sources not covered by a CTG were called non-CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. EPA determined that the area's SIP-approved attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date established which RACT rules the area needed to adopt and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement. Under section 172(a)(1), ozone nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were generally required to attain the ozone standard by December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31, 1982. Those areas that submitted an attainment demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projecting attainment by that date were required to adopt RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources covered by the Group I and II CTGs. Those areas that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sought an extension of the attainment date under section 172(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to as late as December 31, 1987 were required to adopt RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all CTG sources and for all major (i.e., 100 ton per year or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of VOC emissions) non-CTG sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, Maine was designated as rural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment and, therefore, was required to adopt regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the Group I and Group II CTGs for major sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on monitored ozone exceedances in Maine, EPA notified the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governor of Maine on May 25, 1988 and November 8, 1988 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the 1977 CAA were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended Section 182(a)(2)(A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that pre-enactment ozone nonattainment areas that retained
their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of nonattainment and were classified as marginal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above fix their deficient RACT rules for ozone by May 15, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the amended CAA, two counties in Maine were classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as marginal (these two counties constitute one marginal ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment area) and seven counties in Maine were classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate (these seven counties constitute three moderate ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment areas). 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991). The State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted revisions to meet the RACT fix-up requirement and EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved these revisions to the Maine SIP on February 3, 1992 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 22, 1993 (57 FR 3946 and 58 FR 15281).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(b)(2) of the amended Act requires States to adopt RACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for all areas designated nonattainment for ozone and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as moderate or above. There are three parts to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 182(b)(2) RACT requirement: (1) RACT for sources covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an existing CTG_i.e., a CTG issued prior to the enactment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAAA of 1990; (2) RACT for sources covered by a post-enactment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CTG; and (3) all major sources not covered by a CTG, i.e., non-CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. This RACT requirement which applies to nonattainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas that previously were exempt from certain RACT requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires areas to ``catch up'' to those nonattainment areas that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
became subject to those requirements during an earlier period. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, it requires newly designated ozone nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adopt RACT rules consistent with those for previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated nonattainment areas. As previously mentioned, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State of Maine contains three moderate ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These areas are thus subject to the section 182(b)(2) RACT catch-up requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the State of Maine is located in the Northeast Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Region (OTR). The entire State is, therefore, subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 184(b) of the amended CAA. Section 184(b) requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that RACT be implemented for all VOC sources covered by a CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued before or after the enactment of the CAAA of 1990 and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all major VOC sources (defined as 50 tons per year or greater for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources in the OTR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Maine had previously submitted regulations for bulk gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals, fixed roof petroleum tanks, and paper coating sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the RACT fix-up requirement, in order to meet the RACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catch-up requirement, the State must, therefore, adopt regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or affirm that no sources exist) for the remaining 26 CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories as well as adopt rules for all major non-CTG sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Rules for non-CTG sources are not part of this SIP revision and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be further discussed in this document).

In response to the RACT catch-up requirement, on May 14, 1992 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 12, 1992, Maine submitted negative declarations for the CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Surface coating of coils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Large petroleum dry cleaners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through the negative declaration, the State of Maine is asserting that there are no sources within the State that would
be subject to a rule for that source category. EPA is approving this negative declaration submittal as meeting the
section 182(b)(2) and section 184(b) RACT requirements for the source categories listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After submitting the above negative declarations, Maine then proceeded with the process of adopting regulations
to control the remaining CTG categories which include surface coating processes, solvent metal cleaning, graphic
arts operations, the use of cutback asphalt, and gasoline marketing operations. Maine's gasoline marketing RACT
catch-up regulations are not a part of this SIP revision, and will not be further discussed in this notice.

Chapter 129: Surface Coating Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation contains requirements for limiting the VOC emissions from the surface coating of cans, fabric, vinyl,
metal furniture, flatwood paneling, and miscellaneous metal parts and products. Surface coating facilities may

EPA has evaluated Maine's VOC regulations and has found that they are consistent with EPA model regulations and the
applicable CTG documents. As such, EPA believes that the submitted rules constitute RACT for the applicable sources.
By this action, EPA is approving Maine's submittal as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(2) and 184(b)(1)(B)
for the applicable VOC sources. Maine's regulations and EPA's evaluation are detailed in a memorandum, dated July
16, 1993, entitled ``Technical Support Document_Maine_VOC RACT Catch-ups.'' Copies of that document are available,
upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving Maine's Chapter 100 ``Definitions Regulation,'' Chapter 129 ``Surface Coating Facilities,''
Chapter 130 ``Solvent Degreasers,'' Chapter 131 ``Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt,'' and Chapter 132 ``Graphic
Arts-Rotogravure and Flexography'' as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(2) and 184(b) of the CAA for the
following categories of VOC sources: the surface coating of cans, fabric, vinyl, metal furniture, flatwood paneling,
and miscellaneous metal parts and products; solvent metal cleaning; the use of cutback asphalt; and rotogravure
and flexographic printing operations. EPA is also approving the negative declarations submitted by the State of
Maine as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(2) and 184(b) of the CAA for the 15 source categories for which
negative declarations were submitted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result,
the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the procedures published in
the

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which
superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') is today 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publishing an interpretive rule regarding roof removal operations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants for Asbestos (``Asbestos NESHAP''). The purpose of the interpretive rule is to clarify the Asbestos
NESHAP as it affects roof removal operations by: specifying which roof removal operations EPA construes the NESHAP
to cover; and specifying roof removal work practices that EPA deems to be in compliance with the NESHAP in roofing operations
where the NESHAP applies.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 20, 1990, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 48406) revisions to the Asbestos NESHAP, which is codified at 40 CFR part 61, subpart M. Members of the roofing
industry have expressed confusion regarding the asbestos NESHAP and have requested clarification from EPA with
regard to how compliance with the NESHAP can be achieved for roof removal operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today publishing, as a new appendix A to subpart M of 40 CFR part 61, the interpretive rule that is set forth below.
The purpose of the interpretive rule is to clarify the Asbestos NESHAP as it affects roof removal operations by: (i)
Specifying which roof removal operations EPA construes the NESHAP to cover; and (ii) specifying roof removal work
practices that EPA deems to be in compliance with the NESHAP in roofing operations where the NESHAP applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new appendix A to the Asbestos NESHAP does not supersede, alter or replace the Asbestos NESHAP; nor does it change
the scope or stringency of the NESHAP. Rather appendix A interprets the NESHAP as it applies to roof removal operations,
in order to provide particularized guidance which, if followed, would promote compliance with, and more effective
and consistent enforcement of, the NESHAP in such operations. This interpretive rule is intended as guidance to the
roofing industry and the public and does not constitute an action which is subject to judicial review under section
307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), or under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704. In addition,
because the rule prescribed in this notice is an interpretive rule and does not promulgate or revise a standard or regulation
listed in section 307(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)), the procedural requirements for rulemaking
under the Clean Air Act and the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to this action. See 42 U.S.C. 7607(d); 5 U.S.C.
553(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the present intent of EPA that if this interpretive rule is revoked or withdrawn before new regulations regarding
asbestos emissions or work practices for handling of asbestos containing materials during roof removal operations
under the Clean Air Act are promulgated by EPA, then EPA shall replace the interpretive rule with another interpretation
or guidance document that would address how the NESHAP applies to roof removal in renovation and demolition operations.
It is also the present intent of EPA that prior to replacing or substantially revising this interpretive rule, EPA
would consult with the public regarding such action.

I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more than one percent asbestos as determined using
the methods specified in appendix A, subpart F, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy. The NESHAP
classifies ACM as either ``friable'' or ``nonfriable''. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized
or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced
to powder by hand pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II
ACM are distinguished from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing
gaskets, packings, resilient floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing products containing
more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-containing
single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof
coatings and mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products that use other bituminous or
resinous binders (such as coal tars or pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM includes all
other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing
more than one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely to become friable when damaged
than is Category I ACM. The applicability of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of the material
at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3)
the amount of ACM involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is referred to as ``regulated asbestos-containing
material'' (RACM). RACM is defined in &sect;61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable asbestos-containing
material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will
be sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that has already been or is likely to become crumbled,
pulverized, or reduced to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a renovation or demolition
operation, then all friable ACM in the operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, are
subject to the NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family homes or on residential buildings containing four
or fewer dwelling units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the total asbestos-containing
roof area undergoing renovation is less than 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its
condition (friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that
damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating blade
(RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable
asbestos-containing roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of that material will create 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, ``RB roof cutter'' means an engine-powered roof cutting machine
with one or more rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with blades having sharp or tapered
edges, and/or which does not use a rotating blade, is used for ``slicing'' rather than ``cutting'' the roofing material;
such equipment is not included in the term ``RB roof cutter''.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an
RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing
roofing material, any project that is 5580 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or greater is subject to the NESHAP; conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment
that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing
material in a roof removal project that is less than 5580 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the project is not subject to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for demolitions. EPA further
construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on Category
I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the area of roof to be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II roofing material), if the area of the roofing material
to be removed is at least 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the removal methods will crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from other ACM that has
been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or
other Category II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the removal is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, except that notification is always
required for demolitions. 40 CFR 61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing
roofing material as little as possible. If A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without
160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other
ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not subject to the NESHAP, even where
the total area of the roofing material to be removed exceeds 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
; provided, however, that if the renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal operation
is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation activities exceeds 160 ft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore,
to determine if a removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is subject to the NESHAP, any suspect
roofing material (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
roofing material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such roofing material contains more than one
percent asbestos and if the removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified and the work practices
in &sect;61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of
suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for asbestos if the contractor follows the notification
and work practice requirements of the NESHAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. A/C Shingle Removal (Category II ACM Removal) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.B.1. A/C shingles, which are Category II nonfriable ACM, become regulated ACM if the material has a high probability
of becoming or has become crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by the forces expected to act on the material in
the course of demolition or renovation operations. 40 CFR 61.141. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, merely breaking an A/C shingle (or any other category II ACM) that is not friable may not necessarily cause
the material to become RACM. A/C shingles are typically nailed to buildings on which they are attached. EPA believes
that the extent of breakage that will normally result from carefully removing A/C shingles and lowering the shingles
to the ground will not result in crumbling, pulverizing or reducing the shingles to powder. Conversely, the extent
of breakage that will normally occur if the A/C shingles are dropped from a building or scraped off of a building with
heavy machinery would cause the shingles to become RACM. EPA therefore construes the NESHAP to mean that the removal
of A/C shingles that are not friable, using methods that do not crumble, pulverize, or reduce the A/C shingles to powder
(such as pry bars, spud bars and shovels to carefully pry the material), is not subject to the NESHAP provided that the
A/C shingles are properly handled during and after removal, as discussed in this paragraph and the asbestos NESHAP.
This interpretation also applies to other Category II nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Cutting vs. Slicing and Manual Methods for Removal of Category I ACM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1.C.1. Because of damage to the roofing material, and the potential for fiber release, roof removal operations using
rotating blade (RB) roof cutters or other equipment that sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material are subject to
the NESHAP. As EPA interprets the NESHAP, the use of certain manual methods (using equipment such as axes, hatchets,
or knives, spud bars, pry bars, and shovels, but not saws) or methods that slice, shear, or punch (using equipment such
as a power slicer or power plow) does not constitute ``cutting, sanding, grinding or abrading.'' This is because these
methods do not destroy the structural matrix or integrity of the material such that the material is crumbled, pulverized
or reduced to powder. Hence, it is EPA's interpretation that when such methods are used, assuming the roof material
is not friable, the removal operation is not subject to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.C.2. Power removers or power tear-off machines are typically used to pry the roofing material up from the deck after
the roof membrane has been cut. It is EPA's interpretation that when these machines are used to pry roofing material
up, their use is not regulated by the NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.C.3. As noted previously, the NESHAP only applies to the removal of asbestos-containing roofing materials. Thus,
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP does not apply to the use of RB cutters to remove non-asbestos built up roofing (BUR). On roofs containing some

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing and some non-asbestos containing materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under the NESHAP depends on the methods used to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each type of material in addition to other coverage thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified above. For example, it is not uncommon for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roofs to be made of non-asbestos BUR and base flashings that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain asbestos. In that situation, EPA construes the NESHAP to be inapplicable to the removal of the non-asbestos
BUR using an RB cutter so long as the RB cutter is not used to cut 5580 ft2 or more of the asbestos-containing base flashing
or other asbestos-containing material into sections. In addition, the use of methods that slice, shear, punch or
pry could then be used to remove the asbestos flashings and not trigger coverage under the NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. Notification for a demolition is always required under the NESHAP. However, EPA believes that few roof removal
jobs constitute ``demolitions'' as defined in the NESHAP (&sect;61.141). In particular, it is EPA's view that the
removal of roofing systems (i.e., the roof membrane, insulation, surfacing, coatings, flashings, mastic, shingles,
and felt underlayment), when such removal is not a part of a demolition project, constitutes a ``renovation'' under
the NESHAP. If the operation is a renovation, and Category I roofing material is being removed using either manual
methods or slicing, notification is not required by the NESHAP. If Category II material is not friable and will be removed
without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, no notification is required. Also, if the renovation involves
less than the threshold area for applicability as discussed above, then no notification is required. However, if
a roof removal meets the applicability and threshold requirements under the NESHAP, then EPA (or the delegated agency)
must be notified in advance of the removal in accordance with the requirements of &sect;61.145(b), as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Notification must be given in writing at least 10 working days in advance and must include the information in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;61.145(b)(4), except for emergency renovations as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The notice must be updated as necessary, including, for example, when the amount of asbestos-containing roofing
material reported changes by 20 percent or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA must be notified if the start date of the roof removal changes. If the start date of a roof removal project
is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed to an earlier date, EPA must be provided with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written notice of the new start date at least 10 working days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in advance. If the start date changes to a later date, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be notified by telephone as soon as possible before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original start date and a written notice must be sent as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;For emergency renovations (as defined in &sect;61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety
or public health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the notification must be postmarked
or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, but no later than the following work day.

A. Requirements to Adequately Wet and Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No Visible Emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal operations include requirements that the affected
material be adequately wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of properly. The requirements
for disposal of waste materials are discussed separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements
discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section
I above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation (&sect;&sect;61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires
that RACM be adequately wet (as defined in &sect;61.141) during the operation that damages or disturbs the asbestos
material until collected for disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to
remove Category I asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements of &sect;61.145(c)
apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the ``adequately
wet'' and ``discharge no visible emission'' requirements of the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated
with the following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface;
and (2) a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in operation during the
cutting of the roof.

B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may not be required during the cutting of Category
I asbestos roofing material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with &sect;61.145(c)(3)(i),
that wetting will unavoidably damage the building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard
while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, the roof removal operation will be exempted
from the requirement to wet during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to base such a decision.
Before proceeding with a dry removal, the contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions
will be made on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the wetting requirements are not necessary. Where
EPA grants an exemption from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage to equipment within
the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP specifies alternative control methods (&sect;61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)).
Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do
not produce visible emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements
of &sect;61.152, or (c) other methods that have received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative
emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has received written approval from EPA and the
method is being implemented consistent with the approved procedures (&sect;61.145(c)(3)(ii) or &sect;61.152(b)(3)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is
below freezing, as specified in &sect;61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated as the reason for not
wetting, records must be kept of the temperature at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not performed
and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 years. 42 CFR &sect;61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation
that in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the Administrator is needed for using emission
control methods listed in &sect;61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that have been previously
approved by the Administrator. However, such written application or approval is required for alternative emission
control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and debris collected from cutting must still be kept
wet and placed in containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste disposal would continue to
apply as described elsewhere in this notice and the Asbestos NESHAP.

C. Waste Collection and Handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand
or abrade Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the NESHAP and can be disposed
of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material (such as
A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from
the removal is not subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets the NESHAP to be inapplicable
to waste resulting from roof removal operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described in section
I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal regulations may apply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or other method that similarly damages the roofing material,
is used to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material from the cut (the sawdust or debris)
is considered asbestos containing waste subject to &sect;61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage thresholds
discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated
in accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free
of the sawdust and debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is collected as discussed below in paragraphs
3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste because it is considered
to be Category I nonfriable material (as long as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is
Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material).
EPA further believes that if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and be handled in accordance with
&sect;61.150. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the
roofing material) to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and debris resulting from the
cutting of the roof should be collected as soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until collected
and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends
down close to the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard,
and the spraying device is in operation during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be confined
along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or
vacuum up the damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector that
meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the bulk of
the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of
the remainder of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate roofs), sweeping up the debris and
then wet wiping the surface may be done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that if these decontamination
procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos
waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination procedures are followed, if the remaining
portions of the roof are non-asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the remaining portions are
removed using removal methods that slice, shear, punch or pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining
portions do not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately
wet requirements are not applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's interpretation, the failure
of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material created
by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste,
provided that such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by gentle sweeping) and disposed
of as asbestos waste. Other methods of decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local delegated
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is not collected immediately, it will be necessary
to lightly mist the dust or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in containers. The dust or
debris should be lightly misted frequently enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne emissions,
prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed,
the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining
roof material is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not
further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation,
and provided the roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the appearance of rough, jagged
or damaged edges on the remaining roofing material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that such remaining
roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if
the sawdust or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3,
3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such material ``friable''
for purposes of this interpretive rule or the NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting
operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting
operation. Where roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of the RB cutter (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 where such remaining roofing material near the cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand
pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant will ensure that such friable material need not
be treated or disposed of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied to the friable material
after the roofing material has been collected into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's
view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is followed in operations where roofing material
near the cutline has been rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the decontamination procedures set
forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements would
be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the remaining roofing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debris from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as plastic bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have labels that identify the waste generator (such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name of the roofing contractor, abatement contractor, and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building owner or operator) and the location of the site at which the waste was generated.

4.A.1. Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical, all collected dust and debris from cutting as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any contaminated roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in accordance with &sect;61.154 or
to an EPA-approved site that converts asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with &sect;61.155. During
the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning signs must be affixed to the vehicles.

4.B.2. The waste generator is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the WSR is delivered to the disposal site along
with the waste shipment. If a copy of the WSR signed by the disposal site operator is not returned to the waste generator
within 35 days, the waste generator must contact the transporter and/or the disposal site to determine the status
of the waste shipment. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(3). If the signed WSR is not received within 45 days, the waste generator must
report, in writing, to the responsible NESHAP program agency and send along a copy of the WSR. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(4).
Copies of WSRs, including those signed by the disposal site operator, must be retained for at least 2 years. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
5.1. For those roof removals that are subject to the NESHAP, at least one on-site supervisor trained in the provisions
of the NESHAP must be present during the removal of the asbestos roofing material. 40 CFR 61.145(c)(8). In EPA's view,
this person can be a job foreman, a hired consultant, or someone who can represent the building owner or contractor
responsible for the removal. In addition to the initial training requirement, a refresher training course is required
every 2 years. The NESHAP training requirements became effective on November 20, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2. Asbestos training courses developed specifically to address compliance with the NESHAP in roofing work, as
well as courses developed for other purposes can satisfy this requirement of the NESHAP, as long as the course covers
the areas specified in the regulation. EPA believes that Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) training
courses will, for example, satisfy the NESHAP training requirements. However, nothing in this interpretive rule
or in the NESHAP shall be deemed to require that roofing contractors or roofing workers performing operations covered
by the NESHAP must be trained or accredited under AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization
Act (ASHARA). Likewise, state or local authorities may independently impose additional training, licensing, or
accreditation requirements on roofing contractors performing operations covered by the NESHAP, but such additional
training, licensing or accreditation is not called for by this interpretive rule or the federal NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.3. For removal of Category I asbestos containing roofing material where RB roof cutters or equipment that similarly
damages the asbestos-containing roofing material are used, the NESHAP training requirements (&sect;61.145(c)(8))
apply as discussed in Section I above. It is EPA's intention that removal of Category I asbestos-containing roofing
material using hatchets, axes, knives, and/or the use of spud bars, pry bars and shovels to lift the roofing material,
or similar removal methods that slice, punch, or shear the roof membrane are not subject to the training requirements,
since these methods do not cause the roof removal to be subject to the NESHAP. Likewise, it is EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intention that roof removal operations involving Category II nonfriable ACM are not subject to the training requirements
where such operations are not subject to the NESHAP as discussed in section I above.

marking, for Model Year 1995. This action is pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, which
provides that NHTSA select high-theft lines, with the agreement of the manufacturer, if possible. This final listing
is intended to inform the public, particularly law enforcement groups, of the car lines that are subject to the parts-marking
requirements of the theft prevention standard for Model Year 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 49 CFR part 541, sets forth requirements for inscribing or affixing
identification numbers onto covered original equipment major parts, and the replacement parts for those original
equipment parts, on all vehicles in lines selected as high-theft lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 603(a)(2) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2023(a)(2)) (hereinafter ``the
Cost Savings Act'') specifies that NHTSA shall select the high-theft lines, with the agreement of the manufacturer,
if possible. Section 603(d) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2023(d)) provides that once a line has been designated
as a high-theft line, it remains subject to the theft prevention standard unless that line is exempted under section
605 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2025). Section 605 provides that a manufacturer may petition to have a high theft
line exempted from the requirements of section 602, if the line is equipped with an antitheft device as standard equipment.
The exemption is granted if NHTSA determines that the antitheft device is likely to be as effective as compliance with
the theft prevention standard in reducing and deterring motor vehicle thefts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency annually publishes the names of the lines which were previously listed as high-theft lines and of the lines
which are being listed for the first time and will be subject to the theft prevention standard beginning with Model
Year 1995. It also identifies those car lines that are exempted from the theft prevention standard for the 1995 model
year because of standard equipment antitheft devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Model Year 1995, two car lines, the General Motors Oldsmobile Toronado and the Mazda Amati 800 were renamed as the
Oldsmobile Aurora and the Mazda Millenia, respectively. Also, the Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow have been renamed
the Plymouth and Dodge Neon car lines. These two lines were listed in the MY 1994 Final Listing of High Theft Lines. Unfortunately,
Chrysler did not inform the agency of the new nameplates for these lines until after the publication of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63296), announcing the high-theft lines. This name change became effective beginning with the 1994 model year.
The updated list reflects these name changes. Additionally, for Model Year 1995, the agency selected seven new car
lines, in accordance with the procedures published in 49 CFR part 542, as likely to be high-theft lines. The newly selected
lines are: The Chrysler Cirrus, Chrysler Sebring, Dodge Avenger, Dodge Stratus, Honda Acura (nameplate to be announced),
Subaru Legacy, which was erroneously listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63298) as a new car line for MY 1994, and the Toyota Avalon. In addition to these seven lines, the list of high-theft
lines includes all those lines that were selected as high-theft lines and listed for prior model years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of exempted lines includes five high-theft lines exempted by the Agency, beginning with Model Year 1995,
from the parts-marking requirements of part 541. The five car lines exempted in full are the Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile
Aurora, Mazda Millenia, Volkswagen Cabriolet, and Volkswagen Corrado. Additionally, Toyota requested that the
agency lists its Lexus car lines without its 3-digit engine identifier. Therefore, the updated list reflects this
request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The car lines listed as being subject to the parts-marking standard have previously been selected as high-theft lines
in accordance with the procedures of 49 CFR part 542 and section 603 of the Cost Savings Act. Under these procedures,
manufacturers evaluate new car lines to conclude whether those new lines are likely to be high-theft lines. Manufacturers
submit these evaluations and conclusions to the agency, which makes an independent evaluation, and, on a preliminary
basis, determines whether the new line should be subject to parts marking. NHTSA informs the manufacturer in writing
of its evaluations and determinations, together with the factual information considered by the agency in making
them. The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider these preliminary determinations. Within 60 days of
the receipt of the request, NHTSA makes its final determination. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of these
determinations and its response to the request for reconsideration. If there is no request for reconsideration,
the agency's determination becomes final 45 days after sending the letter with the preliminary determination. Each
of the new car lines on the high-theft list is the subject of a prior final determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the car lines listed as being exempt from the standard have previously been exempted in accordance with
the procedures of 49 CFR part 543 and section 605 of the Cost Savings Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NHTSA finds for good cause that notice and opportunity for comment on these listings are unnecessary.
Further, public comment on the listings of selections and exemptions is not contemplated by Title VI, and is unnecessary
since the selections and exemptions have previously been made in accordance with the statutory criteria and procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons, since this revised listing only informs the public of previous agency actions and does not impose
any additional obligations on any party, NHTSA finds for good cause that the amendment made by this notice should be
effective as soon as it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register

1. Costs and Other Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this rule and determined that is not ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has also considered this notice under Executive Order 12866. As already
noted, the selections in this final rule have previously been made in accordance with the provisions of the Cost Savings
Act, and the manufacturers of the selected lines have already been informed that those lines are subject to the requirements
of part 541 for Model Year 1995. Further, this listing does not actually exempt lines from the requirements of part
541; it only informs the general public of all such previously granted exemptions. Since the only purpose of this final
listing is to inform the public of prior action for Model Year 1995, a full regulatory evaluation has not been prepared.

2. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also considered the effects of this listing under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As noted above,
the effect of this final rule is simply to inform the public of those lines that are subject to the requirements of part
541 for Model Year 1995. The agency believes that listing of this information will not have any economic impact on small
entities.

3. Environmental Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule, and determined that it will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this final rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Civil Justice Reform
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not have a retroactive effect and it does not preempt any state law. Section 613 of the Motor Vehicle
Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2030) provides that judicial review of this rule may be obtained pursuant
to section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004). The Cost Savings Act does not require submission of a petition
for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1988 amendments to the MMPA directed the Secretary of Commerce to implement an interim exemption from the general
prohibition on taking marine mammals in the MMPA for certain incidental takings by commercial fishermen during the
period November 23, 1988, through October 1, 1993, while a permanent regime to govern interactions between marine
mammals and commercial fishing operations was developed. Congress subsequently extended the interim exemption
until May 1, 1994. For background on this issue, refer to earlier regulatory actions (56 FR 23958, May 24, 1991; 57 FR
59832, December 16, 1992; 58 FR 51788, October 5, 1993; and 59 FR 17048, April 11, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MMPA Amendments of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;238, among other things, amended the MMPA by adding a new section
118 to establish a permanent regime to govern interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations.
Section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994 amended section 114(a) of the MMPA to extend the interim exemption through
September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under new section 118 implementing the new regime,
whichever is earlier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to an administrative delay, 50 CFR part 229, the regulations implementing the interim exemption, expired on May
1, 1994, and now must be reissued. This final rule reinstates those regulations until September 1, 1995, unless they
are superseded earlier by regulations implementing new section 118. The reissued regulations are identical to those
that expired except for changes in the addresses of the Southwest and Southeast Regions, NMFS. This reinstatement
is required by section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by section 15 of the MMPA Amendments of 1994. This rule also amends
a note in 50 CFR part 216 to conform to a cross reference from part 50 CFR part 229.

This rule is not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. Under section 114 of the MMPA, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;238,
the interim extension was extended until September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under
new section 118, whichever is earlier. This rule merely reinstates the regulations which, through administrative
delay, were allowed to lapse. The lapsed regulations were subject to full notice and opportunity-for-public-comment
procedures and no useful purpose would be served by delaying their reinstatement to provide notice and opportunity
for public comment. Full notice and opportunity for public comments will be provided for the section 118 regulations
presently being developed. Further, to delay reinstatement of the interim exemption regulations would be inconsistent
with section 114 whose clear intent was to have the exemption and its implementing regulations continue to avoid any
disruption to our commercial fisheries. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, under section
553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), finds, for good cause, that providing notice
and opportunity for public comment is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest. Because reinstatement
of the regulations relieves a restriction of commercial fisheries, under section 553(d)(1) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
this rule is not subject to a 30-day delay in effective date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The regulations in this part implement section 114 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 U.S.C.
1384, Public Law 100&hyph;711, which provides for a 5-year exemption from the Act's prohibition on the taking of marine
mammals incidental to certain commercial fishing operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The provisions of section 114 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, rather than sections 101, 103 and 104,
will govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations by persons using
vessels of the United States, other than vessels used in the eastern tropical Pacific tuna purse seine fishery, and
vessels which have valid fishing permits issued in accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)) for the period from November 23, 1988, through September 1, 1995, or until superseded
by regulations prescribed under section 118, whichever is earlier. Therefore, the regulations in this part supersede
until September 1, 1995, or until superseded by regulations prescribed under section 118, whichever is earlier,
the other provisions for granting incidental take authority to these commercial fishermen, including regulations
at &sect;216.24 of this chapter and guidelines on the taking of small numbers of marine mammals incidental to commercial
fishing operations. (See &sect;216.24 of this chapter).

Categories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The List of Fisheries will be revised and commercial fisheries will be categorized into Category I, Category II or
Category III according to the following criteria. In evaluating incidental takes for purposes of categorizing fisheries,
the Assistant Administrator will consider the definition of take in section 3 of the Act, the language of section 114
of the Act and the legislative history of the 1988 amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category I.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i)(A) There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Congress intended that the fishery should be placed in Category I and there is no documented information indicating
that it should be placed in another Category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Frequent'' means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly
selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Category II.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i)(A) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the
fishery; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors
such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished,
and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional''
incidental taking in the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly
selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period, but that there is little likelihood that more than one marine
mammal will be incidentally taken.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After receipt of a completed initial registration and required fee, an Exemption Certificate and decal will be issued
to the vessel owner. If the Certificate and decal are issued in 1989, a 1990 annual sticker for the decal will be automatically
issued upon receipt of required report(s) for 1989. The Exemption Certificate will be renewed and an annual sticker
issued after receipt of an updated registration, required fee and required report(s) covering all registered Category
I and II fisheries. An interim report should be submitted with the renewal request if fishing under the current Exemption
Certificate will not be completed by December 31.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) All Exemption Certificate holders must ensure that a daily log of fishing effort and incidental takes of marine
mammals is accurately maintained on board the fishing vessel in such form as prescribed by the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries. Fishermen must complete an entry on the report/log form each day they fish. Marine mammal report/log
forms require information on: The fishery, fishing effort, gear type and fish species involved; the marine mammal
species (or description of the animal(s), if species is not known), number, date, and location of marine mammal incidental
takes; type of interaction and any injury to the marine mammal; a description of any intentional takes (i.e., efforts
to deter animals to protect gear, catch, or human life by non-lethal or lethal means); and any loss of fish or gear caused
by marine mammals. With prior approval by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries
Service, alternate report/log forms, such as forms issued by individual states, Fishery Management Councils, or
Indian Governments, which collect the same information required by the National Marine Fisheries Service, are acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A current report/log must be kept on board and must be made available for inspection upon request by any state or
Federal enforcement agent authorized to enforce the Act or any designated agent of the National Marine Fisheries
Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An annual report, consisting of a copy of the required log, must be submitted to the National Marine Fisheries
Service no later than December 31 of each year covering all Categories I and II fisheries for which the Exemption Certificate
holder is registered. This log shall include information for all Categories I and II fisheries for which each Exemption
Certificate holder is registered, whether or not any marine mammals were taken. If a fishing vessel was not used in
a Category I or Category II fishery during an exemption period for which it was registered, a report to that effect must
be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Observer requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If requested by the National Marine Fisheries Service, a Certificate holder engaged in a Category I fishery must
take on board an observer to accompany the vessel on any or all fishing trips in a fishing season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After being notified by the National Marine Fisheries Service that the vessel is required to carry an observer,
the Certificate holder must comply with the notification by providing the specified information within the specified
time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips to facilitate observer placement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The National Marine Fisheries Service may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the facilities
for housing the observer or for carrying out observer functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety
of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.

aboard the vessel for biological processing, if feasible and if requested by the observer. Marine mammals designated
as biological specimens by the observer must be retained in cold storage aboard the vessel, if feasible, until retrieved
by authorized personnel of the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Observers may not bring a civil action against the vessel or vessel owner under any law of the United States for
any illness, disability, injury or death from service as an observer, except in cases of the vessel owner's willful
misconduct or if the observer is engaged by the owner, master or individual in charge of a vessel to perform any duties
in service to the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The National Marine Fisheries Service will provide for the payment of all reasonable costs directly related
to housing and maintaining observers on board vessels and related to maintaining biological specimens as requested
by the observer or required in Exemption Certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any marine mammal incidentally taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further injury and
may be retained only if authorized by an observer, by a condition of the Exemption Certificate, or by a scientific research
permit that is in the possession of the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A Certificate holder or a crew member may intentionally take marine mammals to protect catch, gear or person during
the course of the commercial fishing operation by a means and in a manner not expected to cause death or injury to a marine
mammal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the infliction of the damage to catch, gear or person is substantial and immediate and only after all non-injurious
means authorized by paragraph (c)(5) of this section have been taken, a Certificate holder or crew member may intentionally
injure or kill a marine mammal to protect gear, catch or person; except that it is prohibited for a Certificate holder
or crew member to intentionally lethally take any Steller sea lion, any Alaskan sea otter, any cetacean, any depleted
species (including the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seal), or any endangered or threatened marine
mammal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) No fishing gear, in whole or in part, may be willfully discarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Of any changes in mailing address or vessel ownership within 30 days of such change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Certificates and decals are not transferable. In the event of the sale or change in ownership of the vessel, the
Certificate is void and the new owner must register for an Exemption Certificate and decal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The Assistant Administrator may establish other terms and conditions on Exemption Certificates, including
terms and conditions for specific fisheries necessary to minimize adverse impacts to a marine mammal population
in accordance with the procedures in &sect;229.8(b) of this chapter or to comply with the Endangered Species Act of
1973.

Emergency regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is having an immediate
and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population, or in the case of Steller sea lions and North Pacific
fur seals, that more than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will be incidentally killed during a calendar year in all fisheries
combined, the Assistant Administrator will issue emergency regulations to prevent, to the maximum extent practicable,
any further taking. Any such regulations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Will be issued only after consultation with Regional Fishery Management Councils, state fishery agencies and
treaty Indian tribal governments, where appropriate, and will, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering
with existing Regional, state or tribal fishery management plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Will take into account the economics of the fishery and the availability of existing technology to minimize incidental
taking to the extent that elimination of the adverse effects on the marine mammal population will allow; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) May take effect immediately upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will remain in effect for no more than 180 days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is earlier; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Will be terminated by notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at an earlier date if the Assistant Administrator determines that the reasons for the emergency regulations no longer

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special regulations or conditions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is not having an
immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population, but that it will likely have a significant
adverse impact over a period of time longer than one year, the Assistant Administrator will request Regional Fishery
Management Councils, state fisheries agencies or treaty Indian tribal governments, where appropriate, to initiate
or take action to minimize such impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Councils, states or tribes do not take appropriate action in a reasonable period of time, the Assistant Administrator
will issue special regulations or impose special conditions on Exemption Certificates to mitigate the adverse impacts.

When a quota for the commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species in any portion of the fishery
management area is projected by the Regional Director to be reached on or by a certain date, the Secretary will, by notice
issued under &sect;661.23, close the commercial or recreational fishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portion
of the fishery management area to which the quota applies as of the date the quota is projected to be reached.

In the annual management measures for ocean salmon fisheries (59 FR 22999, May 4, 1994), NMFS announced that the 1994
recreational fishery in the area between Humbug Mountain, OR, and Horse Mountain, CA, would be open May 1 through June
30, 1994, or attainment of the 10,300 chinook salmon quota, whichever occurs first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The best available information on June 6, 1994, indicated that recreational catches in the area totaled 10,570 chinook
salmon through June 5, 1994. To provide public notice of at least 24 hours, the determination was made to close the fishery
at 12 midnight, June&blank;7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Oregon Department
of Fish and Wildlife, and the California Department of Fish and Game regarding this closure. The States of Oregon and
California will manage the recreational fishery in state waters adjacent to this area of the exclusive economic zone
in accordance with this Federal action. In accordance with the inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.23, actual
notice to fishermen of this action was given prior to 2400 hours local time, June 7, 1994, by telephone hotline number
(206) 526&hyph;6667 or (800) 662&hyph;9825 and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on channel 16 VHF-FM
and 2182 kHz. Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce has determined that good cause exists
for this document to be issued without affording a prior opportunity for public comment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 213 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make a determination
of the significance of the contribution of nonroad sources to nonattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) in more than one nonattainment area. If the Agency makes a positive determination
of significance, it must then promulgate regulations that will result in reductions in emissions from nonroad sources.
In today's action, EPA is finalizing the determination of significance of emissions from nonroad engines. EPA is
also promulgating standards for carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen
(NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

) and smoke emissions from large nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts (kW) in power,
with exclusions for certain types of engines. The NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority for the actions in this notice is granted to EPA by sections 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213, 215,
216, and 301 of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7521, 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543, 7547, 7549, 7550,
7601(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) were enacted in order to broaden and strengthen the
CAA. While the CAA had long specifically authorized EPA regulation of on-highway vehicle and engine emissions, the
1990 amendments extended EPA's authority to regulate nonroad vehicles and engines. Specifically, revised section
213 directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine whether emissions
of CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone
or CO in more than one area which has failed to attain the NAAQS for ozone or CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes
of new nonroad engines and vehicles that contribute to such air pollution if nonroad emissions are determined to be
significant. EPA may also regulate other emissions from new nonroad engines or vehicles if the Agency determines
that they contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Finally,
EPA is to regulate emissions from new locomotives by 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study required by section 213(a)(1) was completed in November 1991.

 The purpose of this final rule is to implement section 213(a) (2), (3), (4), and (5) by determining that emissions from
nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone and CO nonattainment and by promulgating regulations
containing standards applicable to emissions from certain nonroad engines and vehicles.

III. Determination of Significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213(a)(2) of the CAA provides that after notice and public comment, EPA is to determine, based on the Nonroad
Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter called the Nonroad Study), whether nonroad emissions are significant
contributors to ozone or CO in more than one nonattainment area. Based on the results of the Nonroad Study and consideration
of the public comments discussed below, EPA is finalizing its proposed affirmative significance determination
in today's rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of commenters did not address EPA's proposed determination of significance. Of those who did, most were
in opposition, including organizations representing equipment manufacturers and users. Expressing support for
the determination were some engine manufacturers, state and local organizations and environmental groups. A summary
of comments is found in the Response to Comments document contained in the docket for this rule. Major comments are
discussed below, accompanied by EPA's response.

1. Use of the EKMA Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that EPA had not adequately demonstrated a significant contribution to ozone or CO nonattainment
from nonroad engines or vehicles, as directed by the Act. These commenters argued that EPA had shown only the nonroad
contribution to ozone precursor and CO emission inventories, and not the nonroad contribution to ozone formation
or ozone and CO nonattainment. Some commenters questioned EPA's use of the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA
model) as the basis for its air quality analysis, and they suggested that EPA should have used a grid-based air quality
model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the Agency did conduct photochemical modeling. Using the EKMA model, the Agency analyzed the effects of
nonroad engine emission controls on ozone concentrations. The results of this analysis, presented in more detail
in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (ref. 58 FR 28809, May 17, 1993), showed that by eliminating nonroad engines
in the studied areas, ozone levels would drop between four and 13 parts per billion (ppb) below current levels. This
amounts to levels roughly three to eight percent lower than current levels in the 16 ozone nonattainment areas included
in the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EKMA model has been used by the Agency for a number of years. Although the decision to use this model was driven to
some extent by time and resource constraints, the Agency maintains its position that this model is valid and appropriate
for the nonroad analysis. The Agency may utilize grid-based air quality modeling in future analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Agency has traditionally based regulatory decisions on pollutant emission levels and the potential
for their reduction. Because of the wide variability inherent in photochemical modeling (source emission levels,
emission transport, and meteorological effects including ambient temperatures, cloud cover, sunlight intensity,
wind patterns, and so forth), the Agency has typically relied on estimates of potential reductions in source emission
inventories as the basis for regulatory analyses. These emission reduction estimates and the well established VOC/NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 link with tropospheric ozone formation, in conjunction with ozone monitors showing unacceptably high ambient ozone
levels, have formed the basis of the Agency's regulatory approach toward ozone control for many years. In addition,
as discussed in the NPRM, the Senate Committee Report, in discussing the significance of the contribution of nonroad
emissions to ozone problems, specifically discussed the percentage of nationwide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions attributed to nonroad engines. Thus, the Senate clearly understood the relationship between emissions
of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOCs to the creation of ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM discussed in detail the Nonroad Study's findings regarding the contribution from nonroad sources of summertime
VOCs and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These findings clearly show that emissions from nonroad engines are a major source of VOCs and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as well as CO in most, if not all of the nonattainment areas studied. Given the clear link between VOCs and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the formation of ozone, there can be no question that emissions from nonroad engines are significant contributors
to ozone formation in at least two ozone nonattainment areas. Therefore, the Agency has met the CAA mandate to ``determine
*&blank;*&blank;* whether emissions *&blank;*&blank;* from new and existing nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles
*&blank;*&blank;* are significant contributors to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in more than one area
which has failed to attain the national ambient air quality standards *&blank;*&blank;*''

Some commenters asserted that EPA failed to properly consider both the transport of ozone precursor emissions and
the natural decay of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 having a lifetime of only six to ten hours according to one commenter. One commenter suggested EPA had erroneously
assumed that ozone precursors emitted in rural areas are transported toward, and never away from, urban areas. Some
commenters suggested that equipment operated primarily in rural areas should be exempted from regulation since
these areas do not have air quality problems. Another commenter argued that reducing NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can increase ozone, therefore EPA must first show that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions will result in reduced ozone nonattainment before promulgating regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those commenters suggesting the Agency had erroneously assumed that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 always will be transported toward, rather than away from, the urban core, may have misunderstood the Agency's assumption.
The Agency assumed only that pollution transport 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
can 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
occur toward the urban core, thereby contributing to high source emission inventories. It is obvious that different
days will produce different transport patterns, and that the potential for rural NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and/or rural ozone to be transported toward the urban core exists.

major East Coast cities into attainment of the ozone standard. In addition, a National Academy of Sciences Study
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 states that, ``*&blank;*&blank;* ozone in rural areas of the eastern U.S. is limited by the availability of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

and New York City *&blank;*&blank;* will probably be necessary in addition to or instead of VOC control to alleviate
the ozone problem in many cities and regions.'' Even under those circumstances where a NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

further NO

The Agency disagrees with the contention that a specific numerical standard for significance must be determined
prior to considering whether nonroad emissions are significant. When Congress mandated that EPA determine the significance
of nonroad emissions, Congress could have given EPA a specific numerical mandate for determining whether such emissions
are significant contributors. Instead, Congress gave EPA wide discretion to determine whether the emissions of
NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, VOCs and CO from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone or CO concentrations. In any
case, any reasonable indicator of significance would conclude that emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles
were indeed significant contributors. As presented in the NPRM and discussed above, the Agency's photochemical
modeling showed that without nonroad sources, the ozone levels of 16 of the 19 analyzed nonattainment areas would
decrease from three to eight percent from their current levels and differences in excess of five percent were indicated
in eight of the 16 areas. Additionally, NO

 emission levels from nonroad sources were found to be exceeded by only one other source: the generation of electrical
power. Nonroad VOC emission levels were found to be exceeded by only two other sources: light-duty highway vehicles
and solvent evaporation. Nonroad CO emission levels were found to be exceeded by only two other sources: light-duty
highway vehicles and residential fuel use. In addition, emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles accounted for
over ten percent of the inventory of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) VOCs in 12 to 14 of the 19 nonattainment areas studied in the nonroad study;

As pointed out in the NPRM, in numerous nonattainment areas, other sources are regulated that have lower emissions
than the total from nonroad engines in the area. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the higher contributions
from nonroad sources in those areas are also significant enough to justify the regulation of NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that some equipment covered by the proposed regulations operates primarily (almost 80 percent
based on number of units) in areas already meeting federal clean air requirements; therefore, these commenters concluded
that such equipment should not be regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that these pieces of equipment can reasonably be expected to contribute to ozone nonattainment.
Also, the Agency has determined that it should not regulate engines only in urban nonattainment areas. Most commenters
made strong arguments substantiating the need for national uniformity of treatment for all equipment incorporating
regulated engines regardless of the intended geographic area of equipment use. Moreover, Title II of the Act generally
requires national regulation of mobile sources, given the inherent ability of such sources to move from one area to
another. Also, as discussed, nonroad sources have been clearly shown to contribute significantly to pollution in
several nonattainment areas.

5. Significance Determination for Classes and Categories of Nonroad Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that various subcategories of nonroad equipment (e.g., farm equipment, mining equipment)
individually represent only a small contribution to national pollutant inventories and to nonattainment and that
a significance determination should be made for each specific subcategory of nonroad engine, not for nonroad engines
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These comments have misinterpreted the clear language of section 213(a). Paragraphs one and two of section 213(a)
make it clear that EPA's determination of significance should be based on whether emissions from all new and existing
nonroad engines are significant contributors to ozone or CO concentrations. There is no indication that the significance
determination should be based on contributions from various subcategories of nonroad engines or vehicles. By contrast,
if the Administrator makes an affirmative decision regarding significance, then section 213(a)(3) requires the
Administrator to promulgate regulations for those classes and categories of nonroad engines and vehicles ``which
in the Administrator's judgment cause, or contribute to, such air pollution.'' This mandate does not include any
reference to a determination of significance for classes and categories. Thus, the Agency believes that Congress
did not intend a showing of significant contribution to be required for regulation of classes or categories of nonroad
engines and vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation is echoed by the language in section 213(a)(4) which allows the Agency to regulate new nonroad
engine emissions that were not referred to in the Nonroad Study. Under this paragraph, if the Agency determines that
any such emissions significantly contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the
public health or welfare, the Agency may promulgate regulations applicable to those classes or categories of new
nonroad engines and vehicles which in the Administrator's judgment cause or contribute to such air pollution. Once
again, there is a reference to significant contribution regarding the initial determination on emissions from all
nonroad engines or vehicles, but there is no such reference to significance in the subsequent language regarding
regulation of classes or categories of engines and vehicles. Therefore, it seems clear that Congress intended that
a showing of significance is not required for regulation of classes or categories of nonroad engines and vehicles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that EPA had misinterpreted the statute's requirements based on a perceived inconsistency
between that interpretation and the Agency's proposed consent decree settling several lawsuits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This commenter stated that, in the proposed consent decree, EPA had implicitly acknowledged its obligation to make
the significance determination for each category or class of products it intends to regulate by specifically reserving
its ``right'' to determine that large gasoline and/or small diesel nonroad engines do not cause or contribute to air
pollution within the meaning of section 213(a)(3). Such a reservation, this commenter argued, would be meaningless
if EPA were permitted, as proposed in the NPRM, to regulate any category or class of nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle
regardless of its contribution to ozone or CO concentrations in nonattainment areas.

The Agency disagrees with the assertion that there is an inconsistency between the Agency's proposed consent decree
and the NPRM. In fact, the consent decree does not discuss any determination of ``significant contribution'' for
classes or categories of nonroad engines. The decree only discusses ``contribution''. The Agency assumes this comment
is meant to suggest that prior to regulating, EPA must first show that each equipment type (agricultural, construction,
mining, and so forth) contributes significantly to nonattainment. As discussed above, the Agency interprets the
Act to provide for regulation of any classes or categories of nonroad engines and vehicles that can be shown to cause
or contribute to air pollution. The NPRM discussed the contribution to air pollution of the engine size and type being
regulated today. The Agency reserves the right to use other class or category types in future nonroad emissions regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters stated that EPA's use of CMSAs to define the urban areas was inappropriate. These commenters asserted
that since many CMSAs encompass an area roughly equivalent to a 100 mile diameter, much of the CMSA is rural. Consequently,
EPA has assumed a uniform distribution of nonroad equipment resulting in as many farm tractors in downtown New York
City as in the surrounding countryside, according to comments.

Comments that EPA assumed a uniform distribution of equipment within areas evaluated in the Nonroad Study, thereby
resulting in an equal number of farm tractors in both downtown New York City and the surrounding countryside, are incorrect.
The equipment population distributions used in the Nonroad Study were derived from estimates of activity levels
within specific counties of each CMSA. A county, such as that containing Manhattan, would presumably show an activity
index for agricultural equipment presumably at or near zero. Therefore, the agricultural equipment population
estimate for Manhattan would also be at or near zero.

7. Support of the Agency's Determination of Significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters supported the Agency's proposed significance determination. One engine manufacturer supported
grouping the 80-plus types of nonroad equipment together instead of evaluating and regulating each type of equipment
separately. This commenter also stated that it is not cost effective to build parallel regulated/unregulated engine
families for the U.S. market to support regulated and unregulated applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State commented that it is particularly important that any EPA regulation control emissions from construction
and farm equipment, as those emissions cannot be controlled by state or local agencies. It cited its own estimates
that agricultural equipment contributes over 90 tons per day of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the State of California. Much of these emissions occur in the San Joaquin valley and are a primary contributor to
the nonattainment status of that overwhelmingly agricultural area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a major city agreed with the Agency's significance determination, stating that further reductions
in VOC, CO, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were essential to achieving attainment. A regional association of states also supported the Agency's determination
of significance, stating that engines subject to the proposed standards are responsible for approximately 11 percent
of all NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emitted in its region, making control of emissions from these sources critical to their efforts to meet the statutory
requirements of the CAA. An environmental association stated that without significant reductions from nonroad
engines, states will not be able to develop long-term plans for the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality
standards.

IV. Definition of Nonroad Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA section 216(10) defines the term ``nonroad engine'' as ``an internal combustion engine (including the fuel system)
that is not used in a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or that is not subject to standards promulgated
under section 111 or 202.'' Section 111(a)(3) of the CAA notes, however, that ``Nothing in Title II of this Act relating
to nonroad engines shall be construed to apply to stationary internal combustion engines.''

1. Original Proposed Definition of Nonroad Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA proposed that the engines encompassed by the statutory definition of nonroad engine included
internal combustion engines meeting one of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any internal combustion engine (including the fuel system) of any size which is used to propel any vehicle if the
engine is not otherwise excluded from this definition (see below). This includes any internal combustion engine
which serves a dual function (that is, to both propel a vehicle and operate a device while stationary), such as a mobile
crane; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any internal combustion engine which is located in (or on) a nonroad vehicle and which is an integral part of the
nonroad vehicle at the time of the nonroad vehicle's manufacture and which is not otherwise excluded from this definition
(see below); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any internal combustion engine or combination of internal combustion engines arranged to function together,
regardless of application, with a combined output of less than 175 hp, unless otherwise excluded from this definition
(see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several specific exclusions were included in the proposed definition of nonroad engines. An internal combustion
engine would not be considered a nonroad engine if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The engine is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the Act, regardless of size; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The engine is located on a trailer or other platform attached to (not an integral part of) a nonroad vehicle or is
otherwise not an integral part of a nonroad vehicle and the engine has an output greater than or equal to 175 hp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received numerous comments in response to this NPRM definition. The vast majority of commenters opposed all or
part of the proposed definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary reason cited by commenters for their opposition to the proposed definition relates to the use of a horsepower
(hp) cut-off point as the means for determining which internal combustion engines are classified as nonroad engines.
The commenters asserted that the use of a horsepower cut-off point would allow engines used in mobile applications
to be regulated as stationary sources, and would allow stationary engines to be regulated as mobile sources, solely
on the basis of engine size. The commenters noted that this would result in identical sources being regulated in a different
manner based solely on engine power. Commenters further indicated that the use of a horsepower cut-off point is arbitrary
and not reflective of the realities of portable or transportable equipment, which can be and are moved from one area
to another and, therefore, should be classified as nonroad regardless of horsepower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to these commenters, an engine should be classified on the basis of its use as mobile or stationary, rather
than on its horsepower. In other words, the determination as to whether an engine is a nonroad engine should depend
on whether the engine is either used in equipment that is mobile (that is, self-propelled, portable or transportable),
or in equipment that is in fact used in a stationary manner at a particular location for an extended period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters indicated that to do otherwise could result in costly and unnecessary administrative burdens
for manufacturers. According to these commenters, such administrative burdens would result from engines and equipment
that would be wrongly subjected to a myriad of different mobile and stationary source regulations in states and local
air quality management districts. The commenters also indicated that regulation by a multitude of regulatory agencies
could result in restricting the geographic operating range of certain engines and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters indicated that it would be contrary to the intent of the Act. In support of this position, these
commenters noted that Congress did not establish a horsepower cut-off point in the Act for distinguishing between
nonroad and stationary engines, and did not require that nonroad vehicles be self-propelled to fall within the nonroad
definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments from state and local air pollution control agencies also opposed the use of a horsepower cut-off point
for determining whether internal combustion engines would be classified as nonroad engines. Local air pollution
control agencies noted that they are currently regulating stationary engines under 175 hp and would lose the authority
to continue regulating these engines under the proposed nonroad definition.

2. Revised Definition of Nonroad Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments received regarding the nonroad definition proposed in the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA revised
the nonroad engine definition. The revised definition was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51595). The comment period was reopened until October 25, 1993, so that interested parties
could provide comments on the following revised definition of nonroad engine: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except as discussed in (2) below, a nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing
another function (such as a mobile crane); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawn mowers
and string trimmers); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) That, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable
of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to,
wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, platform or mounting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The engine is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the Act; or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The engine otherwise included in (1)(iii) remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months,
or a shorter period of time where such period is representative of normal annual source operation at a stationary source
that resides at a fixed location for more than 12 months (e.g., seasonal operations such as canning facilities.) A
location is any site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an
engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included
in calculating the consecutive time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A portable generator engine which functions as a permanent back-up generator and which is replaced by a different
engine (or engines) that performs the same function would be an example of engines covered by (2)(iii). In such a case,
the cumulative residence time of both generators, including the time between removal of the original engine and installation
of the replacement, would be counted toward the consecutive residence time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intended the revised definition of nonroad engines to address concerns expressed by the commenters in response
to the definition originally proposed. Under the revised definition, an internal combustion engine would be a nonroad
engine if it is used in equipment that is self-propelled or intended to be propelled while performing its function,
or if it is portable or transportable. The revised definition specifically distinguishes between nonroad engines
and stationary internal combustion engines on the basis of engine mobility and residence time, rather than on horsepower
size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intended that stationary internal combustion engines be all internal combustion engines regulated by a federal
New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act and all internal combustion engines that
are neither nonroad engines nor engines used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition. Moreover,
the revised definition specifically states that portable and transportable engines remaining in a particular location
for over 12 months are not nonroad engines (this excludes engines in self-propelled equipment and equipment intended
to be propelled while performing its intended function), thus ensuring that engines that are actually used in a stationary
manner are considered stationary engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised nonroad engine definition excluded from nonroad regulation those engines that are used for normal annual
source operations at fixed stationary sources that only operate on a seasonal basis, such as canneries. This provision
is designed to ensure that engines that operate as integral parts of these stationary sources are considered stationary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised nonroad engine definition also included a provision that if an engine is replaced by another engine within
the 12 month period, the replacement engine should be considered in calculating the consecutive time period. This
provision is designed to ensure that where an internal combustion engine is necessary for the operation of a stationary
facility, the replacement of one particular engine with another would not prevent the engines from being included
as part of the stationary facility.

EPA included as a prohibited act any attempt to circumvent the residence time exclusion of a portable or transportable
engine in (2)(iii) by means of removing the engine from its location for a period and then returning it to that same location.
In such cases, the time between removal of the engine and its return to service (or replacement) would be counted towards
the time period specified in (2)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of comments received on the revised definition supported the usage-based definition, as opposed to
the initially proposed power-based definition. Still, most commenters requested that EPA make two modifications
to the revised nonroad engine definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first modification requested by the commenters relates to section (2)(ii) of the revised definition which stated
that an engine is not a nonroad engine if it is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the CAA. The commenters expressed
concern that this portion of the definition would allow states to promulgate state regulations under the authority
of section 111, creating a loophole in the state preemption framework, whereby states would be able to regulate preempted
engines. They contended that this would result in dual standards for an engine, as both stationary and nonroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second modification requested by the commenters relates to the application of the 12 month residence time limitation
to seasonal operations. While most commenters agreed with the proposal to use a 12 month residence time limit to distinguish
between mobile and stationary use of portable or transportable engines, several commenters opposed the proposal
to consider residence time based on ``seasonal'' use. These commenters asserted that excluding an undefined group
of engines for an indeterminate period of time, between one and 365 days, is neither reasonable nor enforceable. Moreover,
the same commenters requested that EPA clarify that the 12 month residence time applies only to those portable and
transportable engines which are integral parts of fixed stationary sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the 12 month time limit on the grounds that it could create a regulatory vacuum which would result
in some engines escaping all nonroad engine and stationary engine regulations. In support of the revised nonroad
engine definition, another commenter stated that the equipment used on a military installation should be designed
so emissions are reduced by the engine manufacturer and not by the end user. The commenter requested that EPA clarify
the term ``location'' in a manner that would permit a ``location'' to exist within a stationary source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments from a State agency supported the elimination of the horsepower criteria for nonroad engines, but expressed
concern that the new definition would cause it to lose permitting authority for engines it was currently regulating
as stationary engines. The commenter suggested that those states with permitting programs be allowed to maintain
permitting authority over those engines which they had previously determined to be stationary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One local air pollution agency disagreed with EPA's conclusion that portable engines are nonroad engines. In support
of its position, the agency cited title V of the CAA as evidence that Congress recognized that some stationary sources
were moveable. If EPA were to adopt a definition based on residence time, the agency requested that three months, rather
than a year, be the cutoff point beyond which an engine would no longer be considered nonroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the revised nonroad definition eliminates the potential for the arbitrary classification
of internal combustion engines as nonroad or stationary sources based on engine size. Rather, as noted by the commenters,
the revised definition is based on the use of the engine, which is a more appropriate and reliable indicator of its classification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered the modification requested by some commenters regarding that portion of the definition that provides
an internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if it is regulated under CAA section 111. The Agency has amended
the revised definition to provide that an internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if ``The engine is regulated
by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act.'' Thus, under provision (2)(ii),
national emission standards for an internal combustion engine must be promulgated before it is classified as a stationary
engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the comments, EPA believes that it is appropriate to exclude from the nonroad definition engines that
remain at sources that only operate on a seasonal basis. Although such sources, such as canning facilities, may operate
for less than 12 months in any one year, they operate regularly for a similar time period year after year. Operations
for a seasonal source generally occur at the same location, rather than traveling between different states or regions.
Engines that are located at a seasonal source during the full annual operations period of that source should be considered
a part of that source. They are clearly integral parts of these facilities. Moreover, as such sources produce emissions
that can be calculated on a regular basis, a local air quality agency or other authority should be able to reasonably
enforce stationary source regulations. As a result, the Agency has maintained the seasonal source exclusion. However,
as requested by several commenters, EPA has revised the language for the exclusion to make it clearer. EPA believes
that a seasonal source is a stationary source because it functions at only one location for its full annual operating
period, even if that period is less than 12 months. EPA has specified in the final regulations that a seasonal source
must remain at a single location on a permanent basis (that is, at least two years) and must operate approximately three
months or more each year. EPA also clarified that an engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at
the source for the full annual operating period of the source. This should eliminate any confusion as to whether certain
sources are considered to be seasonal sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also disagrees with commenters who believe that only engines ``fixed'' in place for more than 12 months should
be excluded from the nonroad definition. An internal combustion engine can be stationary without being ``affixed''
to the ground or other structures. To require otherwise could result in the improper classification of internal combustion
engines. For example, an engine that is not bolted or otherwise attached to a structure but remains at one location
for five years would be classified under the commenters' proposition as a nonroad engine, even though it operates
in a stationary manner, as evidenced by its remaining at the same location for an extended period of time. Therefore,
the Agency has decided that the fact that an engine is not ``affixed'' to the ground or other structure does not necessarily
identify the internal combustion engine as a nonroad engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also believes that 12 months is the appropriate time limit for determining whether an internal combustion
engine which is either portable or transportable is to be classified as a stationary engine. Generally, engines that
remain at one site for more than 12 months will stay at that site either permanently or for an extended period of time.
In such cases, local or state air quality agencies should be able to regulate the applicable engines as stationary
sources, since the emissions impact is occurring over a period of time which is likely to have a measurable impact on
an area's air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``location'' has been defined so as to permit a ``location'' to exist within a facility. Section (2)(iii)
of the revised definition defines ``location'' as ``any single site at a building, structure, facility or installation.''
This definition of ``location'' provides more precision in classifying an engine as nonroad if the engine is actually
intended to be used in a mobile manner within a stationary source. In other words, an engine would be considered nonroad
if it moves to different sites within a stationary source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree with the assertion made by one commenter that title V of the CAA evidences Congress' recognition
that some stationary sources are moveable. Title V of the CAA deals with the permitting of stationary sources and not
with the determination as to which internal combustion engines are nonroad engines and which are stationary engines.

4. Nonroad Engines Manufactured Prior to the Effective Date of This Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the initial NPRM, EPA noted that it interprets the exclusion in CAA section 302(z) to apply only to those internal
combustion engines that are manufactured after the effective date of these regulations. EPA stated that this interpretation
avoids a regulatory gap for engines manufactured between the promulgation of the CAA and the date that these regulations
are promulgated. EPA received several comments opposing this interpretation. These commenters claimed that the
language in section 302(z) applied to all nonroad engines at the time of the passage of the 1990 CAAA, even though that
term had not yet been defined with any reasonable clarity. In addition, commenters asserted that nonroad engines
are generally preempted from regulation by states under title II of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to believe that internal combustion engines manufactured prior to the effective date of these regulations
should not be considered preempted nonroad engines. First, EPA believes that until the regulations finalizing the
definition of nonroad engine (as well as the regulations determining the scope of the term ``new'' as applied to nonroad
engines) were complete, no state or other entity could be assured whether such engines would be defined as nonroad
engines or as stationary internal combustion engines and the extent to which state regulations of such engines was
preempted. Congress clearly intended EPA to determine which internal combustion engines should be defined as nonroad
engines and which should be stationary internal combustion engines.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 As has been discussed above, the final definition of nonroad engine promulgated today is substantially revised from
the definition originally proposed. Moreover, as the comments reveal, numerous other definitions of nonroad engine
have been suggested to the Agency, many of which are either significantly broader or significantly narrower than
EPA's final definition. EPA believes that if the exclusionary language of section 302(z) were applied before EPA's
definition of nonroad engine became final, states would have been frustrated from regulating any internal combustion
engines manufactured during that time, given the uncertain nature of such engines. For example, a state would not
know whether to include regulations of engines in its New Source Review program, or whether such engines should be
regulated in a separate in-use operation program. Further, until the initial regulations regarding nonroad engines
were finalized, states could not determine the extent to which their regulation of such engines would be preempted,
and thus were hampered from going forward with specific programs to regulate such engines. EPA believes that Congress
did not intend states to be prevented from regulating these engines before EPA defined what they were. In particular,
EPA believes that permits for internal combustion engines issued prior to July 18, 1994, are not precluded under section
209 and 302(z) if the permits apply to internal combustion engines manufactured before July 18, 1994, even if those
engines are of a type that has been defined by EPA to be nonroad engines.

Moreover, even to the extent such engines are defined to be nonroad engines in this final rule, such engines were not
preempted from state regulations under section 209 prior to the effective date of these regulations. The two sections
of the Act preempting state regulation of nonroad engines, section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a) (as incorporated
by section 213(d)), refer to ``nonroad engines subject to regulation under this Act'' or to engines ``subject to this
part.'' EPA believes that, until EPA promulgated final regulations defining nonroad engines and subjecting such
engines to regulation, these engines were not preempted from state regulation under the Act, nor were they subject
to any regulation under title II of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, some of the comments regarding the definition of nonroad engines and the issue of grandfathering examined
whether grandfathering subjects an engine to dual regulation (i.e., regulation both by the state as a stationary
source and by EPA as a nonroad engine). There is no such risk in this instance because EPA has not subjected any engines
manufactured before the effective date of this regulation to regulation as new nonroad engines. Such engines, if
they are regulated at all, are regulated under title I programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, it should be noted that the vast majority of these engines are no longer new nonroad engines. Thus, even if
they are viewed as preempted nonroad engines, they are subject to in-use regulation by states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below in section VI. U. (definition of new), states are not precluded from regulating the use of nonroad
engines. Nothing in section 209 of the CAA prohibits local pollution control districts from regulating the operation
of nonroad engines, such as the hours of usage, sulfur limits in fuel (state fuel restrictions may in some cases be precluded
under section 211), daily mass emission limits, and title I operating permits. In addition, local districts can impose
a permitting fee consistent with the costs incurred for various operational expenditures, such as monitoring usage
and administrative functions. EPA believes that utilization of this option will assist local districts in achieving
their targeted emission levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, states are not prevented from requiring retrofitting of nonroad engines, as long as such requirements
do not amount to a standard relating back to the original design of the engine by the original engine manufacturer.
As discussed below, EPA believes modest retrofit requirements may be required after a reasonable amount of time,
such as at the time of reregistration or rebuilding. Moreover, after a sufficient time has passed after an engine ceases
to be new, for example, after the end of the useful life of the engine, a state may institute more significant retrofit
requirements. As the court stated in

but to prevent the burden on interstate commerce which would result if, instead of uniform standards, every state
and locality were left free to impose different standards for exhaust emission control devices for the manufacture
and sale of new cars.'' The Act does not intend preemption of regulations, like regulation of the use of nonroad engines
or modest retrofit requirements after an engine is no longer new, that ``would cause only minimal interference with
interstate commerce, since they would be directed at intrastate activities and the burden of compliance would be
on individual owners and not on manufacturers and distributors.''

EPA has added an interpretive rule in the form of an appendix to these regulations summarizing its views on these issues
(see Appendix I to subpart A of part 89: Internal combustion engines manufactured prior to the effective date of the
nonroad engine definition). This interpretive rule does not supersede, alter, replace, or change the scope of these
regulations. The appendix is intended to be interpretive guidance and is not final agency action subject to judicial
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments received from several of California's local air quality districts, the Agency is concerned about
the impact of the nonroad definition on the unique situation that exists in these areas, that is, the current local
regulation of certain engines as stationary sources which, as a result of the nonroad definition, will become nonroad
engines subject to emission standards promulgated only by EPA. According to the commenters, classification of these
engines as nonroad by EPA may negatively affect the ability of local districts to achieve targeted emission reduction
levels. To some extent, the grandfathering in of certain engines, discussed above, addresses this concern by ensuring
that engines regulated prior to the effective date of this rulemaking continue to be regulated in the same manner.
Nevertheless, this may not, in all situations, allay concerns regarding the overall impact that classification
of these engines as nonroad will have on an area. The Agency believes, however, that any additional concerns that may
exist following the effective date of this rule can be addressed by local air quality districts through their regulation
of nonroad engine operations.

5. Equating Nonroad Engines With Nonroad Vehicles and Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received one comment on the October 4, 1993 notice that opposed the revised definition of the term ``nonroad engine''
because, according to the commenter, the definition equated nonroad engines with nonroad equipment. This comment
states that, by defining nonroad engines in terms of their use ``in or on a piece of equipment,'' EPA exceeded its authority
because, according to the commenter, the CAA only authorizes EPA to regulate nonroad engines and vehicles, not nonroad
equipment. This comment argues that EPA does not have equal authority over off-highway mobile cranes, which are nonroad
vehicles, and lawnmowers and string trimmers, which are nonvehicular nonroad equipment. This comment asks EPA to
acknowledge that it lacks authority to regulate nonroad equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, EPA disagrees with the commenter's contention that the nonroad engine definition ``equates'' nonroad engines
with nonroad equipment. The nonroad engine definition is written to include only engines, and cannot be read to include
equipment. The definition clearly refers only to ``engines used in'' certain applications, not to the applications
themselves. Moreover, this definition has been promulgated pursuant to numerous comments received by the Agency,
discussed above, that assert that the most appropriate definition of nonroad engine is one that refers to the use or
application of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also notes that this rulemaking does not promulgate any standards for nonroad equipment, only for nonroad engines.
The only restriction on nonroad equipment manufacturers in this rulemaking is a prohibition on the use of uncertified
nonroad engines manufactured after the applicable implementation dates. This prohibition is necessary to enforce
the engine-based standards and is authorized under the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA does not agree that it lacks authority to regulate nonroad equipment or particular applications
of nonroad engines. CAA section 213, as well as section 301(a), provide EPA with authority to regulate both nonroad
equipment and particular applications of nonroad engines, as well as nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress used the terms ``nonroad engine,'' ``equipment,'' and ``vehicle'' interchangeably (see, e.g., S. Rep.,
Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee on Environment and Public Works to accompany
S. 1630, December 20, 1989, at 104&hyph;105). It is EPA's belief that Congress intended nonroad vehicles and engines
to be inclusive terms covering all manner and types of equipment not defined as motor vehicles, vehicles for competition,
or stationary sources (see, e.g., H. Rep., Legislative History of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Committee
on Energy and Commerce to accompany H.R. 3030, May 17, 1990, at 310). There is no evidence that Congress intended to
limit the reach of its nonroad mandate to self-propelled vehicles; on the contrary, it appears that Congress used
the term vehicle to include any carrier for the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213 and the rest of the CAA provide EPA with authority to regulate nonroad equipment and particular applications
of nonroad engines in nonroad equipment. The Act provides equal authority to regulate off-highway mobile cranes,
which are nonroad vehicles, and lawnmowers, which are nonroad equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the interpretation of EPA's authority suggested by the commenter would undermine the environmental and
public health benefits of the nonroad emission reduction program by creating a gaping loophole. EPA can find no evidence
that Congress intended the regulation of certain nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment that cause or contribute
to air pollution, but not the regulation of others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there is a practical interrelationship between an engine and the equipment that houses it or is powered by
it. Equipment or vehicle characteristics may have a significant impact on the emissions associated with the operation
of the engine. The nonroad engine definition relies to a great extent on this interrelationship between an engine
and a piece of equipment to determine whether an engine is a mobile or stationary source. In the future development
of the nonroad program, EPA may determine that it is most effective to test and certify a nonroad engine integrally
with its related equipment, rather than separately. Additionally, it may become necessary and appropriate to regulate
aspects of equipment to control fuel spillage, evaporative emissions, or refueling emissions. EPA believes that
the CAA provides authority for such regulation. EPA does not believe Congress, in giving EPA the authority to regulate
all nonroad engines, intended to create an artificial barrier between the engine and the equipment that houses it.
Therefore, if EPA determines in future rulemakings that the most effective way to control emissions from nonroad
engines is to regulate directly the nonroad equipment housing the engines, EPA shall do so using its authority under
the Clean Air Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations of today's action apply to all new nonroad CI engines at or above 37 kW with certain exemptions and exclusions.
Hereafter the engines included in this rule will be referred to as ``large nonroad CI engines.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The vast majority of large nonroad CI engines currently being used and manufactured are diesel-fueled engines. The
use of alternative fuels by nonroad engines will not be necessary to meet the emission standards. However, these regulations
apply to large nonroad CI engines regardless of the fuel that is used (for example, diesel, compressed natural gas
(CNG), rapeseed, methanol, ethanol, and blends). Provisions have been included which allow manufacturers to apply
for Administrator approval of alternative test procedures if fuel other than diesel is to be used.

In addition, EPA is prepared to propose and adopt additional standards for HC, CO, and PM emissions for engines from
37 kW to less than 130 kW consistent with those to be adopted by the European Community (EEC) and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE) as soon as these groups finalize their requirements for HC, CO, and PM emissions. The European
standards are currently projected to be as follows:

Note that the adopted CO standard for engines at or above 130 kW may be changed from 11.5 g/kW-hr to 5.0 g/kW-hr when the
European rules are final. This would ensure consistency between EPA and the more stringent European standard. This
is also compatible with California since engines certified to the lower European CO standard would clearly be below

EPA is adopting the engine family definition as proposed. EPA had expressed some concern in its proposal that, should
it adopt HC, CO and PM emission standards in the final rule, it was uncertain whether manufacturers should be allowed
to include engines with different numbers of cylinders or cylinder orientations in the same engine family. EPA argued
that it was uncertain whether deterioration of HC, CO and PM emission performance would proceed at different rates
in-use for engines with different numbers of cylinders. One commenter expressed a strong desire to be able to consolidate
engine families as much as practicable. The commenter also reminded EPA of the substantial enforcement liability
program in this rule that would provide adequate incentive to ensure a manufacturer makes reasonable use of the engine
family flexibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is aware that additional built-in safeguards such as the manufacturers' burden to define engine families
in such a way as to ensure all engine configurations have similar emission characteristics, and the manufacturers'
recall liability if all engine configurations are not as durable as expected. The Agency has no additional data at
this time to address its original concern. However, the Agency does believe that the enforcement provisions in this
rule will provide incentive to manufacturers to ensure that their engines are properly grouped so that they can be
appropriately represented by the selected test engines.

For PM emission measurement, EPA is adopting the California test procedures finalized in Sections 2420&hyph;2427,
Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-duty Off-road
Diesel Cycle Engines,'' as amended by California Air Resources Board Resolution 92&hyph;2, described in CARB mailout

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of engines that are not able to operate properly over the 8-mode or smoke test cycles (such as engines
with constant speed governors) may petition the Administrator prior to certification to allow use of an alternative
test procedure. Upon adequate demonstration of need, the Administrator may allow use of alternative procedures.
If an engine is unable to be operated over the smoke test procedure, the manufacturer must submit an alternative test
plan to the Administrator for approval in advance of any testing performed for certification purposes. Use of alternative
test procedures to demonstrate exhaust emission compliance is discussed in Section VI.H.

3. Certification Test Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting the certification test fuel specifications as proposed. This is because the most common diesel fuel
available to nonroad engines will have a higher sulfur content than that required for highway CI engines. Furthermore,
to ensure that no commercially available fuel is inadvertently excluded by this rule, EPA has broadened the band of
fuel sulfur content to include all fuels ranging from greater than .05 percent to .5 percent fuel sulfur. However,
as a provision of harmonizing with California emission standards, and explained below, EPA will allow engine manufacturers
the option to use test fuel specified by California, which contains lower sulfur content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California's particulate standard is predicated on the use of low sulfur fuel, which is the State-wide fuel standard
for both nonroad and highway engines. Therefore, the particulate standard EPA is adopting is likewise predicated
on the use of low sulfur fuel. However, EPA cannot require testing on a fuel that is not widely available. To compensate
for the effect of sulfur on particulate emissions, EPA is permitting two options for demonstrating compliance with
those standards. First, EPA will allow testing on the low sulfur California-specified test fuel for compliance with
all emission standards because sulfur content does not impact HC, CO or NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. Second, when testing is conducted with the higher sulfur federal certification fuel, the particulate
measurement may be adjusted by using the following equation to reflect the effects of higher sulfur content of the
fuel on particulate emissions:

Should European requirements be finalized using a different fuel sulfur level but maintaining the same PM emission

 and smoke standards. EPA may select either fuel, without constraints, for confirmatory or other compliance testing
for all of the standards, except particulate. For particulate testing, EPA's options are constrained somewhat by
the manufacturer's choice of test fuel. If a manufacturer chooses to test using low sulfur California test fuel, EPA
would not use higher sulfur, with the associated adjustment factor, for official enforcement of the particulate
standard. However, if a manufacturer chooses to test using the higher sulfur fuel, EPA will presume the manufacturer
accepts the validity of the adjustment factor, in which case EPA could choose to do a particulate enforcement test
using either the higher sulfur fuel with adjustment or the low sulfur fuel without adjustment. This issue is discussed
further in section VI. I. below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM for this rulemaking, EPA is authorized under section 217 of the CAA to establish fees to recover
compliance program costs associated with sections 206 and 207. EPA will propose to establish fees for today's nonroad
compliance program at some future time, after associated costs are determined.

1. Prohibited Acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting provisions that will prohibit introducing engines into commerce in the U.S. which are not covered
by a certificate of conformity issued by EPA. Additionally it will be a prohibited act to use a regulated but uncertified
nonroad engine in nonroad vehicles or equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
With the exception of some revisions described below, the SEA program is being adopted as proposed. The large nonroad
CI engine SEA program is an emission compliance program for new production nonroad engines and is authorized by CAA
section 213. With this action EPA may issue a SEA test order for any engine family for which EPA has issued a certificate
of conformity.

3. Emission Defect Warranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting emission design and defect warranty requirements as proposed. Nonroad engine manufacturers will
be required to warrant emission related components for a period of five years or 3,000 hours from the date of purchase
by the ultimate purchaser. This warranty will help ensure the manufacturing of a durable emission system and will
require the manufacturer to cover all repairs and replacements involving emission related components, at no cost
to the ultimate purchaser, during the warranty period.

EPA is adopting as proposed prohibitions against tampering with nonroad engines. Nonroad tampering provisions
will help ensure that in-use engines remain in certified configurations and continue to comply with emission standards.
All persons, will be prohibited from removing or rendering inoperative any device or element of design installed
on or in a nonroad engine. The manufacturing, sale and installation of a part or component intended for use with a nonroad
engine, where a principal effect of the part or component is to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative a device or element
of design of the nonroad engine will also be prohibited.

EPA is implementing the proposed restrictions on the importation of nonconforming nonroad engines. Today's action
will permit independent commercial importers (ICIs) who hold valid certificates of conformity issued by EPA to import
nonconforming nonroad engines. Under this program, the ICI must certify the engine to applicable U.S. regulations
via the certification process before an engine is imported. ICIs will be responsible for assuring that subsequent
to importation, the nonroad engines are properly modified and/or tested to comply with EPA's emission and other requirements
over their useful lives. The ICIs will also be responsible for recalls, maintenance instructions, emission warranties,
engine emission labeling, and maintaining adequate records in the same manner as an engine manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action also provides certain exceptions to the restrictions on importing nonconforming nonroad engines.
These exceptions are similar to the existing regulations on importing nonconforming motor vehicles and motor vehicle
engines and include exemptions for repairs and alterations, testing, precertification, display, national security,
hardship, nonroad engines greater than 20 original production years old, and certain nonroad engines proven to be
identical, in all material respects, to their corresponding U.S. versions. These exceptions also include the exclusion
of nonconforming engines used solely for competition.

6. In-Use Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting the proposed regulations subjecting nonroad engine manufacturers to the requirements of section
207 of the CAA. Under the adopted regulations EPA has the authority to recall engines which do not comply with emission
standards in-use. As proposed, the in-use testing liability period will be up to seven years or 6,000 hours, which
ever occurs first. The actual repair period for which a manufacturer must remedy nonconformities would not be limited
by actual years or hours, thus any resulting recall will apply to all engines of the recall family, regardless of the
years or hours of an individual engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In-use compliance with emission standards will be determined based on test results using the same test procedure
as that used in certification. EPA is modeling its large nonroad CI engine recall program after section 207 of the CAA
and therefore the Administrator may require manufacturers to recall applicable engines if a substantial number
of properly maintained and used engines are found to be out of conformity with the regulations issued under section
213 of the CAA.

7. Defect Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting the proposed emission defect reporting regulations which require manufacturers to report to EPA
emission-related defects that affect a given class or category of engines. The emission defect reporting regulations
also specify procedural and reporting requirements for manufacturers that initiate voluntary emission recalls.

8. Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is adopting the proposed regulations which allow manufacturers and other persons, where appropriate, to request
exemptions from regulation for certain purposes. These purposes include testing, display, national security,
export, and for manufacturer-owned and precertification nonroad engines.

VI. Public Participation and Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA held a public hearing on June 25, 1993 at which testimony was given by 14 individuals, including representatives
from equipment and engine manufacturers and states. The public comment period was open until July 27, 1993. EPA received
over 80 written comments during this time. In addition, meetings were requested by two organizations and held during
the comment period. As mentioned previously, the public comment period was reopened from October 4, 1993 through
October 25, 1993. During this period, EPA received additional comments which were given further consideration in
developing the final rule. The discussion of major comments and EPA's responses are divided into general categories.
More detailed Agency responses to comments may be found in the ``Response to Comments'' document in the docket for
this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a related rule concerning preemption of state nonroad regulations was proposed at 56 FR 45866, September
6, 1991. A public hearing was conducted on September 20, 1991. Many industries presented comments through an association
or individually. Represented at the hearing and in written comments are the following: engine manufacturers; manufacturers
and dealers of various types of equipment including agricultural, construction, mining, utility, and lawn and garden;
manufacturers of emission controls; railroads; manufacturers of industrial trucks; the San Diego Country Air Pollution
Control District; and the State of California. EPA considered these comments in promulgating this final rule.

A. Conversion of Standards and Measures to Metric Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA's proposed regulation presented standards and measures in non-metric units, with metric units given parenthetically.
Comments were received requesting that, for purposes of harmonization with Europe, EPA present all standards and
measures in metric units, forgoing the non-metric units altogether. EPA has the authority to do so under the Metric
Conversion Act of 1975 and Executive Order of July 25, 1991. Therefore, EPA is adopting metric units in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the final rule, the metric power equivalents (kilowatts (kW)) given for horsepower units in two cases are different
from the proposed equivalents. The 131 kW category in the NPRM is now 130 kW, and the 559 kW category is now 560 kW. EPA
was requested to adopt the 130 and 560 kW categories because they are in harmony with categories currently being developed
by the European Community. An engine manufacturers' association stated that so doing would not include or exclude
any engines that would not otherwise have been included or excluded in EPA's proposed rule. EPA agrees that a one kW
change will not significantly affect the engine family implementation schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The units in the tables of standards and implementation dates in this preamble show the non-metric equivalents. The
regulatory language is exclusively metric.

B. Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. HC, CO, and PM Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA proposed NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 and smoke standards and did not propose standards for HC, CO, and PM. Since NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission was demonstrated in the draft Regulatory Support Document to be largely unaffected by transient operation,
EPA is confident that an emission standard based on the adopted steady-state 8-mode test procedures for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will result in a sizable in-use emission reduction. Likewise for smoke, the adopted on-highway smoke test procedures
have both transient and steady-state operating modes, giving EPA confidence that the necessary technologies will
be applied to meet the smoke standards which will result in actual in-use emission reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in its proposed rule, the Agency reasoned that sufficient data and analyses had not been generated to adequately
demonstrate that the 8-mode test procedures are representative of potential transient operation occurring in actual
use. Since HC, CO, and PM emissions typically increase during transient operation, the Agency was not confident that
standards for these three pollutants on the adopted steady-state 8-mode test procedures would result in real emission
reduction in actual use and, thus, proposed not to regulate them. However, EPA did request comment on the appropriateness
of adopting standards for these pollutants. In particular, EPA requested comment on whether it should adopt California's
standards for these pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local agencies, environmental groups, health agency officials, and engine industry representatives
all requested that standards for HC, CO, and PM be included in the rule. The industry argued that, while adequate data
may not have been generated to establish an emission reduction benefit of the additional standards, adoption of the
additional standards is critical to worldwide marketing strategies which require regulatory harmony between the
U.S. and foreign government entities. The industry commenters claim, in this context, that by harmonizing with the
California standards and the projected European standards presented in Section V.B., EPA would actually reduce
the cost to an engine manufacturer which would not be compelled to build a different version of its engine for U.S. consumption
than would be built for the rest of the world. Arguments were presented that in any case there would be no harm in regulating
these additional pollutant emissions and there might be some consequential emission control or at least a capping
effect on HC, CO, and PM emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is committed to providing regulatory harmonization when it can be done without compromising U.S. environmental
goals. Since HC, CO, and PM emissions are typically higher during transient operation, EPA maintains its position
that there is too much uncertainty about the ability of the existing steady state test procedures to accurately predict
those emissions from in-use nonroad engines. Therefore, EPA believes it is technically incorrect to claim emission
reduction benefits for HC, CO, and PM emissions as measured by the test procedure being adopted. However, at the same
time, EPA believes that adopting these standards will not compromise U.S. nationally uniform environmental goals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching the decision to regulate HC, CO, and PM, EPA had to consider any additional costs which might be imposed,
and queried the industry during the public comment period. Engine manufacturers responded that these additional
standards would not result in added cost, or that any added costs would be offset by the efficiency gained by having
harmonized standards. On the basis of these comments, EPA is concluding that adopting HC, CO, and PM standards will
not result in increased cost burden.

 compliance, where there are quantifiable environmental benefits to be gained. However, because HC, CO and PM standards
have been promulgated solely for harmonization with California and Europe (neither of which allow ABT), and because
the benefits for HC, CO, and PM are not similarly quantifiable, ABT is not appropriate for HC, CO, and PM. Moreover,
the burden to the Agency and to industry of tracking and enforcing ABT for HC, CO, and PM would defeat the Agency's intent
to minimize such burdens to the degree that the Agency would reconsider its decision to adopt those standards at all,
an option the Agency is not willing to choose.

2. Smoke Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questioned EPA's authority to regulate smoke emissions, stating that EPA did not demonstrate as required
in CAA section 213(a)(4) that smoke significantly contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger public health or welfare. EPA made a finding in the NPRM that smoke significantly contributes to air pollution,
based on smoke's impact on visibility. As evidence of smoke's significant contribution to air pollution, EPA specifically
cited in its draft Regulatory Support Document the agreement to reduce smoke from the Navajo Generating Station to
improve visibility in the Grand Canyon. EPA discussed in the NPRM why smoke may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
both public health and welfare. EPA stated that ``there are indications that visible smoke may have an adverse effect
on health'' (58 FR 28809, 28845). The particles that make up smoke, about 2.5 microns in diameter, are of a size that
reflects and refracts light. These particles are sufficiently small to be inhaled into the lower lung cavities, thus
posing a potential health threat to the inhaler. See, for example, volume 329 of the New England Journal of Medicine
(December 9, 1993, p. 1753) for a discussion of the association between particulate air pollution and mortality rates.
EPA also cited damage through soiling of urban buildings, homes, cars and other property. EPA has met the statutory
mandate of CAA section 213(a)(4) for smoke, and stands by its assessments presented in the NPRM and RSD for this rulemaking.
Hence, EPA is retaining the smoke standards as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Lower Emission Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmentalists and states requested that EPA commit to a second phase of emission standards for new large nonroad
CI engines on an ``aggressive'' timeline. They are satisfied with the level of the standard only on an interim basis
and want to quickly move to a more stringent standard. One commenter expressed concern that, without specifying a
deadline for promulgating a second phase of emission standards in this rule, manufacturers will be slow to cooperate
with EPA in developing the new test procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine manufacturers have asked for assurances that they will have from five to eight years of ``regulatory stability''
before more stringent standards are promulgated, in order to amortize their investment in the current standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that more stringent emission standards should not be promulgated until the existing test cycle has been
verified to be representative, or until a more representative test cycle has been developed. EPA is currently working
with engine manufacturers to evaluate actual in-use operating conditions and the test procedures adopted in this
rule. These data will be used to determine the necessary modifications to the test procedures to ensure that more stringent
emission standards in the future result in actual in-use emission reductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has every intention of moving forward to determine the most appropriate test procedures to use in future regulation
of the engines covered in this rule. EPA has found that coordination with industry on clearly technical projects such
as this is most beneficial since it allows the Agency to receive early input as procedures are being developed. Such
early feedback creates an atmosphere of consensus-building and allows the Agency to promulgate rules that are more
equitable, efficient and effective. At this point, however, EPA cannot make assurances that it will provide engine
manufacturers ``five to eight years of regulatory stability,'' and neither can it commit to promulgating more stringent
standards on an ``aggressive'' timeline.

D. Exemptions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Mining Congress and other commenters in the mining industry requested that surface mining equipment
be exempted from regulation since, according to the commenters, mining equipment operates well outside nonattainment
areas. One commenter within the mining industry suggested that regulation of mining equipment should be on a case-by-case
basis. In other words, if the mining equipment at a site is shown to contribute to ozone or CO nonattainment, the equipment
at that site should be subject to regulation. As an alternative, these commenters suggested horsepower cutoffs ranging
from 500 to 750 horsepower, above which nonroad equipment would be exempted from compliance. These commenters also
took exception to EPA's inclusion of mining equipment in the construction equipment category, stating that mining
equipment is larger and more specialized than construction equipment. Further, they stated that while construction
equipment may be used at a mine site, mining equipment is never used on a typical urban construction site. These commenters
also questioned EPA's application of the proposed regulations to mining equipment since emissions from such equipment
were not included in the analysis contained in the Nonroad Study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency sees no justifiable reason for exempting from regulation all mining equipment or mining equipment above
certain horsepower cutoffs. The Agency is obliged to regulate all classes or categories of new nonroad engines that
cause or contribute (without reference to significance) to ozone or CO pollution in more than one nonattainment area.
The Agency believes that such equipment, even if operating outside nonattainment areas, is capable of contributing
to ozone nonattainment and, therefore, the Agency cannot justify an exemption of mining equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding whether mining equipment is being inappropriately included in the construction equipment category,
the Agency believes that mining equipment should not be treated as a separate class of equipment. There is acknowledged
crossover of equipment used on construction and mining sites. For example, excavators, off-highway trucks, crushing
equipment, rubber tired loaders and dozers, and crawler tractors are types of equipment commonly used by both mining
and construction industries. While some equipment may currently be used only at mining sites, there is no way to predict
future equipment use with certainty. Given the high degree of similarity between construction equipment and equipment
used in mines, EPA believes that it is justified in treating equipment used in mining as a subcategory of construction
equipment. EPA is not required, in determining classes and categories of nonroad engines or vehicles, to subdivide
such engines into small subcategories of engines, each of which may have less of an impact on nonattainment than the
broader category in which they are included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, it should be noted that the American Mining Congress specifically stated in its comments in the recent EPA
rulemaking on preemption of state standards for nonroad engines and vehicles that surface mining equipment should
be considered ``construction equipment'' in the context of that rulemaking (EPA Docket No. A&hyph;91&hyph;18).
In addition, EPA held a meeting with the American Mining Congress on July 22, 1993, and asked for specific information
to support their request for exemption from the proposed regulations. Such information requests included specific
dollar figures for the technology needed to comply, a component level breakdown of costs, annual equipment sales
and horsepower ranges of mining equipment and other information specifically targeted toward the impacts of mining
equipment on ozone and CO nonattainment.

Commenters suggested the Agency use varying horsepower cutoffs above which nonroad engines should not be regulated.
The main rationale given by commenters was that the technology improvements and/or design changes to these larger
engines would be too costly. EPA has received very little data directly addressing the actual costs anticipated for
these changes, and no information was provided detailing the specific unique high cost technologies that these engines
would need, even after the specific request by EPA discussed above. As discussed in section VII, EPA agrees that the
cost of compliance for engines over 560 kW (750 horsepower) would be more than the average cost per engine estimated
in this rule. EPA uses the net present value of the retail price increase per engine reported in this rule to estimate
the cost of this regulation to society, not to predict the cost of any particular engine covered by this rule. While
the Agency did not do a cost breakout by engine size, EPA's assessment of the limited cost data submitted by one manufacturer
of engines greater than 560 kW suggests that the retail price of these larger engines could increase by approximately
$100 per 75 kW due to this regulation. Therefore, in absolute terms, the cost is greater for larger engines. However,
in relative terms, the price increase for larger engines only represents about one percent of the total cost of the
equipment in which the engine is used. On average, this represents a slightly lower percentage price increase than
for smaller engines covered by this rule. EPA has determined that this level of increase for extremely high cost machinery
is reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received several comments stating that certain farm equipment, skid steer loaders in particular, should
be exempted from regulation because they do not significantly contribute to ozone nonattainment. As discussed above,
EPA is not required to make a significance determination for every category of nonroad engine it intends to regulate.
The significance determination applies only to the initial determination regarding emissions from all nonroad
engines and vehicles. Once that determination is made, the Agency shall promulgate regulations for all classes and
categories that contribute (without reference to significance) to nonattainment in more than one area. The Nonroad
Study clearly shows that farm equipment air pollution causes or contributes to nonattainment in several of the nonattainment
areas studied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to specific subcategories of farm equipment, EPA is not required to make determinations regarding every
subcategory of equipment that it intends to regulate. The Senate, in fact, instructed EPA not to disaggregate the
universe of nonroad engines into small subcategories.

E. Particulate Matter Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting by reference the PM test procedures adopted by California in Sections 2420&hyph;2427, Chapter 11,
title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road
Diesel Cycle Engines.'' California developed its test procedures by combining portions of the June 2 and June 30,
1992 versions of the test procedures being developed by the International Standards Organization as ISO&hyph;8178
test procedures recommended practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the PM test procedures to adopt in the final rule, EPA considered the need for harmonization and enforceability.
EPA determined that the California PM test procedures meet these two needs. First, this procedure ensures harmonization
with the State of California, allowing manufacturers to design one engine for both the California and federal markets.
The California procedures include the full range of the ISO&hyph;8178 recommended practices as published in June
1992, providing wide latitude for the conditions and methods used for PM measurement. EPA is not concerned with allowing
the engine manufacturers to use the full latitude of ISO&hyph;8178 for certification testing because, as previously
discussed, no PM emission reduction benefits are being claimed, and EPA has the ability to perform in-use compliance
testing over the entire range of the ISO&hyph;8178 procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is confident that its ability to perform compliance testing using any procedure within the boundaries of ISO&hyph;8178
will ensure that engine manufacturers use good judgment in selecting their specific PM test procedures. At the same
time, EPA recognizes the potential burden of liability for emission compliance over the entire range of conditions
specified in ISO&hyph;8178. This burden results from an engine manufacturer's responsibility to comply with emission
standards under any test conditions specified by the test procedures. Historically, when a range of test conditions
exist, manufacturers choose to test with the conditions which are worst-case for emissions performance. To the extent
that a manufacturer is unable to determine with certainty the worst-case conditions, it may be necessary to perform
a number of emission tests which bracket the range of test condition combinations within the ISO&hyph;8178 procedures
to ensure that the worst-case emissions are accounted for. Thus the burden to the manufacturer is increased testing
dictated by the level of risk that a particular engine family would fail EPA testing (compliance or in-use) due to an
unaccounted-for test condition specified in ISO&hyph;8178. However, EPA believes that the overriding concern
expressed in the comments for harmonization outweighs the potential burden of liability to comply with a broad test
procedure. Furthermore, the Agency does not have an alternative test procedure option that would ensure harmonization
at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is satisfied that the adopted PM test procedures are implementable and enforceable. The Agency is prepared to
review any proposals from the nonroad manufacturing industry to modify any portions of the PM test procedures that
would narrow the scope of test conditions while maintaining the integrity of the procedures. EPA is not prepared to
make its own proposal to tighten the test procedure specifications at this time as it might negatively impact harmonization
for an emittant for which EPA is claiming no emission benefit in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered adopting a modified version of its current on-highway engine test procedures for particulate contained
in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. This would address the flexibility issues regarding the ISO&hyph;8178 procedure, because
subpart N has tighter measurement tolerances and specific methodologies and procedures for emission measurement.
However, EPA did not have an effective means to address the various needs of the different manufacturers (that originally
led to the broad range of options in ISO&hyph;8178) in the time frame of this rule without adversely affecting some
manufacturers more than others. Additionally, this approach presented some risk that the test procedures developed
from EPA's current regulations would contain some elements not in harmony with California and Europe. Since EPA believes
the California PM test procedures will meet its needs and ensure harmony, development of its own procedures based
on subpart N was determined less desirable at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA considered, but rejected, adoption of the most recent United Nation draft version of ISO&hyph;8178.
This draft represents the most current development of these test procedures and is compatible with current European
plans. However, the United Nation's draft version of ISO&hyph;8178 must still go through a review process that could
result in a number of additional changes and will likely take one to two years before being adopted. If EPA adopted the
draft United Nations version, the Agency could eventually find itself to be in harmony with neither the California
version nor the final adopted European version of ISO&hyph;8178.

F. Smoke Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters requested that EPA revise the on-highway smoke procedures in 40 CFR 86, Subpart I, which were proposed
for this rule. The same revisions were requested under a separate EPA action that specifically focuses on technical
clarification on the subpart I procedures. Since part 89 regulations directly reference the part 86 subpart I procedures,
EPA will not consider these comments in this rule. Any revisions adopted under the separate EPA action of technical
amendments to part 86 subpart I procedures will likewise apply to engines certified under part 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers point out that this test was specifically designed for on-highway truck engines and is less applicable
to nonroad engine usage, but agree that this test is the best available at this time. In their comments, engine manufacturers
agreed to use the on-highway smoke test procedures until more representative and globally harmonized smoke test
procedures can be developed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is working closely with Europe and other government agencies as well as with voluntary standard-setting organizations
to develop new smoke test procedures. These procedures are not sufficiently developed at this time to reference or
adopt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is willing to use cooperatively developed and harmonized smoke test procedures that it determines meet its needs
to control in-use smoke emissions. A mechanism has been provided in this rule to allow the use of such procedures via
the alternative test procedures approval process. With this process, the manufacturer requests EPA approval to
use the alternative test procedures in advance of certification. EPA has authority to grant such a request if the procedures
are determined to be equivalent or better than the promulgated procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of a ``world-wide'' smoke procedure, EPA is confident the adopted procedures will reduce smoke emissions
and will ensure harmonization with California. California has pointed out it has modified its test procedures somewhat
by allowing the use of an in-line smokemeter. EPA has included provisions by which a manufacturer may use alternative
measuring equipment upon demonstration that it correlates with the current opacity meter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided not to allow use of the on-highway FTP for any aspect of nonroad engine certification. Based on data
received during the comment period and discussed in the Response to Comments document, the ability of the on-highway
test cycle to predict nonroad NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions for some types of engines is uncertain. In addition, even those commenters in support of the on-highway
FTP option stated that they would likely make minimal use of it. These reasons form the basis of EPA's decision not to
adopt this option.

H. Alternate Test Procedures for Constant Speed Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of engine manufacturers requested that EPA allow use of an alternate test procedure for engines that use constant
speed governors. These engines are typically used on applications such as generator sets that must be capable of holding
one precise speed during operation. Commenters have stated that these engines are not properly represented by, and
may not be capable of operating over, the 8-mode test procedures. Commenters recommended that EPA allow use of the
ISO 8178&hyph;D2 test procedures (2-mode) for constant speed engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has a mechanism in the regulations that would allow this request for alternate test procedures to be made with full
technical justification. Insufficient data were presented for EPA to determine the need and appropriateness of
adopting the specific ISO 8178&hyph;D2 test procedures for constant speed engines in this final rule. However, there
may be adequate technical justification for such an alternate test procedure. EPA has made available in the regulations
provisions by which an engine manufacturer may propose to the Administrator the use of an alternate test procedure
with adequate demonstration. This would be the appropriate mechanism for manufacturers of constant speed engines
should they determine that the 8-mode test procedures are unrepresentative for their engines.

I. Certification Test Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting test fuel requirements which allow an engine manufacturer to submit data either using a test fuel that
falls within the specification in the proposed regulations, modified to expand the fuel sulfur range to greater than
.05 percent to .5 percent fuel sulfur, or a lower sulfur test fuel that is consistent with the test fuel to be used in California.
EPA retains the right to perform confirmatory or in-use enforcement testing using either test fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA modified the fuel sulfur concentration range of its proposed test fuel based on concerns that the range specified
may inadvertently preclude the use of a fuel that could be available for use now or in the future. For example, the current
proposal in Europe specifies a test fuel with sulfur content ranging from .1 percent to .2 percent. Should the final
European requirements specify such a fuel in the future, EPA's proposal would not have allowed use of this fuel. As
this is not EPA's intent, the Agency chose to broaden the range of fuel sulfur content specified in Table 4 to Appendix
A of Subpart D in Part 89 of today's regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed that all nonroad engines be certified using test fuel with a sulfur content of 0.2 to 0.5 percent sulfur
by weight. EPA reasoned that although federal on-highway and California state-wide sulfur specifications will
be .03 to .05 percent sulfur by weight, some diesel fuel producers will continue to provide fuel with a higher sulfur
content for 49-state nonroad use. EPA believes some producers will decide not to incur the cost of purchasing and operating
hydrotreating equipment necessary for sulfur removal in the absence of a requirement to provide low sulfur fuel for
the federal nonroad segment of the market. Therefore, it is likely that the fuel available to the majority of nonroad
engines will be higher sulfur fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers requested to certify on low sulfur fuel because it will save them the cost of performing an extra test
(that is, one on high sulfur fuel for the federal rule and one on low sulfur fuel for California). They argued that because
the sulfur content of the fuel does not influence the production of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission and smoke, they should be allowed to use low sulfur fuel for certification testing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that using fuel specifications of commercially available fuel for certification testing is an important
demonstration of emission performance of in-use nonroad engines. EPA acknowledges that, in this case, the sulfur
content of the test fuel will not impact either NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or smoke emissions. However, EPA has agreed to adopt PM standards for the purposes of harmonization with California
and Europe. It is generally accepted that fuel sulfur has a noticeable impact on PM emissions. The impact of fuel sulfur
on PM, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoke emissions is discussed further in the Response to Comments document. Since fuel sulfur does have an impact
on PM emissions, PM emissions in the federal fleet will be higher in actual use than in the California fleet where the
only available fuel will have low sulfur content. While this rationale would argue against allowing use of low sulfur
certification fuel, at the same time, it is likely that the engines certified on low sulfur fuel will have no higher
PM emission in actual use than would have resulted had EPA promulgated only NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoke emission standards. Because harmonization, rather than emission benefits, is the driving factor behind
EPA's decision to impose the PM standard, EPA sees no need to increase the testing burden by requiring a different certification
fuel specification to demonstrate compliance with the PM standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, EPA will, at this time, allow engine manufacturers the option to use low sulfur test fuel as specified
in the regulatory language and consistent with California regulations. EPA may not continue to allow this option
in future regulations where emission benefits for PM reduction are claimed, unless EPA is satisfied that the low sulfur
test fuel is the fuel generally used by the regulated engines. Manufacturers using the higher sulfur test fuel may
normalize the PM emission results with the equation discussed in section V.D.3.

J. Certification Test Engine Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that the test engine selected to represent an engine family be a ``worst case emitter.'' This proposal
allowed each manufacturer to use its best technical judgment based on unique understanding of the specific engine
design it is certifying. The flexibility of such a methodology could result in the most cost effective and most accurate
selections, because the selection would be tailored to the specific engine family being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine manufacturers were not comfortable taking on the uncertainty of choosing their own ``worst case'' test engine,
pointing out that ``worst case'' is ambiguous. For example, what is worst case for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may not be worst case for smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware of this tendency for ``worst case'' to be emission specific. For that reason, in the past, the federal on-highway
rules and CARB's rule have specified that the engine selected for certification testing must be the one that injects
the most fuel per stroke of an injector at maximum power. This approach generally results in the selection of the least
efficient design within the engine family. While this approach is more prescriptive than the proposal, it generally
results in more consistency and is more likely to assure the selection of worst case for at least some of the emittants.
It gives manufacturers a more defined program and creates less administrative burden than the proposed method which
required manufacturers and EPA to make determinations and evaluations for each engine family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, EPA is adopting this more traditional engine selection criteria_most fuel per stroke
of an injector at maximum power_in the final rule.

K. Miscellaneous Certification Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Engine Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received requesting that EPA modify some of the proposed engine labeling requirements to be consistent
with California regulations. Some of the modifications requested were wording changes. Others involved deleting
or changing labeling requirements. EPA's response to these requests is included in the Response to Comments document.
One request for a modification had the potential for a more significant impact on industry. This request was to add
a provision requiring ``supplemental labels'' to be installed by the equipment manufacturer should the original
engine label be obscured after engine installation. EPA believes this provision would impose an additional burden
on the equipment manufacturers (in the form of label costs and recordkeeping to ensure the correct label was placed
on the equipment) and that no significant benefit would be gained. Thus, EPA is not requiring the use of supplemental
labels, but will not prohibit equipment manufacturers from using such labels, provided the labels meet the labeling
requirements set forth in the regulation.

2. Requiring Yearly Certification, Accepting California and European Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received requesting that EPA not require yearly certification in cases where no changes to the engine
family were made. EPA is retaining this requirement. It believes that the burden imposed on manufacturers in cases
where no changes are made is minimal (no additional testing required and only the resubmission of paperwork from the
previous year), and that yearly certification ensures continuity and equitable treatment among manufacturers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter also requested that EPA accept certification by California or Europe in lieu of federal certification
for reasons of economy. EPA's on-highway certification program requires that every vehicle sold in the United States
be covered by a federal certificate of conformity. On-highway manufacturers are permitted to ``carry across'' emission
data from testing performed to demonstrate compliance with California regulations to satisfy federal requirements.
This is possible because the test procedures are identical. For the nonroad certification program, EPA envisions
that similar certification and carryover/carry across policies will be in effect, which will allow manufacturers
to use the test data from a test performed for European or California certification to satisfy federal requirements
as long as the manufacturer provides evidence that the procedures used comply with the federal regulations. It is
EPA's responsibility to assure compliance with federal regulations. Manufacturers should be assured, however,
that the consistency and quality of the California certification program is such that engine families certified
by California will very likely receive federal certification. At this time, European regulations are not final,
so EPA cannot yet officially harmonize its requirements with Europe. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its proposal to
require an annual federal certificate for each engine family.

3. Technical Certification Test Procedure Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were provided on subparts D and E of the regulatory language, dealing with certification test equipment
and test procedures. In some cases, the comments were corrections of typographical errors or inconsistencies within
the regulatory language. In other cases, EPA was requested to modify technical aspects of its proposed procedure.
EPA adopted some, but not all of, the requested changes. These are discussed in the Response to Comments Document.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Implementation Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting the implementation schedule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental and state organizations commented that EPA should shorten the total implementation period, stating
that staggering implementation up to the year 2000 would delay important emissions benefits. On the other hand, engine
manufacturers asked for one to two years additional time, citing costs and facility constraints. Equipment manufacturers
also asked for one year to eighteen months to implement necessary equipment changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing state and environmental concerns, EPA considered a number of factors in its phase-in schedule determination.
First, the category of engines to be regulated in 1996 represents about 30 percent of the total population. This first
group includes engines similar to existing on-highway engines which can directly utilize the on-highway emission
control strategies and will produce a substantial early benefit. The other three categories of engines belong to
a manufacturing segment of the nonroad industry that has, for the most part, not previously been subject to EPA emission
standards. Manufacturers of these categories of engines have neither the facilities in place to collect required
information nor staff with experience in the certification process. Further, the phase-in schedule was designed
to allow time for the technical development which will be needed for the category of smaller-sized engines to comply
with the standards. Finally, over 95 percent of the total engine population to be regulated will be in compliance by
the 1998 model year. The final category (in the year 2000, engines at or above 560 kW) represents a small percentage
of the yearly sales population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that engine and equipment manufacturers have been provided enough flexibility in this rule (through
such features as ABT for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and staggered schedules) to allow enough lead time for them to make any necessary changes or modifications by the implementation
date. Engine manufacturers have stated that they intend to use the flexibilities of this rule to minimize the impact
of these regulations on their equipment manufacturer customers. EPA designed the phase-in schedule so that smaller
engines, which will be more difficult to control to the adopted NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard, and equipment using these engines, which may require the most modification due to tighter packaging constraints,
have an additional one to two years for development before regulation. Furthermore, early banking allows manufacturers
to selectively forego modifying specific models by collecting credits one year in advance of implementation from
engines that have been made to comply with the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards before the implementation date of the standard. Finally, ABT provides to manufacturers of that small percentage
of engines requiring extensive modification the ongoing option to avoid situations where high cost or tight time
constraints make modifications unreasonable. Therefore, EPA is retaining the implementation schedule as proposed.
No additional time is being granted to engine, vehicle or equipment manufacturers. However, EPA will allow vehicle
and equipment manufacturers a reasonable amount of time after the implementation dates for the different engine
categories so that the equipment and vehicle manufacturers can clear their inventory of unregulated engines.

M. In-use Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed an in-use recall program which included testing of in-use engines. EPA believes that a critical element
in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines that continue to meet emission
standards beyond the certification and production stages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the adopted regulations, EPA has the authority to recall engines which do not comply with emission standards
in-use. As proposed, the in-use testing liability period will be up to seven years or 6,000 hours, whichever occurs
first. This represents 70 to 75 percent of the nonroad engine average expected useful life. The repair period for which
a manufacturer must remedy nonconformities would not be limited by actual years or hours; thus any resulting recall
may be required to be applied to all engines of the recall family, regardless of the years or hours of an individual engine.
In-use compliance with emission standards will be determined based on test results using the same test procedure
as that used in certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern that EPA's recall program carefully select in-use engines which have been properly
maintained and used and that are representative of engines in-use. EPA acknowledges the concern of this commenter.
The Agency conducts its on-highway recall program with careful attention to compliance with the requirements of
the CAA concerning proper maintenance and use, and will continue to do so for the nonroad program, although differences
between uses for on-highway and nonroad equipment may require certain deviations from the on-highway program. EPA
is modeling its large nonroad CI engine recall program after section 207 of the CAA and therefore the Administrator
may require manufacturers to recall applicable engines if a substantial number of properly maintained and used engines
are found to be out of conformity with the regulations issued under section 213 of the CAA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recall regulations adopted today provide procedures and requirements for manufacturers of engines for which
a determination of nonconformity has been made. Such requirements include notification to be sent to engine owners,
the manufacturer's remedial plan and EPA approval of the plan, and procedures to be followed in the event that the manufacturer
requests a public hearing to contest the Administrator's finding of nonconformity.

N. Useful Life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting the definition of useful life as proposed with additional conditions. The useful life of engines covered
by this rule is ten years or 8,000 hours, whichever comes first. Further, the useful life ends when the engine is scrapped
or rebuilt. EPA is adding a provision allowing the manufacturer to apply to the Administrator for a shorter useful
life period for engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment or that are designed specifically
for lower useful life hours to match equipment life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine useful life defines the period of time a manufacturer is liable for the emissions that the engine emits. In-use
surveillance emission testing may be conducted at any time by EPA to determine if an engine family, after some time
in use, is still meeting emission standards. EPA is adopting an in-use testing and recall program based on testing
for a period of seven years or 6,000 hours, representing 70 to 75 percent of the average expected useful life for nonroad
engines. Therefore, while the manufacturer's liability for its engines covers the full useful life, evaluation
of an engine family's in-use compliance will be based on those engines within the engine family that have attained
70 to 75 percent or less of their expected useful life. This not only allows EPA to find more properly maintained and
used engines, but also allows for variation in the durability of different engine configurations within the same
engine family without selecting engines that are at the end of their useful life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While generally agreeing with the ten year/8,000 hour useful life for most engines, manufacturers expressed their
concern that some engine families are expected to have a useful life less than 8,000 hours. These engines are designed
to be used in severe conditions, often in seasonal equipment, or equipment with a short useful life. Manufacturers
are concerned that, should all engines be assumed to last for 8,000 hours, in-use testing of these severe application
engines at 6,000 hours (that is, 75 percent of the useful life) would unfairly penalize severe application engines
that could in fact be outside of their designed shorter useful life. EPA understands that such a situation could exist,
and thus is providing means for the manufacturer to petition the Administrator for an alternative useful life as stated
previously. Solid engineering data should accompany the request so that a reliable engineering judgment can be made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested that EPA adopt a shorter useful life period for engine families with individual cylinder
displacement below a specified volume. It appears that this suggestion was intended to provide a straightforward
method to administer useful life at the time of certification. However, EPA is not aware of a supportable technical
rationale that would suggest there is correlation between cylinder volume and useful life, or that engines with smaller
cylinder volumes wear out faster than engines with larger cylinder volumes. Smaller engines are also installed in
smaller equipment and the relative work expectation is no greater than larger engines in larger equipment. Most engines
covered by this rule are built to operate at full load/rated speed most of the time. Therefore, in relative terms, engines
are generally equally stressed during their lifetime regardless of their size or power. For these reasons, EPA does
not believe it is appropriate to define a shorter useful life for all engines under a specified cylinder volume. EPA
has provided a means for a manufacturer to provide evidence that would allow severe service engines to be held to a shorter
useful life.

EPA proposed to exclude engines used to propel locomotives from this rulemaking, as regulation of such engines is
being undertaken separately. EPA did not, however, exclude other engines operated on locomotives from this rulemaking.
EPA requested comment as to whether such other engines (``auxiliary engines'') should be regulated in this or the
later locomotives action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received several comments on this issue. The commenters all noted that auxiliary engines are appropriately regulated
under section 213(a)(5) as ``engines used in locomotives.'' EPA agrees with this determination and is promulgating
a definition of ``engines used in locomotives'' that corresponds to this determination. While there was general
agreement with the regulatory authority under which auxiliary engines used on locomotives can be regulated, comments
were received both agreeing and disagreeing with EPA's proposal that the auxiliary engines should be regulated in
today's rulemaking action. EPA believes that the statutory mandate of section 213(a)(5) allows EPA to regulate auxiliary
engines in this rulemaking. Moreover, the standard under which such engines are to be regulated is virtually identical
to the standard under section 213(a)(3). EPA also received comments indicating that auxiliary engines are similar
in design and performance to other nonroad engines regulated in this rulemaking, and that such engines should therefore
be regulated in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is including auxiliary large CI engines operated on locomotives in this rulemaking. This issue is
discussed further in the Response to Comments in the docket.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing the requirement that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers use certified
nonroad engines. EPA believes that the most effective way to ensure that certified engines are used in nonroad vehicles
and equipment is to require such engines to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA stated that CAA section 213 provides authority to require nonroad vehicle and equipment
manufacturers to use certified nonroad engines. However, EPA did not propose such a requirement. Instead, EPA requested
comment on how it might assure that only certified nonroad engines be used in nonroad vehicles and equipment. EPA received
comments on this issue from a State and an environmental association. Both comments requested that nonroad vehicle
and equipment manufacturers be required to use certified nonroad engines. One comment agreed that EPA has authority
under CAA section 213 to establish such a requirement, and the other pointed out that the entire program would be undercut
without such a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the October 4, 1993 notice, EPA proposed requiring nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers
to use certified nonroad engines. EPA received 12 comments on this issue, from six companies, four industry associations,
one State, and one environmental association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters opposed the establishment of this requirement. One company argued that failure to require use of certified
engines would not undercut the program because engine inventories are already kept to a minimum as their purchase
is a significant investment. An association argued that without a technical support document and regulatory language,
it could not comment meaningfully. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that industry inventory control practices can take the place of a requirement that certified nonroad
engines be used in nonroad vehicles and equipment. Without a requirement that certified engines be used, nonroad
vehicle and equipment manufacturers would be free to use uncertified engines, thus undermining the environmental
and public health benefits of the nonroad large CI engine emission reduction program. EPA is not requiring vehicle
or equipment manufacturers to be responsible for certification or performance of nonroad engines; that is the responsibility
of the engine manufacturer. The final regulations merely prohibit nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers
from using uncertified nonroad engines in their nonroad vehicles and equipment. Violation of this prohibition would
be a violation of CAA section 203(a), and would subject nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers to sanctions
under sections 204 and 205. EPA does not agree that the October 4, 1993 notice was so lacking in specificity as to require
reproposal. In fact, this prohibition was clearly discussed in the October 4 notice. EPA does not find regulatory
language regarding prohibited acts to have been required in the October 4 notice because such language would have
only restated the requirement that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers must use certified nonroad engines.
That requirement was clearly spelled out in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters agreed with the requirement. Of the two companies that supported the requirement, one stated
that the responsibility of vehicle and equipment manufacturers should be limited to assuring that engines have emission
compliance labels, and that engine manufacturers should be responsible for certification, testing, audits, warranty,
and recall. A State that supported the requirement said it is the only way to ensure that certified engines are used.
An environmental association said the requirement should improve the enforceability of the rule. EPA agrees with
these comments. The nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturer is responsible only for assuring that certified
engines are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters neither agreed nor disagreed with the requirement but raised questions regarding it. Several
commenters asked about the use of noncertified engines built prior to the implementation dates of this regulation.
Several commenters requested implementation dates for vehicles and equipment, to provide sufficient lead time
for engine manufacturers to produce certified engines for vehicle and equipment manufacturers to use. Two commenters
stated that an implementation date for engine manufacturers was sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not establishing separate implementation dates for nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers. However,
EPA recognizes that certified engines are not likely to be available in the numbers needed by nonroad vehicle and equipment
manufacturers on the implementation date, and that vehicle and equipment manufacturers will continue to use noncertified
engines built prior to the implementation date until noncertified engine inventories are used up and certified engines
are available. As long as vehicle and equipment manufacturers do not inventory engines outside of normal business
practices (that is, as long as they do not stockpile noncertified engines), vehicle and equipment manufacturers
will be considered to be in compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another question raised by several commenters regards products intended for export. Commenters asked whether engine
manufacturers can continue to produce noncertified engines for export, and whether noncertified engines may be
imported for use in nonroad vehicles and equipment intended for export. One commenter requested an exemption from
liability for engine and equipment manufacturers if nonroad vehicles or equipment sold for export are used in the
U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation does not prohibit import of noncertified engines for use in nonroad vehicles and equipment intended
for export. As originally proposed, the exemption for repair and alteration in 40 CFR 89.611&hyph;96(b)(1) will
allow the import under bond of noncertified engines for use in vehicles and equipment intended for export. Further,
this regulation does not prohibit the manufacture of noncertified engines intended for export. Manufacture of noncertified
engines intended for export is allowed under the conditions specified in 40 CFR 89.909&hyph;96(a), as originally
proposed. EPA is not providing a blanket exemption from liability for nonroad manufacturers whose products, intended
for export, are used in the U.S. Such manufacturers may, in fact, be liable for sanctions. Each case must be determined
on its own merits.

Q. Alternative Fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency proposed that the use of alternative fuels would not be necessary to comply with the emission standards,
but allowed any manufacturer wanting to use alternative fuels to petition the Administrator for approval of alternative
test procedures appropriate for that fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters addressed alternative fuels. One argued that alternative-fueled CI engines should be exempt from
regulation because of increased costs and increased competition with non-CI alternative-fueled engines. The other
commenter stated that EPA should include all natural gas engines in this regulation, establish better test procedures
as soon as possible, and allow these engines to certify to the same standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will adopt as proposed its provisions to include alternative fuel CI engines. No data were provided to support
any of the statements made by commenters. EPA still believes that including alternative fuel engines is appropriate.
Any additional cost for these engines to certify is small and comparable to that of diesel fueled engines. EPA reserves
the right to adjust standards when necessary, such as adjusting the HC standard to its non-methane equivalent, for
certain alternative fuels.

R. Selective Enforcement Auditing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a number of comments on its proposed Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program for large nonroad
CI engines. The proposed nonroad SEA program was designed to be similar to the existing on-highway program for heavy-duty
motor vehicle engines, with some modifications to accommodate differences between the two industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments indicate that industry understands EPA's need for the SEA program, but concern was expressed regarding
EPA's proposed changes from the on-highway program to adapt to the large nonroad CI engine industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to determine annual limits for the number of SEAs a manufacturer would receive. Each passing audit counts
as one toward a manufacturer's annual limit. EPA's on-highway light-duty vehicle (LDV), light-duty truck (LDT)
and heavy-duty engine (HDE) programs determine annual limits by dividing a manufacturer's projected annual production
by 300,000 for LDV and LDT manufacturers and 30,000 for HDE manufacturers, then rounding to the nearest whole number.
If the calculated production factor is less than one, the figure is set at one for that manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To compensate for differences between the on-highway and nonroad industries, EPA proposed that nonroad engine manufacturers'
annual limits would be determined by first calculating two annual limit factors, the production factor and the family
factor. These factors respectively represent the maximum number of audits based on yearly annual sales and on the
number of engine families produced in that model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production factor was derived from the annual limits currently used in the on-highway SEA programs and the relative
contributions of emissions from on-highway and nonroad sources. EPA proposed that the production factor should
be the projected annual nonroad engine sales of each manufacturer divided by 9,500 and rounded to the nearest whole
number. If the calculated production factor is less than one, the figure is set at one for that manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The family factor was proposed as an alternative method to compensate for situations where manufacturers may have
low production but a large number of engine families. EPA proposed that the family factor would be determined by dividing
the number of engine families certified by the manufacturer in a given model year by five and rounding to the nearest
whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to use whichever value is higher of either the production factor or the family factor as the annual limit
of SEAs for a manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers commented that EPA was putting a larger SEA burden on nonroad manufacturers than on on-highway manufacturers.
They recommended eliminating the family factor and that annual limits be determined, as in the on-highway HDE SEA
program, by dividing by 30,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual limits were also discussed at the public hearing for this rule on June 30, 1993. At that time EPA expressed concern
that if a manufacturer were assigned an annual limit of one, and that manufacturer passed an SEA early in the model year,
the incentive to maintain close control over emissions may decrease or the desire to establish very low emission limits
to maximize credits in an averaging program might increase the risk of noncompliance. Similarly, the manufacturer
could modify its production to increase emissions with the knowledge that no more SEAs would likely be assigned during
that model year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided to revise its proposed production factor method for determining annual limits. As commented upon,
EPA's proposed production factor analysis did not take into consideration projected emission reductions for large
nonroad CI engines. EPA estimated that the emission contribution for large nonroad CI engines is approximately half
of the contribution for on-highway sources. However, EPA estimates that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from nonroad engines will decrease by approximately 37 percent by the year 2025 or when a complete fleet
turnover occurs. Therefore, EPA reevaluated its production factor analysis and determined that the production
factor divisor should be 16,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to retain the family factor method for determining annual limits. This method was proposed to help
compensate for the expected low annual production per engine family and for the possible multitude of engine families
with relatively few SEAs per manufacturer to check compliance. EPA estimates that the average annual production
per engine family for large nonroad CI engines, even with the expanded engine family definition, will be less than
one tenth and less than one twentieth the average production of on-highway HDE and combined LDV/LDT engine families
respectively. Consequently, EPA believes the family factor in combination with the production factor is necessary
to assign annual limits to large nonroad CI engine manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the on-highway program, a goal of the nonroad SEA program is to encourage manufacturers to perform self-auditing.
Some manufacturers commented that EPA should develop specific guidelines for counting self-auditing against manufacturers'
annual limits. Additionally, it was suggested that EPA should count audits conducted by CARB toward annual limits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes the time, effort and cost manufacturers expend on self-audit testing and considers the quality, scope
and effectiveness of such programs when assigning audits to a manufacturer. However, EPA's on-highway HDE SEA program
has had audit failures even when a manufacturer's self-auditing showed that engines were in compliance with standards.
Consequently, EPA believes that spot checks of manufacturer's self-audit programs by SEAs are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria governing the assignment of audits are too numerous and interconnected to make specific guidelines
relating self-auditing to annual limits useful. For instance, a manufacturer with a comprehensive self-audit program
who is reluctant to remedy deficiencies and fails SEAs warrants continued attention by EPA just as a manufacturer
with a minimal program is likely to receive few SEAs if it routinely designs and produces engines well below emission
standards. Likewise, manufacturers who set unusually low FELs in averaging programs will be subject to extra scrutiny.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantial consideration will be given to assembly line testing required by CARB on engine families sold nationwide
when the CARB test protocols (for example, sampling plan) are as stringent as EPA's. While EPA will not reduce its annual
limits based on CARB audits, it will work together with CARB to exchange emission test data and consequently more efficiently
assess compliance with applicable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers will be notified of SEAs by means of a test order. EPA proposed that the test order would specify the engine
family to be audited, or EPA could specify an engine configuration or range of configurations from a family to be audited.
Manufacturers commented that, by auditing engine families, EPA could be significantly increasing the SEA burden
on manufacturers. However, as indicated in the NPRM, EPA planned to consider requests by manufacturers to exclude
particular engines or configurations from test samples for reasons such as urgent customer orders or to minimize
test cell set-up time. EPA still plans to consider those requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed that imported engines could be selected at ports of entry or storage locations in the U.S. SEA engines
are typically selected from the point of final engine assembly or from a storage or shipping facility. Manufacturers
commented that selecting foreign-produced engines at ports should be an option but not a requirement. Comments also
indicated that port selections could significantly increase the manufacturers' SEA costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as indicated in the NPRM, manufacturers could designate selection locations to minimize disruption and
shipping costs. EPA would not likely select engines for SEAs that are only imported installed in equipment; instead,
SEAs of those engines would usually occur during foreign trips by SEA staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total number of engines tested in an SEA will be dictated by the number of engines required to reach the statistically
acceptable pass/fail decision within the sampling plan applied. As in the on-highway program, these sampling plans
were designed to meet a 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to use the same sampling plans used for the on-highway HDE SEA program with two revisions. The proposed
revisions were to include a sampling plan (Plan AA) for lower production engines and to permit the use of the on-highway
sampling plan A on families with projected production between 20 and 99 engines. Plan AA was proposed as an option for
families with projected annual production between 20 and 50 engines and to permit an audit pass decision in as few as
three tests with a maximum of 20 tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers requested that EPA provide further flexibility in the use of sampling plans. It was requested that
EPA make each sampling plan available for manufacturers regardless of the audited engine's projected annual production.
It was also requested that EPA permit the use of CARB's low-volume sampling plan which permits a pass decision in as
few as two tests and has a maximum test sample of ten engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not adopting CARB's low-volume sampling plan for the SEA program. EPA believes this sampling plan's consumer
risk is too great to justify its use in a federal emission compliance program. However, EPA may consider requests by
manufacturers to terminate testing early during SEAs of low production families when the audit results are significantly
and consistently below each applicable standard or FEL, and selection of additional engines would be difficult or
cause a delay in shipment of customer-ordered engines, or the manufacturer's test facility does not have sufficient
capacity to expeditiously conclude the SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, failure of an SEA may result in suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that engine
family. To have the certificate reinstated subsequent to a suspension, or reissued subsequent to a revocation, the
manufacturer must demonstrate, by showing passing data that improvements, modifications, or replacement have
brought the family into compliance. The regulations include hearing provisions which allow the manufacturer to
challenge EPA's suspension or revocation decision based on application of the sampling plans or the manner in which
tests were conducted.

 standard while achieving a target level of environmental benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters supported the inclusion of ABT. Others opposed the program. One commenter believes that the program
would be overly complex, difficult to enforce, and would decrease the effectiveness of the standard by increasing
the overall emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. The target level of environmental benefits was proposed with ABT in mind. In EPA's opinion, and as discussed
in the NPRM, the flexibilities afforded by ABT are appropriate to achieve the 9.2 g/kW-hr NO

2. Participation of California-certified Engines in ABT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that engines sold in California and subject to California emissions standards would not be included
in the federal ABT program. EPA also proposed that engines sold in California but preempted from California regulation
or not subject to California emission standards (primarily construction and farm equipment below 130 kW (175 hp))
be eligible to participate in ABT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter preferred to have a 50-state credit exchange program which would include all engines shipped to all
50 states regardless of the state regulations. Other commenters believed that the engines subject to state regulations
should be excluded from participation in the program. Also, one commenter preferred that all engines sent to California
not be included in the federal ABT program and recommended the compromise of having a California-only averaging set.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that to maintain the effectiveness of the separate California and national emission standards, any
engines both sold in California and subject to California regulations (or both subject to regulations and sold in
other states that adopt California's regulations under section 209(e)(2)(B)) should not be allowed to participate
in the federal ABT program. Although a 50-state scenario would reduce the tracking burden on manufacturers, reduced
tracking burden is not a sufficient reason in EPA's opinion to include California engines. Because California does
not allow ABT, all engines both sold in the California market and subject to California regulations will be at or below
the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard finalized by EPA today. Therefore, including these engines in the national average could cause the average
emissions of engines in the other 49 states to exceed the standard. Finally, engines sold in California but not subject
to California emission regulations are subject to federal regulations and, thus, may participate in ABT.

3. Power Ratings for Credit Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to calculate credits by taking the difference between the standard and the FEL, times the sales volume
of engines participating in the program, times the power rating. The power rating was proposed to be the largest power
rating within an engine family for those families using credits, and the smallest rating within an engine family for
families generating credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters claimed that the proposed method for determining the power rating for credit calculations translates
into a significant (greater than 50 percent) reduction in the number of credits generated and an increase in the number
of credits used. They recommended that families be divided into subfamilies, and the most environmentally-safe
power rating be drawn from each subfamily for credit calculations. An engine family would have to consist of a broad
range of power ratings to realize either a 50 percent reduction in credit generation or a 50 percent increase in credit
use. EPA stated in the NPRM that it would not allow multi-configuration engine families to be arbitrarily divided
into multiple engine families to maximize credit generation or minimize credit usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in those specific cases where such a broad range of power ratings occur in one family, a manufacturer would
likely be able to demonstrate, consistent with &sect;89.116&hyph;96(d) of the regulations, that the expected useful
life emission characteristics of some configurations within a broad engine family warrant a separate engine family
designation. This would mitigate the credit reduction caused by extremely broad engine families while maintaining
EPA's intent that subcategories not be established for the sole purpose of maximizing credits.

4. Discounting of Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed ABT program did not include a discount on credits. The proposal did specify a first in, first out (FIFO)
accounting system for credits used in averaging (see &sect;89.204&hyph;96(b)); this effectively extends FIFO
to banking and trading because in order to ultimately use banked or traded credits, they must be averaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters approved of the absence of a discount on banked or traded credits. One commenter disapproved because
discounting, which is included in the on-highway heavy duty averaging program, is viewed as ensuring that a tangible
environmental benefit will accrue from a banking program. This commenter would prefer a reduction in available banked
credits through discounting or the use of a last in, first out (LIFO) accounting system to mitigate this effect over
time.

 The rationale for the credit discount was two-fold. First, additional environmental benefits were desired from
banking and trading over and above the benefits produced from the averaging program already in place when banking
and trading were added. Credit discounting was determined to be an appropriate method of providing a tangible environmental
benefit, so that both manufacturers and the public would share the benefits created by the addition of banking and
trading. Second, EPA believed that the amount of the discount would not be a disincentive toward participation in
the program. Although a credit discount may be appropriate for the on-highway heavy duty ABT program, where banking
and trading were promulgated separately from averaging, EPA is not promulgating a credit discount for today's action.
The level of environmental benefits, the level of the emission standard, and the banking and trading components of
the ABT program were determined in conjunction with one another. Therefore, a credit discount for today's action
is not necessary.

One commenter requested that if EPA was not requiring discounting, the Agency should require the use of LIFO as a means
to minimize the value of early banking and of banking in general. Under a FIFO accounting system, older banked credits
must be used in the current year's average before credits generated in the current year. This potentially allows manufacturers
to bank all the current year's credits, which will have a three year potential credit life, if manufacturers are able
to use previously-banked credits or purchased credits to offset those engines with FELs above the standard. This
encourages manufacturers to achieve more emissions reductions earlier, which may be beneficial for the environment.
Mandating a LIFO accounting system may discourage early emission reductions and was not proposed by the Agency.

5. Allowing Early Banking of Emission Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters supported EPA's proposal to allow manufacturers to bank credits one year in advance of the implementation
date in order to provide incentives to introduce clean technology a year early. One commenter suggested allowing
early banking starting in 1995 regardless of the phase-in implementation date. One commenter believed that early
banking should be excluded in order to prevent the generation of windfall credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that incentives should be provided for manufacturers to make early use of clean technology. This
consideration outweighs the Agency's concerns regarding the minimal number of credits that may be generated a year
in advance by the small percentage of engines which already meet the upcoming standard. EPA presented an analysis
in the NPRM demonstrating that credits from this small percentage of engines did not represent significant windfall
credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA supports early banking incentives for the introduction of clean technology, EPA does not support allowing
early banking starting in 1995 regardless of the phase-in implementation date. EPA proposed the phase-in implementation
dates because many manufacturers had informed EPA that additional leadtime is necessary for particular sizes of
engines. Although it would be beneficial to the environment to have clean engines introduced earlier, EPA is not allowing
early banking beyond one year because the larger number of engine families and the extended years of early banking
would increase the potential of windfall credits.

 emissions below 9.2 g/kW-hr and could generate credits up to the 9.2 g/kW-hr according to &sect;89.207&hyph;96 and
bank these credits for future use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the idea of early banking. However, several commenters disagreed on the credit generation
level. Some commenters recommended that, to create an incentive for manufacturers to meet the standards early, they
should be allowed to generate credits up to 11.9 g/kW-hr. Another commenter opposed the credit generation level of
11.9 g/kW-hr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it is inappropriate to establish a credit generation level above 9.2 g/kW-hr due to the possibility
of windfall credits. EPA did not receive data to indicate that emission credits granted to industry at the 11.9 g/kW-hr
level would be, overall, less than or equal to the environmental benefits gained by the early banking program. Therefore,
manufacturers participating in early banking may only generate credits up to 9.2 g/kW-hr.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has substantial experience in enforcement of vehicle and engine emissions from the on-highway ABT program. This
experience will be carried forward to the nonroad program. EPA will ensure that manufacturers are held responsible
for meeting the FELs that they set, that the FELs are carefully monitored by means of the SEA program, and that overall
compliance is effectively monitored. Further, manufacturers will not be allowed to use credits to remedy FEL exceedances
detected by EPA enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the connection between credit information and confidential sales information, EPA regulations concerning
the release of confidential business information have restricted the public's opportunity to review manufacturers'
submission of credit generation and usage. EPA is currently discussing with the participating manufacturers in
the on-highway ABT program the possibility of implementing a means of allowing the public to access enough information
to make general assessments about the effectiveness of the ABT program on a regular basis. The Engine Manufacturers
Association concurs that it is important to provide an ongoing opportunity for the public to evaluate the overall
progress of the program. EPA and EMA expect to finalize an agreement in the near future on the periodic release of credit
data in a format that would be useful to the public.

Defining the term nonroad equipment is a logical outgrowth of this rulemaking, is in keeping with the intent of Congress,
and clarifies EPA's use of the term. EPA also notes that the definition of the term ``nonroad vehicle'' has been revised
to match the statutory definition; instead of defining nonroad vehicles as vehicles propelled by nonroad engines,
they are defined as vehicles powered by nonroad engines.

U. Definition of New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the September 6, 1991 NPRM proposing regulations under section 209(e) of the CAA regarding preemption of state
nonroad regulations, EPA proposed a definition of ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle.'' In that NPRM,
EPA defined ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle'' to mean a nonroad engine or a nonroad vehicle the equitable
or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. EPA did not provide a definition of ``new''
in its May 17, 1993 NPRM because EPA expected that the definition of ``new'' promulgated in the context of the section
209(e) rulemaking would control how ``new'' would be defined in this rule. However, EPA has not yet promulgated its
section 209(e) regulations. Therefore, EPA is finalizing a definition of ``new'' in this rulemaking relying in part
on the definition proposed in the September 6, 1991 NPRM and the comments received in response to that NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimate purchaser was proposed to be defined as the first person who in good faith purchases such a new nonroad vehicle
or nonroad engine for purposes other than resale. Additionally, with respect to imported nonroad engines, EPA proposed
to define ``new'' nonroad engine to be a nonroad engine manufactured after the effective date of a regulation issued
under section 213 which would be applicable to such engine had it been manufactured for importation into the United
States. These definitions also applied to ``new locomotives'' and ``new engines used in locomotives.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on EPA's proposed definition of ``new'' were several. First, CARB, the San Diego Air Pollution Control Board
(SDAPCB), and the Manufacturers of Emissions Controls Association (MECA) supported EPA's definition. CARB asked
that EPA clarify which regulatory activities states may perform; for example, whether states may require in-use
testing and impose add-on or retrofit requirements. On the other hand, many commenters, including U.S. Representative
Terry Bruce, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI), the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the
Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association (PPEMA), opposed EPA's proposed definition and proposed that
``new'' should mean manufactured after either the effective date of the Clean Air Act Amendments, November 15, 1990,
or after federal regulations take effect. These commenters believe that Congress intended an ``absolute'' preemption.
That is, the nonroad engines and vehicles in the preempted categories manufactured after November 15, 1990 would
never be subject to any kind of state emission regulation. EMA commented that if EPA does not accept the latter definition,
it should expand its proposed definition so that engines remain ``new'' until they have exceeded their useful life.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters in the railroad industry also supported a definition of ``new'' as ``manufactured after November 1990''
and stated further that the railroad industry has traditionally been preempted from state regulation, such as in
the area of safety. The same commenters indicated that they believe that state control of locomotive emissions or
state enforcement of federal standards would interfere with interstate commerce. Railroad commenters also stated
that any standards for rebuilt or remanufactured engines or locomotives should be uniform federal standards_not
state standards. Furthermore, if remanufactured engines were rebuilt to comply with such federal standards, they
should be considered ``new''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also opposed the proposed definition regarding imported vehicles and engines because the definition
of ``new'' was different depending upon whether the nonroad engine was produced domestically or abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed definitions for ``new nonroad vehicles'' and ``new nonroad engines'' parallel the definitions of
``new motor vehicles'' and ``new motor vehicle engines'' in section 216 of the Clean Air Act. The definition of ``new''
proposed for imported nonroad engines was intended to address nonconforming engines which may become subject to
federal emission requirements at the time the engine or vehicle is imported into the United States. The Agency has
decided to delete this definition of ``new'' for imported engines. EPA agrees with the commenters that imports and
domestic products should generally be treated alike for regulatory purposes. Today's rule treats domestic and imported
nonroad engines the same way for purposes of determining whether they are new. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule establishes for the purpose of these federal regulations, a definition of ``new'' as it applies to
all domestically manufactured and imported ``new nonroad engines,'' ``new nonroad vehicles,'' and ``new nonroad
equipment.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment are defined as engines, vehicles, and equipment the equitable or legal
title to which has not been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. The ultimate purchaser is defined as the first person
who in good faith purchases such engine, vehicle, or equipment for purposes other than resale. For some engines, vehicles,
or equipment the passage of title in the United States may not formally occur or manufacturers may retain title and
lease the engines or equipment. In these cases, a domestic or imported nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad
equipment will retain its status as ``new'' until such engine or vehicle is ``placed into service.'' An engine, vehicle,
or equipment is considered ``placed into service'' when the engine, vehicle, or equipment is used for its functional
purposes. EPA believes that the definition of new should include the ``placed into service'' addition to the motor
vehicle definition of new found in section 216 of the Act because of the nature of the nonroad market. Nonroad engines,
nonroad vehicles and nonroad equipment are often leased and maintained by the manufacturer well into the useful life
of the nonroad equipment. A piece of equipment, the title of which has passed to the ultimate purchaser, should not
be treated differently than a piece of equipment which is being used but has not yet passed to an ultimate purchaser.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that this definition of ``new'' comports with the language, intent and structure of the Clean
Air Act and is a permissible construction of the statute. Contrary to the assertion of some commenters, EPA's definition
of ``new'' is consistent with the dictionary definition of the word as ``having existed or been made but a short time.''
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1990. Generally speaking, manufactured products are sold soon after
they are made and are considered new until they are sold or used. The commenters' definition of new_anything manufactured
after the Clean Air Act Amendments' enactment or an applicable regulation's promulgation_would mean, by contrast,
that any engine manufactured after a certain date would be new forever. This is certainly not the plain meaning of ``new.''
Congress could have stated that the federal preemption applied to certain equipment manufactured after a certain
date, but Congress did not do so. Elsewhere in title II, Congress specified that a provision only applied to products
manufactured after a certain date (see, section 218 requiring a ban on engines manufactured after the 1992 model year
that require leaded gasoline) or first introduced into commerce after a certain date (see, section 211(f) regarding
prohibition on fuels that are not substantially similar to fuels used to certify vehicles as meeting emission standards).
The lack of such a date here further supports that Congress intended ``new'' to mean newly manufactured and not yet
sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative record also shows Congressional intent that ``new'' should refer to newly manufactured products.
In his colloquy with Senator Wilson explaining the final version of section 209(e), Senator Chafee notes that ``because
the preemption is limited to new engine standards only, States can continue to require existing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and in-use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonroad engines to reduce emissions *&blank;*&blank;*'' [Emphasis added] 136 Cong. Rec. S17237 (October 26, 1990).
This language is echoed by similar language from Senator Baucus in his report to the Senate on the conference bill.
136 Cong. Rec. S16976 (October 27, 1990). If Congress intended the definition of new nonroad engines or equipment,
and as a result the preemption, to apply to an engine for its entire life, then it would appear that there would be no distinction
between new and in-use nonroad engines, as an engine manufactured after a certain date would always be new. Yet the
statements of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus clearly contemplate such a distinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with the way the Act approaches motor vehicle emission control.
As noted earlier, section 216 defines new in the context of motor vehicles as ``a motor vehicle the equitable or legal
title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.'' The Act applies federal emissions standards
to ``new'' vehicles. These federal standards are enforced through certification, assembly line, and recall testing.
States, on the other hand, have a role in motor vehicle emission control through inspection/maintenance programs
and are not restricted from controlling used vehicles. The section 209(a) prohibition of state regulation of motor
vehicles addresses only ``new'' motor vehicles and engines and prohibits state regulation that occurs before sale,
titling, or registration of the vehicle.

Section 209(a) provides, in part, ``.&blank;.&blank;. No State shall require certification, inspection, or any
other approval relating to the control of emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine as condition
precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if any), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 take a parallel approach to nonroad standards and enforcement. Section 213 provides
EPA with authority to set standards for ``new'' engines and provides for federal enforcement of such standards in
the same manner as motor vehicle enforcement. Furthermore, nothing on the face of section 209(e) or section 213 indicates
that Congress intended ``new'' to be interpreted differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle contexts.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Given that the preemption provisions for new motor vehicles and new nonroad engines appear in the same section of the
Clean Air Act, it is reasonable to believe that Congress did not intend for the word ``new'' to be defined differently
within the same section without stating this intent explicitly.

Much of the argument below discusses the definition of ``new'' as applied to section 209 of the statute. However, these
arguments are equally valid for the purposes of defining ``new'' under section 213, especially given the integrated
nature of Part A of Title II, the legislative and statutory history, and practical necessity. For example, consistent
definitions of new under sections 209 and 213 are likely to ensure that there are no unintended gaps in regulation or
unintended dual regulation. Also, the statutory definition of ``new motor vehicle'' and ``new motor vehicle engine''
are applicable equally to federal regulations and preemption of state regulations. EPA generally sees no logical
reason to treat nonroad engines differently. However, see the discussion in footnote 21.

EPA recognizes that regulation of locomotives presents unique circumstances, including questions regarding interstate
commerce, that require special attention. EPA therefore believes that the definition of ``new'' as used in ``new
locomotive'' and ``new engine used in a locomotive'' may need to be treated differently for the purposes of determining
preemption of state regulation under section 209(e) than it is treated for the purpose of federal regulation under
section 213(a). This issue will be addressed in a later rulemaking.

There is not a compelling policy or factual justification for defining new differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle
contexts. State regulation of nonroad engines does not generally present any greater degree of disruption of the
movement of products, engines or equipment between states than does regulation of motor vehicles. The comments provide
little if any justification, in terms of relevant distinctions between motor vehicles and nonroad engines, to justify
such a significant departure from EPA's established practice for regulating mobile sources.

 the court held that where the exercise of local police power serves the purpose of a federal act_the Clean Air Act in
that case_the preemptive effect of the act should be narrowly construed. In keeping with that principle, EPA believes
that the definition of ``new'' should be construed narrowly in order to protect states' rights, particularly in an
area such as public health in which states traditionally exercise control. California's nonroad regulations will
serve the purpose of the federal act by improving air quality.

EPA believes that the further a state requirement is removed in time from the manufacture and distribution of new engines,
the less interstate commerce is likely to be burdened. Furthermore, the legality of particular regulatory controls
that a state may impose on nonroad vehicles or engines that are no longer new will depend upon the burden that such controls

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allway Taxi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stated that a state or locality is not free to impose its own emission control measures the moment after a new car is bought
and registered. ``That would be an obvious circumvention of the Clean Air Act and would defeat the congressional purpose
of preventing obstruction to interstate commerce.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The court further stated that federal preemption does not, however, preclude a state from imposing its own exhaust
emission control standards upon the resale or reregistration of the automobile. Furthermore, states are not precluded
from setting standards for licensing of vehicles for commercial use. These types of regulations, which are more removed,
``would cause only minimal interference with interstate commerce, since they would be directed primarily to intrastate
activities and the burden of compliance would be on individual owners and in-state users and not on manufacturers
and distributors.''

 EPA believes that the requirements of section 209(e)(2) apply only to new nonroad engines and vehicles. The requirements
of section 209(e)(2) are only required for nonroad engines and vehicles the regulation of which has been preempted.
The language of section 209(e)(2) does not state any clear preemption, either for new or in use vehicles. The only clear
preemption of state regulation of nonroad engines occurs in section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a).

In-use testing and recall programs of the type set forth in section 207 ensure compliance with standards required
to be met by manufacturers at the time of certification of the engine. Because these in-use standards relate to the
original manufacture of the engine and place the burden of compliance upon the manufacturer, they are deemed to be
standards affecting a new motor vehicle or a new nonroad engine and thus require a waiver under the criteria of section
209(b) or 209(e)(2) respectively.

Section 209(a) applies to nonroad vehicles because of the language of section 213(d) of the Act, which specifically
requires that EPA's standards regulating nonroad engines and vehicles be subject to sections 206, 207, 208 and 209
of the Act, with such modifications of the applicable regulations as the Administrator deems appropriate. Thus,
Congress clearly anticipated that all of section 209 would be applicable to nonroad engines. Subsections (a) through
(d) of section 209 do not specifically reference nonroad engines, nor do sections 206, 207 or 208. However, the language
of section 213(d) clearly is intended to apply such provisions to nonroad engines. Further indication of Congress'
intent is the language of the last sentence of section 209(e)(1), which states that subsection 209(b) does not apply
for purposes of subsection (e)(1). (Section 209(b) provides the procedure under which California can receive a waiver
of section 209(a) preemption for motor vehicles.) This sentence would not have been necessary unless subsection
209(a) through (d) otherwise applied.

Another indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to most in-use regulations of nonroad engines
is the fact that neither the Senate nor the House version of the 1990 Act amendments would have preempted state regulation
of anything but new nonroad engines. Neither version would have expressly preempted regulation in use. It would be
unusual for a bill to come out of conference with a broader preemption than existed in either house and without any mention
in the legislative history that such broader preemption had been mandated. In fact, both Senators Chafee and Baucus
believed that the scope of the preemption had been narrowed from the House bill, not widened.

Both Senators declare that state preemption is limited to new locomotives and new small farm and construction equipment.
Both mention that states may still regulate other new nonroad equipment, presumably after receiving EPA approval.
Finally, each declare that states also fully retain existing authority to regulate emissions from all types of existing
or in-use nonroad engines by specifying fuel quality specifications, operational modes or characteristics or measures
that limit the use of nonroad engines or equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fact, as the legislative history indicates, it appears that Congress intended the preemption provisions of section
209, as applied to nonroad engines, to be analogous to the preemption provisions as applied to motor vehicles, except
that California cannot request any waiver of the Federal preemption of state regulation of new small farm and construction
equipment and locomotives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to in-use regulations is the fact that, if the
subsection were applied to in-use regulations, then California would be the only government (local, state or federal)
that could directly set regulations for nonroad engines in use. EPA's mandate under section 213 applies only to new
engines. Therefore, EPA will not promulgate standards for in-use regulation of nonroad engines under section 213,
beyond in-use regulations normally associated with new certified engines (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in-use testing and recall requirements under section 207). States other than California would not be able to regulate
nonroad engines in use (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 operation controls under section 209(d)) until California regulates them and could only regulate them in a manner
identical to California's regulations. Nothing in the legislative history indicates such a dramatic departure
from the current ability of states and local authorities to regulate emissions of mobile sources in use. Therefore,
if section 209(e)(2) is determined to apply to in-use regulations, the entire United States regulatory scheme for
regulation of nonroad engines in use would be dependent on the actions of one state, California. Congress could not
have meant to grant such plenary power to a single state.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is especially true given the location-specific nature of in-use regulations. In-use regulations, such as time
of use or place of use restrictions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 high occupancy vehicle lanes) are typically very site specific. An in-use regulation suitable for California, or
in part of California, may have little or no relevance or practicality to the type of in-use regulation suitable for
another area. Such regulations which primarily effect local users are more appropriately controlled and implemented
by local and state governments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, section 209(d) of the Act clearly limits the preemption of state regulation in use. It states that ``nothing
in this part shall preclude or deny to any other State or political subdivision thereof the right otherwise to control,
regulate, or restrict the use, operation or movement of registered or licensed motor vehicles.'' As was stated above,
section 209 as a whole applies equally to nonroad engines. Thus, section 209(d) should be interpreted to mean that,
unless state regulation of use of nonroad engines is specifically preempted, section 209 should not be interpreted
to grant any implicit preemption, except within the framework of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the language of section 209 and the lack of any express preemption, the legislative history of these provisions,
and the general presumption against providing broad preemption where such preemption is not made explicit, EPA believes
that it is clear that section 209(e)(2) does not apply to in use regulation of nonroad engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA recognizes the important principle of narrowly construing the preemptive effect of the Act as explained
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allway Taxi,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA also notes that certain state regulations that may be characterized as ``in-use'' regulations may be preempted
because they are effectively regulations on the design of new engines rather than on the use of ``in-use'' engines.
Industry has expressed concern that states might impose retrofit requirements on nonroad engines and vehicles as
soon as they are introduced into commerce, or when such engines are being rebuilt, or at a date after which nonroad engines
are typically rebuilt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA recognizes that CARB does not envision a retrofit requirement and that, because of the nature of the nonroad market,
it is unlikely that other states would adopt such a requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, given EPA's definition of new and the scope of the definition within this rulemaking, this issue could arise
when other states plan their in-use emission strategy. In such a case, EPA believes that a retrofit requirement mandating
a retrofit of a nonroad engine immediately after the engine is no longer new is adverse to the Congressional intent
of section 209(e) and the principles laid out in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allway Taxi.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, in this scenario, such a retrofit requirement would be deemed an in-use emission standard relating back
to the original design of the new engine by the original engine manufacturer (OEM) and would be subject to the waiver
criteria of section 209(e)(2). Within this same scenario, only California could adopt such a requirement and other
states could only adopt California's requirement if California subsequently was granted a waiver. However, after
a reasonable amount of time has passed and the engine is no longer new (most likely when an engine is being rebuilt),
modest retrofit requirements would most likely not be deemed to significantly affect the OEM and thus such requirements
would not be subject to subsection 209(e)(2). In this second scenario, the modest retrofit requirements would still
be subject to challenge in court under the

(

i.e,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 as of the date title passed, regardless of when the engine was produced, then an engine manufactured in 1990 but not
sold until 1994 would be subject to 1994 emission standards. This problem is avoided since California's Utility Engine
Rule ties the date of manufacture to the standard, therefore a 1990 engine would be subject to a 1990 standard and a 1994
engine subject to a 1994 standard.

Therefore, the Agency has determined that nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles will be ``new'' for purposes of the
Act until the equitable or legal title passes to the ultimate purchaser, or if title passage does not occur, then the
engine or vehicle will be new until placed into service.

V. Definition of Locomotive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The September 6, 1991 NPRM to the California nonroad preemption regulation defined locomotive as a self-propelled
piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized
maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment or carrying freight or
passenger traffic or both. As with the definition of ``new,'' EPA did not propose a definition of locomotive in its
May 17th NPRM, but is finalizing a definition is this rulemaking, relying in part on the definition proposed in the
September 6, 1991 NPRM and the comments received in response to that NPRM. The

EMA noted a difference between the NPRM definition and the definition given in the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA)
upon which the EPA definition was based, but did not recommend EPA use the LIA definition in the definition EMA provided.
The only difference between the EPA definition and the LIA definition is that the LIA definition of locomotive includes
a piece of equipment without propelling motors but with one or more control stands. This item was not included by EPA
since if it has no propelling motors it will not be of concern for purposes of engine emissions regulations. It is noted
that neither the Association of American Railroads (AAR) nor any railroad companies that commented on the NPRM, such
as Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, had any specific comments on the definition of locomotive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EMA provided definitions for ``locomotive'' and ``locomotive engine''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under this definition, the regulation of any engine mounted on a locomotive (such as an engine driving a crane or winch)
would be preempted. The dictionary definition of ``locomotive'' is a ``self-propelled vehicle, usually diesel
or electric, that travels on rails and moves railroad cars.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EMA's definition of locomotive engine goes beyond the specific purpose of locomotion to include any other engine
that might be placed on a locomotive. EPA believes that the term ``locomotive engine'' is limited to the engine used
to propel the locomotive and other railroad cars. However, EPA does believe that the term ``engines used in locomotives,''
as found in section 209(e)(1)(B), can be defined to include other engines which are mounted on a locomotive regardless
of whether they are used for purposes of self-propulsion. EPA notes that under this definitional framework the ``locomotive''
is only that piece of on-track equipment which is self-propelling and is designed for moving other cars containing
equipment, freight, or passengers. ``Engines used in locomotives'' thus includes an engine placed in the locomotive
to propel the train and also includes other engines mounted on the locomotive for auxiliary power generation for the
train, but does not include engines mounted on the train elsewhere than the locomotive. An engine providing power
for a crane or winch, for example, would only be considered preempted from state regulation (if it otherwise met the
requirements for ``new'') as ``an engine used in [a] locomotive'' if such engine were mounted on the locomotive. EPA
believes these definitions reflect the intent of Congress to reduce the burden on interstate commerce for the railroad
industry, and address EMA's concerns regarding auxiliary engines.

EPA has stricken the word ``carrying'' from the definition of locomotive. This was done to avoid implying that any
persons or property that were moved by the engine had to be located directly on the locomotive. The word ``moving''
in the definition is all that is needed to give the correct meaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the final rule, EPA has decided that a ``locomotive'' means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other
than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other
similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment, freight or passenger traffic. EPA has also decided that
the term ``engines used in locomotives'' means either an engine placed in the locomotive to move other equipment,
freight , or passenger traffic, or an engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power.

VII. Cost Analysis

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has adjusted its estimate of the average annual cost of this rule upward from approximately $29 million to $70 million.
EPA has decided to make the adjustment after analyzing new information provided by commenters with respect to the
engine modifications required to meet the adopted emission standards and updated cost information provided confidentially
by manufacturers. Based on EPA's revised analysis (see the final version of the Regulatory Support Document in the
docket), the Agency has adjusted the present value of the per engine increase in retail price of a 1996 model year engine
upward from approximately $110 per engine to approximately $220 per engine (in 1992 dollars).

To maintain acceptable performance throughout the engine speed band, some manufacturers commented that they will
choose to use waste-gate technology in lieu of smoke limiters on some of their engine models. These manufacturers
stated that, for their engine designs, applying a smoke limiter to control smoke could cause a performance discontinuity
that could present a safety concern under certain operating conditions. While the cost of waste-gate technology
was not accounted for in EPA's proposed cost impact, the Agency believes it is reasonable for manufacturers to use
a costlier solution in those cases where there is a potential performance or safety impact. EPA estimates that half
of the turbocharged engines could be fitted with this technology. That represents approximately 30 percent of all
engines covered by this rule with a parallel 30 percent reduction in use of smoke limiter technology. Based on average
per piece cost figures submitted by manufacturers, EPA has calculated that the addition of waste-gate technology
in the technology mix would result in a per engine weighted hardware cost increase of approximately $35 per engine,
while the weighted cost due to use of smoke limiter technology will be revised to $3 per engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also assumed in its estimate of hardware cost that there would be little or no cost involved with upgrading fuel
pumps to increased injection pressures (as opposed to changing pump type, rotary to in-line, in-line to unit injector).
During the comment period, manufacturers provided concrete evidence that there is a significant cost increment
to increasing injection pressures. Based on manufacturers' data an average weighted cost of $73 per engine will be
assessed to account for modifications that will allow in-line fuel pumps and unit fuel injection systems to accommodate
incremental increases in injection pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers also provided information on additional hardware costs. Electronic control systems and low sac fuel
injectors were two strategies mentioned. While electronic control will reduce NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission, EPA maintains that is not the most cost effective method to meet the requirements of this rule. A number of
marketing and performance reasons unrelated to emission performance, such as fuel economy and versatility, make
such strategies attractive to manufacturers. These reasons in and of themselves may cause manufacturers to convert
a portion of their fleets to electronic controls. Because EPA's cost estimate is based on the necessary cost to meet
this rule and to maintain current performance and fuel economy characteristics, the extra cost incurred by a manufacturer
to install electronic control will not be added to EPA cost estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, manufacturers requested that EPA include the cost of low sac injectors. Low sac injectors are an effective
HC control strategy. However, EPA's proposal did not contain HC standards, and the HC standard adopted in the final
rule can be expected to do no better than cap the current HC levels. Furthermore, EPA requested that manufacturers
provide information on the cost ramifications of adopting additional standards. Industry comments have stated
that EPA's adoption of the HC standard will not increase the cost of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it has adequately accounted for costs of low sac injectors in its fuel system cost estimates and will not
report a separate cost line to account for the limited usage of low sac injectors caused by this rulemaking. A percentage
of the engine production volume by the 1996 model year will be using low sac injectors whether regulations are in place
or not. An additional percentage of regulated engines that undergo fuel system modifications will incorporate low
sac injectors at that time. Manufacturers that intend to do this have reported fuel system modification costs that
include the low sac injector costs. These costs are already included in the EPA hardware cost estimate under the ``Fuel
System Improvements'' section of the RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several manufacturers suggested that their engine model prices would increase more than the proposed EPA per engine
retail price increase. It should be noted that the EPA present value per engine retail price estimate is a relative
estimate aggregated across engines on a sales-weighted basis. Thus the estimate cannot be directly translated into
the price increase a consumer should expect to pay for a particular piece of equipment. For engines greater than 130
kW, the disaggregated data generally indicate that an engine purchaser can expect a price increase of approximately
$100 per 75 kW, which represents less than one percent of the equipment price in most cases. Price increases for engines
between 37 kW and 130 kW will generally increase between zero to two percent of the equipment price. These are general
estimates and there will be exceptions that do not show in EPA's reported aggregate value. In any event, relative industry
level estimates calculated for regulatory analysis purposes would not be expected to match the retail price of a particular
engine design. However, based on all data available (including confidential manufacturers' submissions), EPA
believes that its final adjusted estimate reported in the rulemaking is accurate in the aggregate and is consistent
with accepted regulatory costing methodology.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some comments suggested that the proposed rule would cause a significant increase in fuel consumption. EPA maintains
that the impact of this rule on fleet average fuel consumption will be minimal. EPA's experience with on-highway engines
is that fuel consumption decreases when the various technologies to control emissions are added. From 1988 to 1991,
fuel consumption decreased one percent, while NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoke decreased about 40 percent for the average on-highway engine. Specific power also increased four percent.
EPA's on-highway findings are consistent with an analysis presented by Caterpillar at the American Petroleum Institute
Off-Highway Forum in September, 1993 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (see the RSD for details of this analysis). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's estimate of hardware costs accounts for those additional costs needed to control fuel consumption beyond what
is necessary to reduce NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 emission levels to meet the standard. These methods to both reduce NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions and maintain current fuel consumption and performance have been used for a number of years in the on-highway
fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since fuel economy and power are important criteria for the consumers of these engines, most manufacturers commented
that they are going to add hardware to their engines in an effort to maintain current levels of performance. Some manufacturers
commented that while they would do their best to fully maintain the baseline fuel economy levels, selected engine
models would incur a small fuel economy penalty despite their efforts. While a small number of engine families may
not be capable, for either technical or cost reasons, to fully retain current fuel consumption and power levels, EPA's
past experience with the on-highway program has shown that most engine models will be able to attain the emission standards
without compromising fuel consumption or power. One manufacturer stated that it expected fuel efficiency to increase
over time as manufacturers optimize their engine designs. EPA has strong evidence from its historical database suggesting
that is the case.

EPA maintains that the impact of this rule on equipment in which regulated engines are installed will be minimal. EPA
has accounted for the cost of applying the range of engine technologies required to maintain engine efficiency so
that equipment modifications will not be required. Furthermore, the added program flexibilities, such as the later
implementation date for lower power engines and the implementation of the ABT program, provide means for manufacturers
to minimize any negative impacts. Based on EPA's analysis in the RSD and further discussed in the Response to Comments
document in the docket, EPA believes that the adopted rules provide the means to avoid equipment modifications in
all but the most severe cases. These cases will not affect the aggregate cost analysis presented in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received with respect to equipment impacts centered around the need to redesign the engine cooling system
and increase maintenance to offset an expected loss in engine efficiency. A number of commenters disagreed with EPA's
assessment of no impact on equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA provided analysis in the draft RSD supporting minimal loss in engine efficiency. Manufacturers did not provide
data demonstrating efficiency losses and did not refute the data provided by EPA. Four equipment manufacturers and
their association did provide average cost figures. These cost figures were based on anticipated equipment modifications
and increased maintenance due to engine efficiency loss estimates that were not supported with data. Furthermore,
projections and costs for equipment modification and maintenance were highly aggregated and thus provided insufficient
resolution to establish the need for the projected equipment changes. Requests from EPA for additional data from
specific manufacturers were not responded to with sufficient detail. Based on the information available to EPA (and
discussed further in the Response to Comments in the docket), the Agency concludes that equipment modifications
will rarely be needed to accommodate certified engines.

IX. Cost Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating various pollution control options, EPA considers the cost effectiveness of the control. The cost effectiveness
of a pollution control measure is typically expressed as the cost per ton of pollutant emissions reduced. Other things
being equal, Agency guidance directs that the regulatory option selected should, for a given level of effectiveness,
cost less per ton of emissions reduced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it may adversely affect in a material way that sector of the economy involved with the production
of nonroad large CI engines and nonroad vehicles and equipment using those engines, previously unregulated by EPA.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record.

C. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of
these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. This
regulation will affect manufacturers of large nonroad CI engines, a group that does not contain a substantial number
of small entities. Manufacturers will be able to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by the averaging, banking,
and trading program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, I certify that this regulation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time
period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual
operating period of the seasonal source. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis (i.e., at least two years)
and that operates at that single location approximately three months (or more) each year. This paragraph does not
apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.

Section numbering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Sections are numbered sequentially by subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Where two different standards or requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrently applicable, the model year of applicability is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by the number following the main section number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two digits following the hyphen designate the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year for which a section is effective.

Example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 89.304&hyph;96 applies to the 1996 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent model years until superseded. If a &sect;89.304&hyph;98 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is promulgated, it would take effect beginning with the 1998 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year; &sect;89.304&hyph;96 would apply to model years 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 1997. Therefore, in calendar year 1997, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer may be certifying both 1997 and 1998 model year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, requiring the use of different requirements

concurrently.

 Model year 2000 and later will appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequentially with 1999 and earlier based on the order of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last two digits of the year, not in calendar year order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, &sect;89.304&hyph;03 will appear before &sect;89.304&hyph;99.

Appendix A to Subpart A_Internal Combustion Engines Manufactured Prior to July 18, 1994
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix sets forth the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) interpretation of the Clean Air Act regarding
the status of certain internal combustion engines manufactured before July 18, 1994, (the effective date of the final
rulemaking promulgating EPA's definition of nonroad engine). This interpretation does not alter, replace, supersede,
or change the scope of subpart A. It is not final agency action subject to judicial review.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. EPA interprets the Clean Air Act as not precluding state regulation of internal combustion engines manufactured
prior to July 18, 1994, except that state regulation of such engines that are used in motor vehicles or vehicles used
solely for competition is precluded. EPA believes that the language of Clean Air Act section 302(z) generally excluding
emissions resulting directly from nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles from the definition of stationary source
could not be applied until after the definition of nonroad engine was specified in final regulations promulgated
by EPA. EPA believes that if the exclusionary language of section 302(z) were applied before EPA's definition of nonroad
engine became final, states would have been frustrated from regulating internal combustion engines manufactured
during that time, given the uncertain nature of the definition of such engines. EPA believes that Congress did not
intend states to be prevented from regulating these engines before a final EPA definition was promulgated. EPA does
not believe that Congress intended the exclusionary language of section 302(z) regarding nonroad engines and vehicles
to be applied retroactively to engines, vehicles, and equipment regulated pursuant to a permit issued before the
date that the terms nonroad engine and nonroad vehicle were defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA further believes that internal combustion engines manufactured prior to July 18, 1994 are not preempted, under
Clean Air Act section 209, from state regulation. The two sections of the Act preempting state regulation of nonroad
engines, section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a) (as incorporated by section 213(d)), refer to ``nonroad engines subject
to regulation under this Act'' or to engines ``subject to this part'' (i.e., part A of title II of the Act). EPA believes
that, until EPA promulgated final regulations defining nonroad engines and subjecting such engines to regulation,
these engines were not preempted from state regulation under the Act, as the engines were not yet defined as nonroad
engines, nor were they subject to any regulation under title II of the Act. In the regulations with an effective date
of July 18, 1994, EPA has issued final rules defining nonroad engines and, thus, subjecting nonroad engines to regulation
under part A of title II of the Act. Accordingly, EPA believes that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 209, state regulation
of new nonroad engines is preempted for engines manufactured on or after that date, and is not preempted as to engines
manufactured before that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Moreover, EPA believes that states are not precluded under section 209 from regulating the use and operation of
nonroad engines, such as regulations on hours of usage, daily mass emission limits, or sulfur limits on fuel; nor are
permits regulating such operations precluded once the engine is placed into service or once the equitable or legal
title to the engine or vehicle is transferred to an ultimate purchaser, as long as no certification, inspection, or
other approval related to the control on emissions is required as a condition precedent to the initial retail sale,
titling, or registration of the engine or equipment. EPA believes that states are not prevented by section 209 from
requiring retrofitting of nonroad engines in certain circumstances once a reasonable time has passed after the engine
is no longer new, as long as the requirements do not amount to a standard relating back to the original manufacturer.
Therefore, EPA believes that modest retrofit requirements may be required after a reasonable amount of time (e.g.,
at the time of reregistration or rebuilding) and more significant retrofit requirements may be required after a more
significant period of time (e.g., after the end of the useful life of the engine).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Each test engine must be configured to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of actual in-use operation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may specify the adjustment of any adjustable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter. All test results must be reported to the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Confirmatory testing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct confirmatory testing or other testing on any test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. The manufacturer must deliver test engines as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by the Administrator. When the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducts confirmatory testing or other testing, those test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results are used to determine compliance with emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of carryover test data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In lieu of testing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify an engine family for a given model year, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer may submit, with the Administrator's approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission test data used to certify that engine family in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous years. This ``carryover'' data is only allowable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submitted test data show that the test engine would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the emission standard(s) for the model year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which certification is being sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either Table 4 or Table 5 of appendix A to subpart D of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part in confirmatory testing or other testing on any test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. Emission test results based on use of Table 5 fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be used to confirm compliance with HC, CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel will be used to confirm compliance with HC, CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke standards; when a manufacturer uses the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in Table 4 of appendix A to subpart D of this part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for its certification testing, EPA has the option to use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM emission result, corrected using the PM correction factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in &sect;89.425&hyph;96, to confirm compliance with the PM

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If all test engines representing an engine family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have emissions less than or equal to each emission standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that family complies with the emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If any test engine representing an engine family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has emissions greater than each emission standard, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family will be deemed not in compliance with the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If aftertreatment is employed by an engine family, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then a deterioration factor must be determined and applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For engine families included in the averaging, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Any facility where any document, design, or procedure relating to the translation of the design and construction
of engines and emission-related components described in the application for certification or used for certification
testing into production engines is located or carried on; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any facility where any engines to be introduced into commerce are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured or assembled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) On admission to any such facility referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, any EPA enforcement officer or EPA
authorized representative shall be allowed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or assembly and other procedures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or designs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such new engines and any component used in the assembly thereof
that are reasonably related to the purpose of his or her entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative shall be furnished by those in charge of a facility
being inspected with such reasonable assistance as he or she may request to help the enforcement officer or authorized
representative discharge any function listed in this paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of certification
is required to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without
charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services;
the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform
the EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative of how the facility operates and to answer the officer's
questions; and the performance on request of emission tests on any engine which is being, has been, or will be used for
certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate service accumulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A manufacturer may be compelled to cause any employee at a facility being inspected to appear before an EPA enforcement
officer or EPA authorized representative. The request for the employee's appearance shall be in writing, signed
by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, and served on the manufacturer. Any employee who has been instructed
by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative applies
whether or not the applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign manufacturers
and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However,
if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to ensure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed
judgment that an engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility
of the manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will
not arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Any entry without 24 hours prior written or oral notification to the affected manufacturer shall be authorized
in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement.

Averaging 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for nonroad engines means the exchange of emission credits among engine families within a given manufacturer's product
line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Banking 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the retention of nonroad engine emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use
in future model year averaging or trading as permitted by these regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission credits 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
represent the amount of emission reduction or exceedance, by a nonroad engine family, below or above the emission
standard, respectively. Emission reductions below the standard are considered as ``positive credits,'' while
emission exceedances above the standard are considered as ``negative credits.'' In addition, ``projected credits''
refer to emission credits based on the projected applicable production/sales volume of the engine family. ``Reserved
credits'' are emission credits generated within a model year waiting to be reported to EPA at the end of the model year.
``Actual credits'' refer to emission credits based on actual applicable production/sales volume as contained in
the end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or all of these credits may be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year
reports or any subsequent audit action(s) uncovers problems or errors.

Dynamometer calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If necessary, follow the dynamometer manufacturer's instructions for initial start-up and basic operating
adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Check the dynamometer torque measurement for each range used by the following method: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Warm up the dynamometer following the dynamometer manufacturer's specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine the dynamometer calibration moment arm (a distance/weight measurement). Dynamometer manufacturer's
data, actual measurement, or the value recorded from the previous calibration used for this subpart may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When calibrating the engine flywheel torque transducer, any lever arm used to convert a weight or a force through
a distance into a torque must be in a horizontal position (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 degrees). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Calculate the indicated torque (IT) for each calibration weight to be used by: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
IT = calibration weight (N) &times; calibration moment arm (m) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Attach each calibration weight specified in &sect;89.306&hyph;96 to the moment arm at the calibration distance
determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Record the power measurement equipment response (N^m) to each weight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For each calibration weight, compare the torque value measured in paragraph (b)(5) of this section to the calculated
torque determined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The measured torque must be within 2 percent of the calculated torque. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If the measured torque is not within 2 percent of the calculated torque, adjust or repair the system. Repeat steps
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section with the adjusted or repaired system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Optional. A master load-cell or transfer standard may be used to verify the torque measurement system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The master load-cell and read out system must be calibrated with weights at each test weight specified in &sect;89.306&hyph;96.
The calibration weights must be traceable to within 0.1 percent of applicable national standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Warm up the dynamometer following the equipment manufacturer's specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Load the dynamometer to a minimum of 6 equally spaced torque values as indicated by the master load-cell for each
in-use range used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The in-use torque measurement must be within 2 percent of the torque measured by the master system for each load
used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the in-use torque is not within 2 percent of the master torque, adjust or repair the system. Repeat steps in paragraphs
(c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section with the adjusted or repaired system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Calibrated resistors may not be used for engine flywheel torque transducer calibration, but may be used to span
the transducer prior to engine testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Perform other engine dynamometer system calibrations as dictated by good engineering practice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) For each component (pump, sample line section, filters, and so forth) in the heated portion of the sampling system
that has a separate source of power or heating element, use engineering judgment to locate the coolest portion of that
component and monitor the temperature at that location. If several components are within an oven, then only the surface
temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and the oven temperature need be measured.

Emission measurement accuracy_Bagged sampling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer readings below 15 percent of full-scale
chart deflection should generally not be used. (2) Some high resolution read-out systems, such as computers, data
loggers, and so forth, can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems
may be used provided that additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curves. If a gas
divider is used, the gas divider must conform to the accuracy requirements specified in &sect;89.312&hyph;96(c).
The following procedure for calibration below 15 percent of full scale may be used: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Span the full analyzer range using a top range calibration gas meeting the accuracy requirements of &sect;89.312&hyph;96(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Generate a calibration curve according to, and meeting the requirements of, &sect;&sect;89.319&hyph;96 through
89.323&hyph;96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Select a calibration gas (a span gas may be used for calibrating the CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 analyzer) with a concentration midway between the two lowest calibration gases or non-zero gas divider increments.
This gas must be ``named'' to an accuracy of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2.0 percent of NIST gas standards, or other standards approved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section,
check the concentration of the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The concentration derived
from the curve must be within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected
in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the calibration points. Fit a calibration
curve per &sect;&sect;89.319&hyph;96 through 89.322&hyph;96 of this chapter for the entire analyzer range.

 Analyzers used for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured concentration falls between 15 and
100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. Exceptions to these limits are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent or more than 100 percent of full scale if automatic range change
circuitry is used and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full scale if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Alternative (c)(2) of this section is used to ensure that the accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below
15 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

adjustment can indicate a need for instrument maintenance.): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The calibration is checked by using a zero gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a span gas whose nominal value is between 80 percent and 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of full-scale, inclusive, of the measuring range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After the emission test a zero gas and the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
span gas will be used for rechecking. The analysis will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered acceptable if the difference between the two

(a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being analyzed can interfere with the reading in several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways. Positive interference occurs in NDIR and PMD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments when the interfering gas gives the same effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas broadening the absorption band of the measured gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CLD instruments by the interfering gas quenching the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to introduction into service and at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually thereafter, adjust the FID hydrocarbon analyzer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optimum hydrocarbon response as specified in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Follow good engineering practices for initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument start-up and basic operating adjustment using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate fuel (see &sect;89.312&hyph;96(e)) and zero-grade air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One of the following procedures is required for FID 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or HFID optimization: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The procedure outlined in Society of Automotive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineers (SAE) paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of a Flame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ionization Detector for Determination of Hydrocarbon in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diluted Automotive Exhausts''; author, Glenn D. Reschke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86.331&hyph;79 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record them for future reference.

Initial and periodic calibration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the FID or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HFID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be calibrated on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally used instrument ranges using the steps in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph. Use the same flow rate and pressures as when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzing samples. Calibration gases shall be introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly at the analyzer, unless the ``overflow'' calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of &sect;86.1310&hyph;90(b)(3)(i) of this chapter for the HFID 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Calibrate on each used operating range with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propane-in-air (dilute) or propane-in-nitrogen (raw) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration gases having nominal concentrations starting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 10&hyph;15 percent and increasing in at least six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental steps to 90 percent of that range. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental steps are to be spaced to represent good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering practice. For each range calibrated, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or less of the value at each data point, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration values may be calculated by use of a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which represents the data to within 2 percent of each test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point shall be used to determine concentration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calibration curve. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Develop a calibration curve for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each range used as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Zero the analyzer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Span the analyzer to give a response of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 90 percent of full-scale chart deflection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 0.5 percent of full scale, repeat the steps given in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Record the response of calibration gases having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal concentrations starting between 10 and 15 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and increasing in at least six incremental steps to 90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of that range. The incremental steps are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spaced to represent good engineering practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Generate a calibration curve. The calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curve shall be of fourth order or less, have five or fewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients. If any range is within 2 percent of being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linear a linear calibration may be used. Include zero as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data point. Compensation for known impurities in the zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas can be made to the zero-data point. The calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curve must fit the data points within 2 percent of point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Optional. A new calibration curve need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A calibration curve conforming to paragraph (b)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section exists; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The responses generated in paragraph (b)(4) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section are within 1 percent of full scale or 2 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of point, whichever is less, of the responses predicted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calibration curve for the gases used in paragraph (b)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If multiple range analyzers are used, the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range used must meet the curve fit requirements below 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of full scale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on
an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant,
exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour
(g/kW-hr).

Test procedure overview. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer.
The exhaust gases, generated raw or dilute during engine operation, are sampled for specific component analysis
through the analytical train. The test is applicable to engines equipped with catalytic or direct-flame afterburners,
induction system modifications, or other systems, or to uncontrolled engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides
of nitrogen. The test consists of one idle mode, four power modes at one speed and three power modes at another speed.
These procedures require the determination of the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow,
and the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each pollutant
emitted per kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) (1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions, the complete engine shall be tested with all emission control
devices installed and functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, or air compressors) may be installed but such
accessory loading will be considered parasitic in nature and observed power shall be used in the emission calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the application must be functioning during all procedures
in this subpart. In cases of component malfunction or failure, maintenance to correct component failure or malfunction
must be authorized in accordance with &sect;86.094&hyph;25 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The engine must be equipped with an electrical generation device typical of one used in customer service (such
as an alternator). The power drain from it must be no greater than what is sufficient to operate the engine on the test
stand.

(c) If during the test, the filter element(s) were replaced or cleaned, a vacuum check must be performed per &sect;89.316&hyph;96(a)
immediately after the span checks. If the vacuum side leak check does not meet the requirements of &sect;89.316&hyph;96(a),
the test is void.

Automatic data collection equipment requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, and
so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the following is required: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For bag sample analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for
the dilute exhaust sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized
period shall be stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For continuous analysis systems, a single value representing the average integrated concentration over a cycle
shall be stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this
section may be stored on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage discs, punch cards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and so forth, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records
from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC equipment is subject to the calibration specifications
of the analyzer as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be stored as chart recorder records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bag sample analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For bag sample analysis perform the following sequence: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and
so forth, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obtain a stable zero reading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Zero and span the analyzers with zero and span gases. The span gases must have concentrations between 75 and 100
percent of full-scale chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures during spanning shall be approximately
the same as those encountered during sampling. A sample bag may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to identify the required analyzer range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Recheck zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (c)(3) of this
section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section must be repeated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Measure HC, CO, CO

(c)(3) of this section. (Constituents measured continuously do not require bag analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) A post-analysis zero and span check of each range must be performed and the values recorded. The number of events
that may occur between the pre- and post-analysis checks is not specified. However, the difference between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section) versus those recorded
for the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span drift limit of 2 percent of full-scale chart

 For continuous sample analysis perform the following sequence: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and
so forth, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated
sample lines, filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Optional: Perform a hangup check for the HFID sampling system: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. The HFID analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned
through the overflow sampling system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (d)(5) of this
section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section must be repeated.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Schematic drawing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An example of a sampling and analytical system which may be used for testing under this subpart is shown in Figure 1 in
appendix B to subpart D. All components or parts of components that are wetted by the sample or corrosive calibration
gases shall be either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemically cleaned stainless steel or inert material, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene resin. The use of ``gauge
savers'' or ``protectors'' with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sample probe.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The sample probe shall be a straight, closed-end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The inside diameter shall
not be greater than the inside diameter of the sample line plus 0.03 cm. The wall thickness of the probe shall not be greater
than 0.10 cm. The fitting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attaches the probe to the exhaust pipe shall be as small as practical in order to minimize heat loss from the probe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The probe shall have a minimum of three holes. The spacing of the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such
that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. See Figure 1 in appendix A to this subpart.
The angular spacing of the holes must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one plane may not be 180
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; (that is, section view C-C of Figure 1 in appendix A to this subpart). The holes should be sized such that each has
approximately the same flow. If only three holes are used, they may not all be in the same radial plane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The probe shall extend radially across the exhaust duct. The probe must pass through the approximate center and
must extend across at least 80 percent of the diameter of the duct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The maximum inside diameter of the sample line shall not exceed 1.32 cm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is used, the sample probe must connect directly to valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The location of optional valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may not be greater than 1.22 m from the exhaust duct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The location of optional valve 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
V16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may not be greater than 61 cm from the sample pump. The leakage rate for this section on the pressure side of the sample
pump may not exceed the leakage rate specification for the vacuum side of the pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Venting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All vents, including analyzer vents, bypass flow, and pressure relief vents of regulators, should be vented in such
a manner to avoid endangering personnel in the immediate area.

(e) Any variation from the specifications in this subpart including performance specifications and emission detection
methods may be used only with prior approval by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Additional components, such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, switches, and so forth, may be employed
to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system used for raw testing under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The sample for all components shall be taken with one sample probe, except as allowed under &sect;89.413&hyph;96,
and internally split to the different analyzers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Raw sampling procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Follow these procedures when sampling for gaseous emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The gaseous emission sampling probe must be installed at least 0.5 m or 3 times the diameter of the exhaust pipe_whichever
is the larger_upstream of the exit of the exhaust gas system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of a multi-cylinder engine with a branched exhaust manifold, the inlet of the probe shall be located
sufficiently far downstream so as to ensure that the sample is representative of the average exhaust emissions from
all cylinders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In multi-cylinder engines having distinct groups of manifolds, such as in a ``Vee'' engine configuration, it
is permissible to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sample after all exhaust pipes have been connected together into a single exhaust pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each mode, sample from each exhaust pipe and average the gaseous concentrations to determine a value for each
mode. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sample from all exhaust pipes simultaneously with the sample lines connected to a common manifold prior to the
analyzer. It must be demonstrated that the flow rate through each individual sample line is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4 percent of the average flow rate through all the sample lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Use another method, if it has been approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All heated sampling lines shall be fitted with a heated filter to extract solid particles from the flow of gas required
for analysis. The sample line for CO, CO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the composition of the exhaust gas is influenced by any treatment such as heat exchanger or air injection (except
catalysts and soot filters) then the exhaust probe must be taken upstream of this device.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The air flow measurement method used must have a range large enough to accurately measure the air flow over the engine
operating range during the test. Overall measurement accuracy must be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 percent or less of the reading. The Administrator must be advised of the method used prior to testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When an engine system incorporates devices that affect the air flow measurement (such as air bleeds) that result
in understated exhaust emission results, corrections to the exhaust emission results shall be made to account for
such effects.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exhaust gas sampling system described in this section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions
in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled nonroad compression-ignition engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept
(described in &sect;86.1310&hyph;90 of this chapter) of measuring mass emissions of HC, CO, and CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 measurements. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test
period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement
of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. General requirements are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP&hyph;CVS and a heat exchanger or a CFV&hyph;CVS with either a heat
exchanger or electronic flow compensation. Figure 2 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the PDP&hyph;CVS
system. Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the CFV&hyph;CVS system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&cir;C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously
over the test cycle. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, the HFID must be used with a constant flow system
to ensure a representative sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The heated probe shall be located in the primary dilution tunnel and far enough downstream of the mixing chamber
to ensure a uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the point of sampling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The CO and CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The components necessary for exhaust sampling shall meet the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exhaust dilution system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PDP&hyph;CVS shall conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP&hyph;CVS in &sect;86.1309&hyph;90(b)
of this chapter. The CFV&hyph;CVS shall conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas CFV&hyph;CVS
in &sect;86.1309&hyph;90(c) of this chapter. In addition, the CVS must conform to the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream at or below the temperature
required for the measurement of hydrocarbon emissions noted in the following paragraph and to prevent condensation
of water at any point in the dilution tunnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the primary dilution
tunnel at a temperature of 191 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement and as required to prevent condensation at any point
in the dilution tunnel. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this sampling point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the CFV&hyph;CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation is required (see Figure 3 in appendix
A to this subpart).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For the CFV&hyph;CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately
ahead of the critical flow venturi, shall be within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) of the average operating temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement that condensation
does not occur. The temperature measuring system (sensors and readout) shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining
constant temperature is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The primary dilution air shall have a temperature of 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

Continuous HC measurement system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The continuous HC sample system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in appendix A to this subpart) uses an ``overflow'' zero
and span system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills out of the probe when zero and span checks of the
analyzer are made. The ``overflow'' system may also be used to calibrate the HC analyzer per &sect;86.1321&hyph;90(b)
of this chapter, although this is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample
pump is used for all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good engineering practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line shall be at least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close as practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct
or dilution tunnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The continuous HC sampling system shall consist of a probe (which must raise the sample to the specified temperature)
and, where used, a sample transfer system (which must maintain the specified temperature). The continuous hydrocarbon
sampling system (exclusive of the probe) shall:

accurate results, exact conformance with the drawing is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. Additional components such as instruments, valves,

solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information and coordinate the functions of the

component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical system shall conform to the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. Other types of analyzers may be used if shown to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the

Administrator.

Dilute sampling procedures_CVS calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictor valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to NIST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements, and will serve as the reference value (NIST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``true'' value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should an upstream screen or other restriction which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the flow be used ahead of the flowmeter unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrated throughout the flow range with such a device.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a ``metering venturi'' type flowmeter. Large radius or ASME 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow nozzles are considered equivalent if traceable to NIST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traceable to NIST measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded and related to flow through the CVS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Procedures used by EPA for both PDP&hyph;CVS and CFV&hyph;CVS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results may be used if approved in advance by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of the entire system may be performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of the system (for example, analyzer calibration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks, or HC hangup). A verification procedure is found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) All the parameters related to the pump are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The calculated flow rate, in
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(cm3/s), (at pump inlet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a correlation function which is the value of a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of pump parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the correlation function is then determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a calibration for each range used must be performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) This calibration procedure is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the calibration curve: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The temperature stability must be maintained during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration. (Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oscillations; this can cause the data points to be scattered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gradual changes in temperature are acceptable as long as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur over a period of several minutes.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate from the calibration equation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in appendix A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this subpart. Although particular types of equipment are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) After the system has been connected as shown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 5 in appendix A to this subpart, set the variable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS pump for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 minutes. Record the calibration data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition in an increment of pump inlet depression that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data acquisition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

CVS system verification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following ``gravimetric'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments can accurately measure a mass of gas that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injected into the system. (Verification can also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by constant flow metering using critical flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orifice devices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99.5 percent or greater propane or carbon monoxide gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Caution_carbon monoxide is poisonous). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.01 grams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of pure propane into the system during the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (approximately 5 minutes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The calculations are performed in the normal way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kg/m3/carbon atom)) is used in place of the density of exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbons.

Test orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A test order addressed to the manufacturer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for any testing under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The test order is signed by the Assistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator for Air and Radiation or his or her designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test order must be delivered in person by an EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company representative or sent by registered mail, return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed the application for certification submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer, pursuant to the requirements of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of subpart B of this part. Upon receipt of a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order, the manufacturer must comply with all of the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this subpart and instructions in the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information included in test order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order will specify the engine family to be selected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated storage facility or port facility (for imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by which engines of the specified family must be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test order may specify the configuration to be audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers are required to select a minimum of four engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to &sect;89.507&hyph;96(a), or unless total production of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total production of the specified configuration is less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four engines per day, the manufacturer selects the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of engines produced per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The test order may include alternate families to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected for testing at the Administrator's discretion in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event that engines of the specified family are not available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for testing because those engines are not being manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the specified time or are not being stored at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
port of entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rate of at least two engines per day in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers specified in &sect;89.508&hyph;96(g)(1), or one engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.508&hyph;96(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Assistant Administrator or her or his designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative may select engines of the alternate family for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In addition, the test order may include other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions or information essential to the administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the corresponding assembly plants, associated storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, or (in the case of imported engines) port 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities from which the manufacturer prefers to have engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected for testing in response to a test order. In order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not issue to a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Auditing (SEA) test orders than an annual limit determined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the larger of the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Production factor, determined by dividing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected nonroad engine sales in the United States for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year, as declared by the manufacturer under &sect;89.505- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96(c)(1), by 16,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the projected sales are less than 8,000, this factor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Family factor, determined by dividing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's total number of certified engine families by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or during the model year a reliable sales projection update or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adds engine families or deletes engine families from its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, that information is used for recalculating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's annual limit of SEA test orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any SEA test order for which the family fails under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.510&hyph;96 or for which testing is not completed is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted against the annual limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may issue additional test orders to test those families for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which evidence exists indicating noncompliance. An SEA test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order issued on this basis will include a statement as to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason for its issuance.

&sect;89.503&hyph;96 that engines of a specified family be selected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a manner consistent with the requirements of &sect;89.507&hyph;96 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Administrator at the place designated for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of conducting emission tests. These tests will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in accordance with &sect;89.508&hyph;96 to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines manufactured by the manufacturer conform with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with respect to which the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity was issued.

Administrator conducts a test on a test engine or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator and manufacturer each conduct a test on the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test engine, the results of the Administrator's test comprise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the official data for that engine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test engine, the manufacturer's test data is accepted as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official data, provided that if the Administrator makes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination based on testing conducted under paragraph (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section that there is a substantial lack of agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the manufacturer's test results and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If testing conducted under &sect;89.503&hyph;96 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's determination that the test facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate for conducting the tests required by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart and the reasons therefor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer that the data acquired under &sect;89.503&hyph;96 was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous and the manufacturer's data was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator reconsider the determination in paragraph (b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section based on data or information which indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that changes have been made to the test facility and these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes have resolved the reasons for disqualification.

entry and access as authorized in this section, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, to execute the functions specified in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. EPA enforcement officers or authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives may proceed ex parte to obtain a warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not the EPA enforcement officers or EPA authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives first attempted to seek permission of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section only upon the consent of the recipient of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order or the party in charge of the facilities in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) It is not a violation of this part or the Clean Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act for any person to refuse to permit an EPA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the location and in the manner specified in the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected in the manner specified in the test order, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the start of test sample selection, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator approves the procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The manufacturer must assemble the test engines of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the family selected for testing using its normal mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production process for engines to be distributed into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. If, between the time the manufacturer is notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change(s) in its production processes, including quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer must, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the test engines are selected at a location where they do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have their operational and emission control systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed, the test order will specify the manner and location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for selection of components to complete assembly of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. The manufacturer must assemble these components onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test engines using normal assembly and quality control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures as documented by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be used during the production and assembly of all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification in assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The order in which test engines are selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines the order in which test results are to be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying the sampling plan in accordance with &sect;89.510&hyph;96. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail decision is reached in accordance with &sect;89.510&hyph;96(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed the requirements as set forth in &sect;89.510&hyph;96(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.508&hyph;96(i).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine 8-mode test procedure as described in subpart E of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, the federal smoke test as described in part 86, subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I of this chapter, and the particulate test procedure as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted in the California Regulations for New 1996 and Later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference. See &sect;89.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any nonroad engine he or she determines is not susceptible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory testing using the procedures specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or modify the engines selected for testing and may not perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any emission tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification, and/or tests are documented in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with &sect;89.108&hyph;96, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any setting within the physically adjustable range of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;89.108&hyph;96, prior to the performance of any tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may not adjust it to any setting which causes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance characteristics and surveillance information from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar in-use engines.

Service Accumulation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to performing exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data engine corresponding to the family specified in the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of normal production engines. This service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation must be consistent with the new engine break-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions contained in the applicable owner's manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manufacturer must accumulate service at a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of 16 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise approved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The first 24-hour period for service begins as soon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed on each engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not apply on weekends or holidays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the minimum rate specified (16 hours per day), then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum daily accumulation rate is equal to the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Service accumulation must be completed on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient number of test engines during consecutive 24-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods to assure that the number of engines tested per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test engines after selection for testing, nor may the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator allow deletion of any engine from the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator before any engine maintenance or deletion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The manufacturer must expeditiously ship test engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of selection, the manufacturer must assure that test engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may approve more time for shipment based upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a test order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the Administrator within one working day of receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test order as to which test facility will be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the test order. If no test cells are available at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the United States market for the applicable year of 7,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two engines per 24-hour period, including each voided test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each smoke test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one engine per 24-hour period, including each voided test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each smoke test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission testing based upon a request by a manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanied by a satisfactory justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The manufacturer must perform test engine selection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping, preparation, service accumulation, and testing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Initial test results are calculated following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable test procedure specified in paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.508&hyph;96. The manufacturer rounds these results, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with ASTM E29&hyph;90, to the number of decimal places 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional significant figure. This procedure has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference. See &sect;89.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final test results are calculated by summing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each test engine, dividing by the number of tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted on the engine, and rounding in accordance with ASTM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E29&hyph;90 to the same number of decimal places contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable standard expressed to one additional significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within five working days after completion of testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A failed engine is one whose final test results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to &sect;89.509&hyph;96(b), for one or more of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants, exceed the applicable emission standard or family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The manufacturer must test engines comprising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test sample until a pass decision is reached for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants or a fail decision is reached for one pollutant. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutant is less than or equal to the pass decision number, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cumulative number of engines tested. A fail decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached when the cumulative number of failed engines for one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more pollutants is greater than or equal to the fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the cumulative number of engines tested.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cumulative number of engines tested are determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the tables in appendix A to this subpart, ``Sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plans for Selective Enforcement Auditing of Nonroad Engines,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the projected sales as made by the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its report to EPA under &sect;89.505&hyph;96(c)(1). In the tables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in appendix A to this subpart, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a pass or fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engines with final test results exceeding the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further for the purposes of the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made on the last engine required to make a decision under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to any engine failing pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.510&hyph;96 effective from the time that testing of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity for a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to paragraph &sect;89.510&hyph;96(c), based on the first test or all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests conducted on each engine. This suspension will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur before ten days after failure of the audit, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer requests an earlier suspension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the results of testing pursuant to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations indicate that engines of a particular family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with respect to which the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate of conformity with respect to that family for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application may be covered by a certificate of conformity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following infractions to be substantial: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of a test order issued by the Administrator under

&sect;89.503&hyph;96. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in any report or information provided to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative(s) is denied the opportunity to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities related to entry and access as authorized in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative(s) is unable to conduct activities related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry and access as authorized in &sect;89.506&hyph;96 because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer has located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where local law prohibits those activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Administrator must notify the manufacturer in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of

effective upon receipt of the notification or ten days, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity for a family when the certificate has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in the application for certification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected family.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer
must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines,
describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance
measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which
the remedies will be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply
with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family, at the plant(s),
port facility(ies) or associated storage facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the
conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines
after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually determined to be in conformance
with the applicable standards or family emission levels through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures,
provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Once the certificate for a family has been revoked under paragraph (f) of this section and the manufacturer desires
to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before
the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for that modified family: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance
deterioration, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report
in paragraph (g) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart is sufficient to evaluate the proposed
change or changes or whether additional testing is required; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate
that the modified engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal
production runs of that modified engine family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order.
If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the Administrator will reissue the certificate or issue a
new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing
requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation remains in effect.
Any design change approvals under this subpart are limited to the family affected by the test order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification
of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph
(b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted
or any sampling methods have been properly applied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (d) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) will be in writing and will include the offer of an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with &sect;&sect;89.512&hyph;96,
89.513&hyph;96, and 89.514&hyph;96 and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) need not apply to engines no longer in the hands of the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section and prior to
the commencement of a hearing under &sect;89.512&hyph;96, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's
satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the
Administrator will reinstate the certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a
failure of an SEA and while reauditing of the failed family, it may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate
the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition that the
manufacturer consents to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally
reinstated if the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and to remedy any nonconformity at
no expense to the owner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision under &sect;89.511&hyph;96 (b), (c), (d),
or (f) to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to &sect;89.511&hyph;96
(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The manufacturer's request must be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's
notification of the decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer
must simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division
and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the
time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting
a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, at her or his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer
a hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The manufacturer's request for a public hearing must include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family is to be the subject of the hearing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing
requested under &sect;89.511&hyph;96(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted, specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with
applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied, specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in
Appendix A of this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants
other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision
under &sect;89.511&hyph;96(c);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues
raised; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available
to the public during Agency business hours.

(b) EPA will not require a U.S. Customs Service bond for a nonconforming nonroad engine which is imported under &sect;89.605&hyph;96
or &sect;89.609&hyph;96. The period of conditional admission may not exceed 120 days. Nonroad engines imported
under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96 may not be operated during the period of conditional admission
except for that operation necessary to comply with the requirements of this subpart. During the period of conditional
admission applicable to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, the importer must store the nonroad engine
at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) During the period of conditional admission under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, an ICI may
transfer responsibility of a nonroad engine to another qualified ICI for the purposes of complying with this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transferee ICI must be a holder of a currently valid certificate of conformity for the specific nonroad engine
being transferred or be authorized to import the nonroad engine pursuant to &sect;89.609&hyph;96 as of the transfer
date. The transferee ICI must comply with all the requirements of &sect;89.603&hyph;96, &sect;89.604&hyph;96,
and either &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the purpose of this subpart, the transferee ICI has ``imported'' the nonroad engine as of the transfer date
as designated in a written record that is signed by both ICIs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ICI that originally imported the nonroad engine is responsible for all requirements of this subpart from the
actual date of importation until the date of transfer as designated in the written record. The transferee ICI is responsible
for all requirements of this subpart beginning on the date of transfer.

(4) A copy of the written record is to be submitted to the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA within five working
days of the transfer date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart or U.S. Customs Service regulations, an ICI may also assume
responsibility for the modification and testing of a nonconforming nonroad engine which was previously imported
by another party. The ICI must be a holder of a currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid certificate of conformity for that specific nonroad engine or authorized to import it pursuant to &sect;89.609&hyph;96
at the time of assuming such responsibility. The ICI must comply with all the requirements of &sect;89.603&hyph;96,
&sect;89.604&hyph;96, and either &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, as applicable. For the purposes
of this subpart, the ICI has ``imported'' the nonroad engine as of the date the ICI assumes responsibility for the modification
and testing of the nonroad engine. The ICI must submit written notification to the Manufacturers Operations Division
of EPA within 10 working days of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption of that responsibility.

(a) A nonroad engine may be finally admitted into the United States upon approval of the ICI's application to the Administrator.
The application is made by completing EPA forms in accordance with EPA instructions. The application contains: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The information required in &sect;89.604&hyph;96(a); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Information demonstrating that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with a valid certificate of
conformity. Demonstration is made in one of the following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate
of conformity; presents to EPA a statement written by the applicable Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) that the
OEM must provide to the ICI, and to EPA, information concerning production changes to the class of nonroad engines
described in the ICI's application for certification; delivers to the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA
notification by the ICI of any production changes already implemented by the OEM at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and their effect on emissions; and obtains from EPA written approval to use this demonstration option;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate
of conformity. The ICI also attests that it has conducted, within 120 days of entry, an applicable and valid emission
test on every third nonroad engine imported under that certificate of conformity to demonstrate compliance with
federal emission requirements. The test is to be conducted at a laboratory located within the United States. Sequencing
of the tests is determined by the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importation of each nonroad engine beginning with the prototype nonroad engine used to obtain the applicable certificate
of conformity. Should the ICI exceed a threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity
without adjustments or other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of required
testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The results of every emission test which the ICI conducted on the nonroad engine pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)
of this section. Should a subject nonroad engine fail an emission test at any time, the following procedures are applicable:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ICI may either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Conduct one retest that involves no adjustment of the nonroad engine from the previous test (for example, adjusting
the RPM, timing, air-to-fuel ratio, and so forth) other than adjustments to adjustable parameters that, upon inspection,
were found to be out of tolerance. When such an allowable adjustment is made, the parameter may be reset only to the specified
(that is, nominal) value (and not any other value within the tolerance band); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Initiate a change in production (production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes
the nonroad engine to meet federal emission requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the ICI chooses to retest in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The retests are to be completed no later than five working days subsequent to the first emission test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Should the subject nonroad engine fail the second emission test, then the ICI must initiate a change in production
(a production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal
emission requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the ICI chooses to initiate a change in production (a production change) under the provisions of subpart B
of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal requirements, a change involving adjustments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustable nonroad engine parameters (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air/fuel ratio) represents a change
in the specified (that is, nominal) value to be deemed acceptable by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A production change made in accordance with this section is to be implemented on all subsequent nonroad engines
imported under the certificate of conformity after the date of importation of the nonroad engine which gave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rise to the production change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Commencing with the first nonroad engine receiving the production change, every third nonroad engine imported
under the certificate of conformity is to be emission tested to demonstrate compliance with federal emission requirements
until, as in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity is exceeded without adjustments or
other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, at which time the amount of required emission

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A report concerning these production changes is to be made to both the Manufacturers Operations and Certification
Divisions of EPA within ten working days of initiation of the production change. The cause of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of an emission test is to be identified, if known; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The applicable deterioration factor, if any; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The emission test results adjusted by the deterioration factor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Other information that may be specified by applicable regulations or on the certificate of conformity under which
the nonroad engine has been modified in order to assure compliance with requirements of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) All information required under &sect;89.610&hyph;96 related to maintenance, warranties, and labeling; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) An attestation by the ICI that the ICI is responsible for the nonroad engine's compliance with federal emission
requirements, regardless of whether the ICI owns the nonroad engine imported under this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The name, address, and telephone number of the person who the ICI prefers to receive EPA notification under &sect;89.605&hyph;96(c);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) An attestation by the ICI that all requirements of &sect;89.607&hyph;96 and &sect;89.610&hyph;96 have been
met; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is to be presumed not to have been granted
if a requirement of this subpart has not been met. This includes, but is not limited to, properly modifying the nonroad
engine to be in conformity in all material respects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the description in the application for certification or not complying with the provisions of &sect;89.605&hyph;96(a)(2)
or if the final emission test results, adjusted by the deterioration factor, if applicable, do not comply with applicable
emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under
this section is presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or written notice from EPA to the contrary
within 15 working days of the date that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the ICI's application
under paragraph (a) of this section. EPA notice of nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the responsibility
of the ICI to ensure that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the
date of receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's
inspection. The storage is to be within 50 miles of the ICI's testing facility to allow the Administrator reasonable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access for inspection and/or testing. A storage facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by
the Administrator prior to the submittal of the ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is presumed not to have been granted if any
requirement of this subpart has not been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under
this section is presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or written notice from EPA to the contrary
within 15 working days of the date that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the ICI's application
under paragraph (b) of this section. Such EPA notice of nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the responsibility
of the ICI to ensure that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the
date of receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is stored at a location where the Administrator
has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's inspection. The storage is to be within 50 miles
of the ICI's testing facility to allow the Administrator reasonable access for inspection and/or testing. A storage
facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by the Administrator prior to the submittal of the
ICI's application under paragraph (b) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to final admission, a nonroad engine imported under this section is subject to special inspections as described
in &sect;89.606&hyph;96 with these additional provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, a significant number of nonroad engines imported by an ICI fail to comply
with emission requirements upon inspection or retest or if the ICI fails to comply with a provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations that pertain to nonroad engines imported pursuant to &sect;89.609&hyph;96, the ICI may be placed
on the EPA list of ICIs ineligible to import nonroad engines under this section as specified in paragraph (e) of this
section and &sect;89.612&hyph;96(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An individual nonroad engine which fails a retest or inspection is to be repaired and retested, as applicable,
to demonstrate compliance with emission requirements before final admission is granted by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Unless otherwise specified by EPA, the ICI bears the costs of all retesting under this subsection, including transportation.

in &sect;89.104&hyph;96(b), in accordance with &sect;89.608&hyph;96(a). If, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the judgment of the Administrator, a significant number of properly maintained and used nonroad engines imported
by the ICI pursuant to this section fail to meet emission requirements, the name of the ICI may be placed on the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of ICIs ineligible to import nonroad engines under the modification/test provision as specified in paragraph

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission-related parts added by the ICI, and the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control and emission-related parts furnished by the Original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine Manufacturer (OEM). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The information required in this section to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to the ultimate purchaser or owner is to be copied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintained in a file containing the records for that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Warranties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) ICIs must submit to the Manufacturers Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Division of EPA sample copies (including revisions) of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranty documents required by this section prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing nonroad engines under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ICIs must provide to nonroad engine owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission warranties identical to those required by sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
207(a) of the Act. The warranty period for each nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is to commence on the date the nonroad engine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered by the ICI to the ultimate purchaser or owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ICIs must provide warranty insurance coverage by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepaid mandatory service insurance policy underwritten by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an independent insurance company. The policy is to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Be subject to the approval of the Administrator if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the insurance coverage is less than the required warranty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At a minimum, provide coverage for emission-related components installed or modified by the ICI and, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum extent possible, the emission-related components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed by the OEM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Be transferable to each successive owner for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods specified in &sect;89.104&hyph;96(c); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Provide that in the absence of an ICI's facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being reasonably available (that is, within 50 miles) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of warranty repairs, the warranty repairs may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed anywhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ICIs must attest in each application for final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission that the warranty requirements have been met, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mandatory insurance has been paid and is in effect, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that certificates and statements of the warranties have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or will be provided to the owner or ultimate purchaser. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copy of the warranties and evidence that the warranties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid and in effect is to be maintained in a file containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the records for each nonroad engine prior to submitting each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for final admission pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or &sect;89.609&hyph;96(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission labeling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For each nonroad engine imported pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, the ICI must affix
a permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legible label which identifies each nonroad engine and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The label meets all the requirements of &sect;89.110&hyph;96 and contains the following statement ``This nonroad
engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was originally produced in (month and year of original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production). It has been imported and modified by (ICI's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name, address, and telephone number) to conform to United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States emission regulations applicable to the (year) model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the nonroad engine is owned by the ICI at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of importation, the label also states ``This nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is warranted for five years or 3000 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation from the date of purchase, whichever first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the nonroad engine is not owned by the ICI at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of importation, the label states ``This nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine is warranted for five years or 3000 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation from the date of release to the owner, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first occurs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For nonroad engines imported under &sect;89.609&hyph;96, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label clearly states in bold letters that ``This nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine has not been manufactured under a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity but conforms to United States emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations under a modification/test program.'' For all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engines imported pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.609&hyph;96, the label contains the vacuum hose routing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagram applicable to the nonroad engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As part of the application to the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for final admission of each individual nonroad engine under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.609&hyph;96, the ICI must maintain a copy of the labels for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each nonroad engine in a file containing the records for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that nonroad engine prior to submitting each application for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final admission. ICIs importing under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.609&hyph;96 must attest to compliance with the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling requirements of this section in each application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for final admission.

Exemptions and exclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Individuals, as well as ICIs, are eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing nonroad engines into the United States under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of this section, unless otherwise specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart, a nonroad engine entitled to one of the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions of this paragraph may be conditionally admitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the United States if prior written approval for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditional admission is to be under bond. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for approval from the Administrator is to contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification required in &sect;89.604&hyph;96(a) (except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.604&hyph;96(a)(5)) and information that demonstrates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the importer is entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the total amount of the bond or exportation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engine. The following temporary exemptions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted by this paragraph: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption for repairs or alterations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written approval by EPA, an owner of nonroad engines may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditionally import under bond such nonroad engines solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines may not be operated in the United States other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the sole purpose of repair or alteration. They may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be sold or leased in the United States and are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Testing exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A test nonroad engine may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditionally imported by a person subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;89.905. A test nonroad engine may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the United States provided that the operation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless a request is made by the appropriate importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the nonroad engine in accordance with &sect;89.905(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a subsequent one-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Precertification exemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A prototype nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine for use in applying to EPA for certification pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this subpart may be conditionally imported subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable provisions of &sect;89.906 and the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No more than one prototype nonroad engine for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine family for which an importer is seeking certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be imported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The granting of precertification exemptions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator is discretionary. Normally, no more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three outstanding precertification exemptions are allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each importer. No precertification exemption is allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the importer requesting the exemption is in noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any requirement of this subpart until the noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Unless a certificate of conformity is issued for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototype nonroad engine and the nonroad engine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finally admitted pursuant to the requirements of &sect;89.605 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 180 days from the date of entry, the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bond is to be forfeited or the nonroad engine exported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless an extension is granted by the Administrator. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for an extension is to be in writing and received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator prior to the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precertification exemption expires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Such precertification nonroad engine may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the United States other than for the sole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the precertification exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Display exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A nonroad engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported subject to the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;89.907. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A display nonroad engine may be imported by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person for purposes related to a business or the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display of a nonroad engine at a dealership, private use, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other purpose that the Administrator determines is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for display exemptions. A display nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine may not be sold in the United States and may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the United States except for the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incident and necessary to the display purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A temporary display exemption is granted for 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is shorter. Two extensions of up to 12 months each are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available upon approval by the Administrator. In no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 36 months. The U.S. Customs Service bonds a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary display exemption.

Testing exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance
with this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant with the purpose of the test program and EPA's
monitoring requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each
of the four identified elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations,
studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item
of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated
purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under
&sect;89.1003. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the
cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable
number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An estimate of the program's duration, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test
and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The technical nature of the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The site of the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The time or mileage duration of the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The intended final disposition of the engines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use
in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required
by the Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish
the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the record-keeping
and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph
(a) of this section.

(d) It is a condition of any exemption for the purpose of export under paragraph (a) of this section, that such exemption
is void ab initio with respect to a new nonroad engine intended solely for export, where such nonroad engine is sold,
or offered for sale, to an ultimate purchaser or otherwise distributed or introduced into commerce in the United States
for purposes other than export.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to &sect;89.905 or &sect;89.908, EPA determines
it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared and submitted to the person
requesting the exemption. The memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and
conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements
by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records
accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption,
take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the
activity and the ultimate disposition of the engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the
extent that the specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term or condition causes the exemption
to be void ab initio with respect to any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act prohibited under
&sect;89.1003( a)(1) or (a)(3), other than in strict conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption,
renders the person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom the provisions of &sect;89.1003(a)
are applicable, liable to suit under sections 204 and 205 of the Act.

 The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which
the defendant resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the court has jurisdiction to assess
a civil penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court is to take into account
the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the
violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation,
the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.

Administrative penalty authority.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any civil penalty
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator
in a penalty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General
jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment.
Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment
of a civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the
procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions,
any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.

Effect of administrator's action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce
any provisions of the Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently
prosecuting an action under this paragraph, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to
further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be
the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph shall affect a person's obligation to comply with a section
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Finality of order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An order issued under this subsection is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review
is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Judicial review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the assessment
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged
to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal place of business is located, within
the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously send a copy
of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the
court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued.
The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph unless
substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless
the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional
civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any
proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part
after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5)
of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall request that the
Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest
at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the final
order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness
of the penalty is not subject to review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph
(c)(6)(i) of this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement
expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for
each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the
aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such
quarter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The manufacturer of each nonroad engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser
that the engine is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under
section 213 of the Act, and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform
with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as determined under &sect;89.104&hyph;96). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of the part may certify according to &sect;85.2112
that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with emission standards promulgated in this
part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad engine warranted under this part is responsible for the
proper maintenance of the engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at
a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any
other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of
the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated
by this Act.

maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout
their recall period (as defined under &sect;89.104&hyph;96(b)), the Administrator shall immediately notify the
manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity
of the engines with respect to which such notification is given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such engines which are properly used and maintained
will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer.

Administrator shall afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views
and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws
such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing,
order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)
of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part.

(ii) The instruction under paragraph (3)(i) of this section must not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's
using, in connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without
charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Subject
instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers
of such manufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a commercial relationship,
and service performed by independent nonroad engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial
relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine will function properly only if the component or
service so identified is used in connection with such engine, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In addition, the manufacturer shall indicate by means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the engine that
the engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of assuring achievement of emission standards
prescribed under section 213 of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to control of emissions
as prescribed under &sect;89.110&hyph;96. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The manufacturer bears all cost obligation a dealer incurs as a result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a)
of this section. The transfer of any such cost obligation from a manufacturer to a dealer through franchise or other
agreement is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement respecting the cost or value of emission control devices
or systems, the manufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems
by the Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, and his or her representatives,
has the same access for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer as the Comptroller
General has to those of a recipient of assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any inspection of a nonroad engine for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, after its sale to the ultimate
purchaser, is to be made only if the owner of such vehicle or engine voluntarily permits such inspection to be made,
except as may be provided by any state or local inspection program.
