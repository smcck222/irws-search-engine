SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to update references to the ``Official
Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)'' Book of Methods. The 15th edition
of this AOAC publication was published in 1990, after its previous incorporation by reference in certain sections
of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. The AOAC's page numbers have changed and therefore
the citations in the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations also need to be changed. To make it easier
for the reader to find the referenced analytical methods in past editions and the current edition of this AOAC publication,
the new citations in the regulations reflect the chapters where the referenced methods can be found in this AOAC publication,
rather than the page numbers.

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) preempts all State
and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not
require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator, FSIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This final rule updates references
to a publication previously approved for incorporation by reference and changes cites for referenced analytical
methods from page numbers to chapters.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (1 CFR Part 51) requires that an Agency seeking approval of a change to a publication
that is approved for incorporation by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations publish notice of the change in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and amend the Code of Federal Regulations. The Agency must also ensure that a copy of the amendment or revision is on
file at the Office of the Federal Register and notify the Director of the Federal Register in writing that the change
is being made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 15th edition of the AOAC's ``Book of Methods'' for various kinds of chemical analyses was published in 1990. Certain
sections of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations containing references to this AOAC publication
refer the reader to page numbers in the previous edition. Therefore, these page numbers are not accurate for the current
edition of this AOAC publication. Also, some methods included in the 15th edition are not fully set out in it, but are
included only by reference to previous editions. Such methods can be found in their entirety in the 10th, 11th, 12th,
13th and/or 14th editions, which are not obsolete and should not be destroyed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To make it easier for the reader to find the referenced analytical methods in past editions and the current edition
of this AOAC publication, FSIS is amending its regulations to cite the chapters, rather than the page numbers, where
the referenced AOAC analytical methods can be found in any edition of this AOAC publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This publication has been previously approved for incorporation by reference. Therefore, it is found upon good cause
that public participation in this rulemaking procedure is impracticable and unnecessary, and good cause is found
for making the amendment effective less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553). A copy of the 1990 edition of the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical
Chemists'' is on file at the Office of the Federal Register. Copies of this publication may be purchased directly from
the AOAC at the address noted below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes,
that requires replacement of the thrust reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors.
This amendment is prompted by reports of piston seal leakage found during actuator overhaul on certain Model 767 series
airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible deployment of a thrust reverser in flight
and subsequent reduced controllability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing
Model 767 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12207). That action proposed to require replacement of the thrust reverser flow restrictor
devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 119 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A engines of the
affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 69 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this
AD, that it will take approximately 32 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General
Electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CF6&hyph;80A engines is estimated to be $121,440, or $1,760 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 95 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 engines of
the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 30 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by
this AD, that it will take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with
Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 engines is estimated to be $49,500, or $1,650 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $170,940. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Nordskog water heaters and coffee
makers. This amendment requires an inspection to determine whether certain discrepant pressure relief valves have
been installed in certain galley water heaters and coffee makers; and either replacement of the discrepant valves,
or discontinued use of the water heaters or coffee makers and installation of placards indicating that these units
are not to be used. This amendment is prompted by reports of injuries to cabin crew members that resulted from explosions
of galley water heaters. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent explosions of galley water heaters
and coffee makers, and subsequent injuries to passengers or cabin crew members.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Nordskog water heaters and coffee makers was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12203). That action proposed to require an inspection to determine whether certain discrepant
pressure relief valves have been installed in certain galley water heaters and coffee makers; and either replacement
of the discrepant valves, or discontinued use of the water heaters or coffee makers and installation of placards indicating
that these units are not to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter supports the proposed AD action, but requests that it be issued as an immediately adopted rule,
in light of the potential for serious injury to passengers and cabin crew members that is associated with exploding
water heaters and coffee makers. This commenter points out that AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01, amendment 39&hyph;8735
(58 FR 61618, November 22, 1993), addressed this same problem in other water heaters and coffee makers using the same
pressure relief valves, and it was made effective immediately, without prior opportunity for notice and public comment.
This commenter questions whether the unsafe condition is any ``less'' for the units addressed by the proposal than
for those addressed by AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01. The FAA responds by noting that the incident reports that prompted
the issuance of AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01 involved units equipped with an integral check valve; AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01
applies only to units with the integral check valve installation. At the time that AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01 was issued,
the FAA was in the process of evaluating the need for additional AD action to address other installations that incorporate
the same pressure relief valve design. The FAA found that Nordskog water heaters and coffee makers without the integral
check valve could use the same pressure relief valve in other applications and, therefore, could also be subject to
the same unsafe condition. However, because there had been no service history of incidents involving units without
the integral check valve, the FAA could not demonstrate that the safety concern was so critical that it should preclude
the opportunity for prior notice and public comment on this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters do not consider that AD action is appropriate to address a ``non-critical'' application of the subject
valve. These commenters point out that AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01 implemented the recommendations of Nordskog Service
Bulletin 93&hyph;34, which targeted the ``critical'' valve installations. However, the proposed AD would implement
the recommendations of Nordskog Service Bulletin 93&hyph;35, which addresses ``non-critical'' installations
of the valve. In light of this, the commenters contend that the AD is unnecessary. The FAA does not concur. The FAA acknowledges
that AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01 addresses units that incorporate the subject valve as an integral check valve, which
may be viewed as a ``critical'' application of the valve; it was a unit equipped with this integral check valve that
exploded during the incident that prompted issuance of that AD. However, as discussed in the previous comment, the
FAA has determined that water heaters and coffee makers that are not equipped with the integral check valve but use
the same pressure relief valve addressed by AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01, may also be subject to the same unsafe condition
addressed by that AD. Although the commenters may view the component design of the units addressed by this AD action
as ``less critical'' than those addressed by AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;01, the FAA has received no data to demonstrate that
the subject relief valve is not necessary to assure system safety. Therefore, the FAA considers this AD action to be
both appropriate and warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised the permit the installation of the discrepant NUPRO pressure
relief valve after the effective date of the AD and until the compliance time for inspection. This commenter points
out that proposed paragraph (b) would require that, as of the effective date of the rule, no operator would be allowed
to install a discrepant valve on any airplane; however, operators would have up to 12 months to remove any discrepant
valve that is currently installed on the airplane. The FAA does not concur in this case. Removing an unsafe condition
that already exists on an airplane necessarily involves performing maintenance on the airplane, and the FAA always
provides some kind of ``grace period'' in order to minimize disruption of operations. On the other hand, prohibiting
installation of spares that have been determined to create an unsafe condition does not require any additional maintenance
activity; it simply requires use of one part rather than another. In general, once an unsafe condition has been determined
to exist, it is the FAA's normal policy not to allow that condition to be introduced into the fleet. In developing the
technical information on which every AD is based, one of the important considerations is the availability of parts
that the AD will require to be installed. When it is determined that those (safe) parts are immediately available to
operators, it is the FAA's policy to prohibit installation of the unsafe parts after the effective date of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the FAA considers that the period of time between publication of the final rule AD in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the effective date of the final rule (usually 30 days) is sufficient to provide operators with an opportunity to
determine their immediate need for modified spares and to obtain them. Of course, in individual cases where this is
not possible, every AD contains a provision that allows an operator to obtain an extension of compliance time based
upon a specific showing of need. The FAA considers that this policy does increase safety and does not impose undue burdens
on operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter is concerned about the thermostat installed on the water heaters and coffee makers equipped with the
subject NUPRO pressure relief valves, and its involvement in the incident of explosion of the water heater. This commenter
assumes that the incident was the result of one of two possible failure paths: Either the thermostat failed closed
and the pressure relief valve failed closed; or the power relay failed closed and the pressure relief valve failed
closed. This commenter indicates that the proposed rule does not address these possible failure paths or the fact
that failures of the thermostat or relay are non-indicating by themselves. The FAA acknowledges that this commenter's
assumptions about the failure paths is reasonable. Although a failure other than that of the relief valve could not
be identified, some failure apparently occurred in the temperature control system to cause the pressure to build
up beyond its normal level. Generally, it is expected that the temperature control system will fail sometime during
its service life; the relief valve is in the system to address that failure. Although increased redundancy and failure
monitoring in the temperature control system would be two ways of improving system safety, those methods are not considered
necessary in this case. Replacement of the discrepant valve with the improved valve will address the failure scenario
that actually occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also is concerned about part identification of inserts in the affected water heaters and coffee makers,
and the need for a possible design change of NUPRO relief valves that have a common design type. Since these issues do
not directly concern this rulemaking action, the FAA has passed the commenter's suggestions on to the appropriate
manufacturer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is aware that the subject water heaters and coffee makers are installed in various airplanes. There are approximately
300 of these airplanes in the worldwide fleet, the FAA estimates that 200 airplanes are of U.S. registry. It will take
approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and the average labor rate is $55 per work
hour. (There are approximately 4 water heaters and/or coffee makers installed on each airplane.) The cost of required
parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $22,000, or $110 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this
action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 757 series airplanes,
that requires tests of the thrust reverser system, and repair, if necessary; installation of a modification that
would terminate those tests; and repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair, if necessary.
This amendment is prompted by results of a safety review, which revealed that in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser
could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 757 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51589). That action proposed to require tests of the thrust reverser system, and repair, if
necessary; installation of a modification that would terminate those tests; and repetitive operational checks
of that installation, and repair, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing requests that specific references to page numbers and revision dates of the Boeing 757 Airplane Maintenance
Manual (AMM) be eliminated from the proposed rule, and that the proposal be amended to include copies of the required
test procedures so that reference to the AMM would not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing explains that the AMM's are customized for each operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's
fleet. Therefore, the number of pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different equipment
configurations documented in an operator's AMM. Boeing also indicates that AMM procedures are revised periodically
for non-technical reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to accommodate
an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in addition to repagination, will necessitate
the issuance of revised AMM pages. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing states that the effect of specifying AMM page numbers and revision dates in the AD is that operators may be unable
to use the procedure contained in the AMM to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator would be required
to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance
with the AD that would allow the use of the current version of the AMM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the commenter, the FAA finds that specific AMM
page numbers and dates should not be specified in the final rule. Therefore, such references have been removed from
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final rule. However, for those paragraphs, the FAA does not agree that copies of
the specific procedures should be included in the final rule. Therefore, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the final
rule have been revised to cite only the appropriate section and task title specified in the AMM for accomplishment
of the tests required by those paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's objective in proposing periodic operational checks of the sync-lock device, as specified in paragraph
(c) of this AD, is to ensure the integrity of the locking function. However, subsequent to the issuance of the proposal
and the receipt of Boeing's comments to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for accomplishment
of the operational check of the sync-lock integrity. These procedures have been defined in paragraph (c) of the final
rule; therefore, the AMM references specified in paragraph (c) of the NPRM have been removed from the final rule. Additionally,
the procedures for the operational checks are accomplished independently of the other thrust reverser system tests
specified in the proposal. Accordingly, the FAA has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule to require periodic accomplishment
of operational checks of the sync-lock integrity only, and has removed the requirement for accomplishment of other
tests specified in that paragraph of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, states that, while ATA members are not opposed
to accomplishing the operational checks specified in paragraph (c) of the proposal as part of their maintenance programs,
these members are opposed to accomplishing the checks as part of the requirements of an AD. The commenters believe
that the adoption of paragraph (c), as proposed, is equivalent to issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements
(CMR) item by means of an AD. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement for operational checks in the
AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the checks should be provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative
is justified because no data exist to show that repetitive checks of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled adequately
through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing
the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA- approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational
check of the sync-lock. The initial check would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after modification.
The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators
choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) 91.417 or 121.380 (14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal
Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, Boeing, requests that the proposed requirement for operational checks be removed from the AD until
the FAA reviews the ``more comprehensive'' scheduled maintenance recommendations developed by the Model 757/767
Thrust Reverser Working Group, which will be recommended in the next revision to the Maintenance Review Board (MRB)
report. Boeing believes that adoption of the maintenance recommendations contained in that forthcoming revision
will ensure that an adequate level of safety (with regard to the sync-lock installation) will be maintained by all
operators of Model 757 series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes the concerns of these commenters regarding the requirement for periodic operational checks of
the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA finds that the operational checks are necessary in order
to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required
by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure
adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives
of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives
from other organizations, such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from
the recommendations of the task force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges that the operational checks specified in this AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled
maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock
to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational checks is necessary
in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe condition. This determination
is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service
experience. In addition, service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock
that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in activation of the
sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested alternative to accomplishment of the operational checks would
permit each operator to determine whether and how often these checks should be conducted. In light of the severity
of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate
at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish checks of the integrity of the sync-lock
installation in a common manner and at common intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also finds that addressing operational checks of the sync-lock integrity in a recommended action, such as
an MRB report, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust reverser system. However, the
FAA recognizes that an operational check interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service, which will be recommended by Boeing
for inclusion in the next revision to the MRB report, corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected
operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours
time-in-service for accomplishment of repetitive operational checks. In light of the safety implications of the
unsafe condition addressed and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational checks of the fleet during
regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be readily available,
the FAA finds that accomplishment of the checks at intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable
level of safety. Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Boeing has issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035,
dated June 23, 1994. The service bulletin revision moves general work instruction Step B from Work Package 2 to Step
Q in Work Package 8. In Revision 1 of the service bulletin, Step B of Work Package 2 specified procedures for removal
of the ground to the EICAS for the REV ISLN VAL message; however, the ground should not be removed as part of Work Package
2. Rather, the ground should be removed as part of Work Package 8 in order to avoid loss of the REV ISLN VAL message on EICAS.
Revision 2 of the service bulletin correctly describes procedures for removal of the ground as part of Work Package
8. Revision 2 of the service bulletin also describes procedures for installation of an additional bracket on the P36
disconnect bracket and to make a cutout on the P37 disconnect bracket on certain airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved this latest revision to the service bulletin and has revised the final rule to reflect
it as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA finds that citing this latest revision to the service
bulletin will impose no additional burden on any operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that Revision 2 of Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035 references Rolls-Royce Service
Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725 and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 as additional sources of service information
for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation. However, the Boeing service bulletin does
not specify the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added
``NOTE 1'' to paragraph (b) of this AD to specify that the intent of that paragraph is that the appropriate revision
levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins that are to be used in conjunction with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035
are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated
January 7, 1994; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1,
dated October 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, since the issuance of the proposed rule, Rolls-Royce has issued Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822,
dated October 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for installation of a revised thrust reverser
sync-lock. The FAA has determined that accomplishment of the actions described in this service bulletin, in conjunction
with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035 [which was cited in paragraph (b) of the proposal as the appropriate
source of service information for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature], constitutes
an acceptable alternative to the sync-lock installation specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal.

In light of this information, paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to include paragraph (b)(1), which contains
the requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature that was specified in the
proposed rule, and paragraph (b)(2), which provides for installation of a revised thrust reverser sync-lock as an
acceptable alternative to paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. Accomplishment of the revised installation specified in
paragraph (b)(2) requires no additional work hours beyond the 514 work hours specified in the economic impact information,
below, for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation.

Additionally, it should be noted that Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 references Rolls-Royce

with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535C engines. Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 references
Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725 as an additional source of service information. However,
the appropriate revision levels for these service bulletins are not specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035
or in any of the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 2'' to paragraph (b) of the final
rule to specify that the appropriate revision levels for Rolls-Royce Service Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726
and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822,
are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated
October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1,
dated January 7, 1994.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 40 Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. Currently, there
are no Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design on the U.S. Register. However, should an affected airplane
be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish
the required auto restow and integrity tests, 514 work hours per airplane to accomplish either modification specified
in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this AD, and 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required operational checks;
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts are currently planned to be supplied by the manufacturer
at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD is estimated to be $28,380 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper)
PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes. This action requires installing a certain nose landing gear modification
kit. Several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on the affected airplanes prompted this action. In
particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4&hyph;20) connecting the lower drag link of the nosegear
to the upper drag link. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent nose gear collapse because of AN4&hyph;20
bolt failure, which could lead to airplane damage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain
Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8879). The action proposed to require installing Nose Landing Gear Modification Kit, Piper
part number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(P/N) 764&hyph;377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) or Piper P/N 764&hyph;378 (for PA44 series airplanes).
The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions included with these kits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposal and requests that the FAA reference Piper Service Letter (SL) 988, dated July
29, 1986. The commenter states that Piper SL 988 includes a statement of FAA-approval of the referenced kits and the
instructions to the kits does not include this statement. The FAA concurs that the statement of FAA-approval is included
in the service letter, and that for informational purposes, reference should be given to Piper SL 988 in the AD. The
FAA has added a note to the final rule referencing this service letter. The actions are still required to be accomplished
in accordance with the kit instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the addition of the above-referenced note and minor editorial
corrections. The FAA has determined that this addition and any minor corrections will not change the meaning of the
AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 6,888 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
6 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an
hour. Parts cost approximately $52 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $2,631,216. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has
accomplished the required action. The FAA believes that some airplane owners have already accomplished the required
actions. With this in mind, the FAA anticipates that the cost of this AD will be much lower than the figure referenced
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for
this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location
provided under the caption

History

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E Airspace at Rogers, AR, and Bentonville, AR, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 62058). Numerous users had requested additional services such as SID's and Siap's at these airports. Therefore,
in order to provide for these additional services, controlled airspace extending upward from the surface of these
airports that are without an operating control tower, is needed for IFR operations. The proposal was to establish
Class E airspace, extending upward from the surface, for IFR operations at Rogers, AR, and Bentonville, AR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. The latitude and longitude coordinates have been updated to reflect
current data. Therefore, other than the changes just discussed and editorial changes, this amendment is adopted
as proposed in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace area designated as
a surface area for an airport are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace located at Rogers, AR,
and Bentonville, AR, to provide controlled airspace upward from the surface to contain IFR operations at these airports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This final rule extends, for a period not to exceed an additional 6 years, the existing arrangement under which a public
housing agency or Indian housing authority (hereinafter referred to collectively as ``HAs'') may share equally
with the Department any cost reductions due to the differences between projected and actual utility rates in the first
year that the reductions occur. The rate savings must be directly related to the actions of the HA and must be cost effective.
In addition, the rule eliminates the need for a waiver before operating subsidy may be paid for certain units approved
for nondwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services and anti-drug activities.

Background on Shared Utility Rate Savings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9(a)(3)(B)(i) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g) (the ``1937 Act'') provides that
under the performance funding system in the first year that the reductions occur, any public housing agency shall
share equally with the Department any cost reductions due to the differences between projected and actual utility
rates attributable to actions taken by the agency which lead to such reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 114(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992)
(the ``1992 Act'') amended section 9(a)(3)(B)(i) of the 1937 Act to provide that in subsequent years, the Secretary
may continue, with regard to energy savings, the sharing arrangement with the public housing agency for an additional
6 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of section 201(b)(1) of the 1937 Act, the provisions of Title I of the 1937 Act apply to low-income housing
developed or operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and an Indian housing authority. Therefore, the
shared savings provisions under section 9(a)(3)(B)(i) extend to Indian housing authorities. However, under section
201(b)(2) no provision of Title I, or amendment to Title I, that is enacted after the date of enactment of the Indian
Housing Act of 1988 (June 29, 1988) shall apply to public housing developed or operated pursuant to a contract between
the Secretary and an Indian housing authority unless the provision explicitly provides for applicability. Therefore,
absent such a provision, section 114(c) of the 1992 Act does not extend to Indian housing authorities. The Department,
however, as matter of policy, is extending the shared savings arrangement to Indian housing authorities also. Not
to do so would frustrate the goals of providing incentives to undertake energy conservation activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utility rate reduction measures include wellhead purchases of natural gas and administrative appeals or legal action
beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings. It is important that an extension of the shared savings
term provide adequate incentives and cover the increased administrative expense involved in undertaking energy
conservation activities as sophisticated as a wellhead purchase program. The Department has a manifold interest
in promoting the most economical purchasing arrangements in order to reduce the need for operating subsidies. There
is, first and foremost, a national interest in reducing consumption of non-replaceable energy resources, and a parallel
interest in making sure that energy resources are purchased economically and efficiently. In the context of the housing
assistance programs, HUD is obliged to honor these over-all goals by encouraging energy conservation in assisted
housing environments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 6, 1991, the Department published a proposed rule that would have established new conditions under which
a PHA or an IHA could have included vacant units in its computation of eligibility for operating subsidy. The comment
period for this proposed rule was reopened on June 22, 1992 (57 FR 27716). Ultimately, as a result of congressional
action, the proposed rule was not pursued to a final rule. See, Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban
Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 29, 1991;
106 Stat. 757), and section 114(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved
October 28, 1992; 106 Stat. 3691). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of the provisions contained in the proposed rule were opposed by commenters. However, the aspect of the proposed
rule that would permit the payment of operating subsidy, under certain conditions, for units approved for nondwelling
use for economic self-sufficiency and anti-drug activities was not controversial. The comments received on this
aspect generally supported the proposed rule, but urged the Department to adopt an even more generous treatment of
nondwelling space in the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility. However, in this final rule the Department
is adopting only the provisions that appeared in the proposed rule, and only to the extent that those provisions reflect
the existing practice. The Department is clarifying in &sect;&sect;905.720(b)(2) and 990.198(b)(2) that an IHA
or PHA need demonstrate only that non-utility operating costs are not available from other funding. This conforms
to existing practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Department is permitting PHAs and IHAs to continue receiving operating subsidy for units that are
no longer available for occupancy because they have been removed from the rent roll and approved for economic self-sufficiency
and anti-drug activities. Under Notice PIH 90&hyph;39 (PHA) (issued August 24, 1990), a PHA or an IHA may request a
waiver to allow consideration of such units in its calculation of operating subsidy eligibility. Therefore, the
effect of the revisions to &sect;&sect;905.720 and 990.108(b) in this final rule is not to change current treatment
of these units in the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility, but merely to reduce the administrative burdens
of all parties involved in the waiver process.

This Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing regulation on shared utility rate savings provides an incentive to HAs to implement utilities conservation
programs, particularly rate-savings programs like wellhead purchase, when calculating eligibility for operating
subsidy under the Performance Funding System, but limits the effect of that incentive to one year. This revision to
the regulation does not change the mechanism for granting the incentive, but extends the authorization for the shared
savings arrangement up to an additional six years. HUD will continue to require that the HA be able to demonstrate in
each annual budget that there are real rate reduction savings in each of the years for which the extended incentive
applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the revisions in this rule will eliminate the need to seek a waiver to permit the payment of operating subsidy
for certain units approved for nondwelling use for economic self-sufficiency and anti-drug activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve the regulatory goals discussed above, this rule amends 24 CFR 905.715(b)(2), 905.720(b), 905.730(c),
990.107(b)(2), 990.108(b), and 990.110(c)(1)(i).

Justification for Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest
before making this rule effective because it is an extension of an ongoing policy which rewards a HA for its action to
secure a reduction in utility rates.

(2) Units approved for nondwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services and anti-drug activities
are eligible for operating subsidy under the conditions provided in this paragraph (b)(2), and the costs attributable
to them are to be included in the operating budget. If a unit satisfies the conditions stated in paragraphs (b)(2) (i)
through (v) of this section, it will be eligible for subsidy at the rate of the AEL for the number of months the unit is
devoted to such use. Approval will be given for a period of no more than three years. Renewal of the approval to allow
payments after that period may be made only if the IHA can demonstrate that no other sources for paying the non-utility
operating costs of the unit are available: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The unit must be used for either economic self-sufficiency activities directly related to maximizing the number
of employed residents or for anti-drug programs directly related to ridding the development of illegal drugs and
drug-related crime. The activities must be directed toward and for the benefit of residents of the development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The IHA must demonstrate that space for the service or program is not available elsewhere in the locality and that
the space used is safe and suitable for its intended use or that resources are committed to make the space safe and suitable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The IHA must demonstrate satisfactorily that other funding is not available to pay for the non-utility operating
costs. All rental income generated as a result of the activity must be reported as income in the operating subsidy calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Operating subsidy may be approved for only one site (involving one or more contiguous units) per Indian housing
development for economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs, and the number of units involved should
be the minimum necessary to support the service or program. Operating subsidy for any additional sites per development
can only be approved by HUD Headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The IHA must submit a certification with its Performance Funding System Calculation that the units are being used
for the purpose for which they were approved and that any rental income generated as a result of the activity is reported
as income in the operating subsidy calculation. The IHA must maintain specific documentation of the units covered.
Such documentation should include a listing of the units, the street addresses, and project/management control
numbers.

utilities, such as water, fuel oil, electricity, and gas, is directly attributable to action by the IHA, such as wellhead
purchase of natural gas, or administrative appeals or legal action beyond normal public participation in rate-making
proceedings, then the IHA will be permitted to retain one-half of the cost savings attributable to its actions for
the first year and, upon determination that the action was cost-effective in the first year, for up to an additional
six years, as long as the actions continue to be cost-effective, and the other one-half of the cost savings will be deducted
from operating subsidy otherwise payable.

(2) Units approved for nondwelling use to promote economic self-sufficiency services and anti-drug activities
are eligible for operating subsidy under the conditions provided in this paragraph (b)(2), and the costs attributable
to them are to be included in the operating budget. If a unit satisfies the conditions stated in paragraphs (b)(2) (i)
through (v) of this section, it will be eligible for subsidy at the rate of the AEL for the number of months the unit is
devoted to such use. Approval will be given for a period of no more than three years. Renewal of the approval to allow
payments after that period may be made only if the PHA can demonstrate that no other sources for paying the non-utility
operating costs of the unit are available:

(i) The unit must be used for either economic self-sufficiency activities directly related to maximizing the number
of employed residents or for anti-drug programs directly related to ridding the development of illegal drugs and
drug-related crime. The activities must be directed toward and for the benefit of residents of the development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The PHA must demonstrate that space for the service or program is not available elsewhere in the locality and that
the space used is safe and suitable for its intended use or that the resources are committed to make the space safe and
suitable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The PHA must demonstrate satisfactorily that other funding is not available to pay for the non-utility operating
costs. All rental income generated as a result of the activity must be reported as income in the operating subsidy calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Operating subsidy may be approved for only one site (involving one or more contiguous units) per public housing
development for economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs, and the number of units involved should
be the minimum necessary to support the service or program. Operating subsidy for any additional sites per development
can only be approved by HUD Headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The PHA must submit a certification with its Performance Funding System Calculation that the units are being used
for the purpose for which they were approved and that any rental income generated as a result of the activity is reported
as income in the operating subsidy calculation. The PHA must maintain specific documentation of the units covered.
Such documentation should include a listing of the units, the street addresses, and project/management control
numbers.

utilities, such as water, fuel oil, electricity, and gas, is directly attributable to action by the PHA, such as wellhead
purchase of natural gas, or administrative appeals or legal action beyond normal public participation in rate-making
proceedings, then the PHA will be permitted to retain one-half of the cost savings attributable to its actions for
the first year and, upon determination that the action was cost-effective in the first year, for up to an additional
six years, as long as the actions continue to be cost-effective, and the other one-half of the cost savings will be deducted
from operating subsidy otherwise payable.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4081 was amended to apply to diesel fuel by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Temporary regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the diesel fuel excise tax imposed by section 4081 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 30, 1993, (58 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 63069) along with a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;52&hyph;93) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-referencing the temporary regulations (58 FR 63131). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments to these temporary regulations (relating to dye color 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and concentration) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 27, 1993, (58 FR 68304) along with a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (PS&hyph;76&hyph;93) cross-referencing those amendments (58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68338).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments responding to these notices were received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a public hearing was held on March 22, 1994. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the comments relating to the exemption from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel tax imposed by section 4081, &sect;48.4082&hyph;1 (as proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in PS&hyph;52&hyph;93 and PS&hyph;76&hyph;93) is adopted as revised by this Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments and revisions are discussed below. Other sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed and temporary regulations remain in force until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations on those topics are issued.

Existing IRS and EPA Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective October 1, 1993, Environmental Protection Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EPA) regulations (40 CFR 80.29) make it unlawful for any person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to manufacture, sell, supply, offer for sale or supply, dispense, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport, or introduce into commerce diesel fuel that contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of sulfur in excess of 0.05 percent (by weight) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(high-sulfur diesel fuel) unless the fuel contains visible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of the blue dye 1,4 dialkylamino-anthraquinone. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial penalty applies to the use of high-sulfur diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective January 1, 1994, the Federal excise tax on diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel imposed by section 4081 does not apply to removals of diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel that is indelibly dyed (or dyed and marked) in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with IRS regulations. Section 48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of the Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Retailers Excise Tax Regulations and a transitional rule in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice 94&hyph;21, 1994&hyph;11 Internal Revenue Bulletin 32, provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel that is required to be dyed blue pursuant to EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-sulfur diesel fuel program satisfies the IRS dyeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement only if it contains blue dye of the prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration level. Diesel fuel that is not required to be dyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blue pursuant to EPA's high-sulfur diesel fuel program satisfies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the IRS dyeing requirement only if it contains a red dye of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed type and concentration. In addition, the Commissioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is given authority to modify the dyeing requirements by approving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of other dyes.

Safety Issues Regarding Aviation Gasoline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No Federal regulations require the dyeing of aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline (avgas). However, avgas is dyed by refiners to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiate various grades of the fuel and to distinguish avgas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from clear, kerosene-based jet fuel. As a result of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice, more than 90 percent of domestic avgas is dyed blue or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
green. Extensive training has been conducted within the aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community to assure that pilots, mechanics, fuel service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel, and vendors are thoroughly familiar with the meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and use of color in fuels. This training is important because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of avgas by even small amounts of other fuel can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause an engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Aviation Administration, EPA, and IRS are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that blue-dyed diesel fuel might be mistaken for blue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or green avgas. Of particular concern is the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misfuelings in remote locations where fuels are dispensed into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonstandard containers or where different fuels are stored in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar containers in close proximity to each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IRS received comments from refiners, pipeline and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal operators, and others in the diesel fuel distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system concerning the dye color and concentration requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temporary and proposed regulations. In general, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments suggested that the blue dye concentration level should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be lower than that scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the red dye concentration should be lower than the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement (3.9 pounds per thousand barrels (ptb) when expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a solid dye standard). The comments expressed concern that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required concentration level might cause sedimentation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pipelines and engines and make the petroleum industry's tests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cloud point and haze more difficult to conduct. A comment from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dye manufacturer indicated, however, that the required red dye is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completely soluble in fuel and noted that an independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory had no difficulty in conducting the cloud point and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
haze test. The IRS carefully considered these public comments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the final regulations.

IRS Concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to its concerns about aviation safety, the IRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that enforcement of the diesel fuel excise tax will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired unless the dye in fuel is visible when that fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diluted as part of any practicable plan of large-scale tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evasion. In determining the appropriate dye color and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration requirements to address this concern, the IRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected numerous samples of diesel fuel containing various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colors and concentrations of dye. Many of these samples were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently produced by the IRS and others were provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum industry and dye manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Final Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to avoid any possible confusion with blue or green 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avgas, these final regulations provide that beginning October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, diesel fuel can no longer be dyed blue for tax exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. Rather, red dye will be used to identify all tax-exempt diesel fuel, regardless of the sulfur content of
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel. The Commissioner will retain the authority to modify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement by approving the use of other dyes, but will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the use of dyes that could cause diesel fuel to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mistaken for avgas. In addition, a transitional rule will permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax-free removals of high-sulfur diesel fuel that was dyed blue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The red dye concentration required by the final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the equivalent of the red dye concentration currently required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by IRS for tax-exempt low-sulfur diesel fuel. In the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, however, the required red dye concentration is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed in terms of a solid dye standard, which is uniform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among dye manufacturers, rather than in terms of the dye's active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. This change does not impose any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on diesel fuel that was dyed red under the rules in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect before the issuance of the final regulations. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel that was dyed red in accordance with those rules will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the solid dye standard in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its inspection of dyed diesel fuel samples, the IRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes the 3.9 ptb concentration required by the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is necessary to address its concerns regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution. In many cases involving the diesel fuel dyed with less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 3.9 ptb, the dye was not visible when the fuel was diluted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, a required concentration level of less than 3.9 ptb could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in considerable diesel fuel tax evasion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS understands the petroleum industry's concerns on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration issue and will continue to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the 3.9 ptb standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Action by EPA

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with these IRS final regulations, EPA is

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require high-sulfur diesel fuel to be dyed red rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
blue. The EPA rule and the IRS rule have the same effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 31, 1994, OSHA issued a new standard addressing the work practices to be used during the operation and maintenance
of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. In that document, OSHA also revised the
electrical protective equipment requirements contained in the General Industry Standards.

I. Correction of the Preamble: Clothing for Employees Working On or Near Exposed Energized Parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (l)(6)(iii) of &sect;1910.269 prohibits employees exposed to flames or arcs from wearing clothing that,
when exposed to flames or arcs, could increase the extent of injury that would be sustained by the employees. In adopting
this requirement in the final rule, OSHA relied on the evidence submitted to the record in determining what clothing
would or would not be acceptable under the language of paragraph (l)(6)(iii). The preamble to the final rule discussed
a portion of this evidence as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement is intended to prohibit the types of fabrics shown in the Duke Power Company videotape to be expected
to cause more severe injuries than would otherwise be anticipated. These include such untreated materials as polyester
and rayon, unless the employee is otherwise protected from the effects of their burning. Natural fabrics, such as
100 percent cotton or wool, and synthetic materials that are flame resistant or flame retardant are acceptable under
the final rule. (If and when a national consensus standard on clothing for electrical workers becomes available,
OSHA will examine whether or not to revise the rule to require materials conforming to such a standard.) [59 FR 4389]

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is clear from this discussion that OSHA relied heavily on the videotape produced by Duke Power Company and on the
results of arc tests on clothing as shown in the videotape in its finding that clothing made from certain fabrics was
prohibited and that clothing made from other fabrics was acceptable. It is also quite clear from the preamble quotation
that the Agency intended the final rule ``to prohibit the types of fabrics shown in the Duke Power Company videotape
to be expected to cause more severe injuries than would otherwise be anticipated.'' However, later in that same quotation,
OSHA stated that ``natural fabrics, such as 100 percent cotton or wool, and synthetic materials that are flame resistant
or flame retardant are acceptable under the final rule.'' Several questions have been raised in the period after the
promulgation of the rule in regard to this statement in the preamble. Interested parties have pointed out that the
Duke videotape stated specifically:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All the heavyweight natural fibers we tested performed well. Natural fibers are those found in nature, such as cotton,
wool, silk, and linen. We did little testing with silk and linen since most people wouldn't wear them while doing electrical
work, but we performed extensive tests with cottons and wools. Lightweight cottons and wools sometimes burned, but
without the melting and sticking of synthetics. Heavyweight cottons, wools, and blends of the two did not burn. They
actually seemed to insulate whatever they were covering from the heat of the arc. Heavyweight means that a material
weighs at least 11 ounces per yard, like the fabric in a denim jacket.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA wrote &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii) in performance-oriented language. That language prohibits any clothing
that, when exposed to flame or arc, could increase the extent of injury sustained by an employee. Although the record
that was in place when final &sect;1910.269 was adopted did not provide sufficient information for the adoption of
a rule specifying clothing that would actually protect an employee from both flames and arcs, the Agency concluded
that the record did support a rule prohibiting clothing that could further injure a worker. In other words, OSHA adopted
a rule that addresses whether or not the clothing worn by a worker would contribute to injury rather than a rule requiring
personal protective equipment. As a result, to determine whether clothing made from a given material meets the standard,
OSHA need only ascertain whether that material will ignite and continue to burn under the conditions to which an employee
is exposed. If, under these conditions, a material will ignite and will continue to burn in the absence of an ignition
source, then clothing made from such material is prohibited by &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii), unless the clothing
is worn in such a manner as to eliminate the hazard involved.

The Duke videotape, which was the primary basis for OSHA's determination that clothing made from certain types of
fabrics should be prohibited whenever an employee is exposed to the hazards of electric arc, states that clothing
made from 11-ounce cotton would not ignite under the conditions present during their arc tests. Clothing made from
lesser weights of cotton could ignite and, once ignited, would continue to burn after the arc ceased. Clearly, from
this evidence in the rulemaking record, clothing made from cotton of less than 11 ounces will not meet the performance
criteria given in the standard for employees exposed to conditions comparable to those in the Duke Power Company tests.

 Cotton of 11 ounces or more will not ignite and therefore does meet the requirement in &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii)
under the arc test conditions.

The conditions present during the Duke Power Company tests involved an 3800-ampere, 12-inch (approximate) electric
arc that was approximately 12 inches from the material. The arc lasted for 10 cycles, or 0.167 seconds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of this evidence in the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that clothing made from 100 percent cotton
or wool will be acceptable if its weight is appropriate for the flame and electric arc conditions to which an employee
could be exposed. Employers must make a determination of whether or not 100 percent cotton or wool clothing worn by
a worker is acceptable under the conditions to which he or she could be exposed. The factors employers must consider
in making this determination are: The weight of the material; the available current involved; the duration of exposure;
the distance from any possible flames or arcs that might occur; and the presence of other flammable materials (such
as flammable hydraulic fluid) that could be ignited in the presence of an arc and, in turn, ignite the clothing. Later
in this document, OSHA is correcting the quoted sentence in the preamble to the final rule in order to clarify the Agency's
intent in this matter. (It should be noted that OSHA is not revising either the rule in paragraph (l)(6)(iii) or the
note following that paragraph. The fabrics listed in that note continue to be prohibited.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clothing made from flame-retardant or flame-resistant materials is acceptable under the rule. Employers are encouraged
to ensure that their employees wear such clothing if they will be exposed to the hazard of flame or electric arc. In this
regard, it should also be noted that the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has adopted a new standard,
ASTM F1506&hyph;1994, for clothing to be worn for the protection of electrical workers who could be exposed to the
hazard of flame or electric arc. This standard, which has not yet incorporated an arc-resistance test, requires the
fabric used in clothing to pass a vertical flame test (that is, the fabric must be flame retardant or flame resistant).
In fact, when OSHA revises &sect;1910.269 or its counterpart in the Construction Standards (Subpart V of Part 1926),
the Agency will be required under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) to adopt a rule that, if it
differs substantially from the ASTM standard, must better effectuate the purposes of the OSH Act than that consensus
standard. Employers should keep these facts in mind when adopting rules relating to the clothing worn by their electric
power generation, transmission, and distribution employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA will continue to encourage ASTM Committee F18 (the committee responsible for ASTM F 1506) to expedite their research
and standards development activities with regard to protective clothing worn by electrical workers. The Agency
will use the latest information available from the committee and from other sources in revising &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii)
in the future.

The electrical protective equipment standard and the electric power generation, transmission, and distribution
standard, except &sect;1910.269(a)(2), became effective on May 31, 1994. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) petitioned
OSHA to delay the effective date of certain requirements of these two standards until January 31, 1995, when the training
requirements of &sect;1910.269(a)(2) become effective. It said that several provisions require the purchase of
equipment that is not in sufficient supply for the entire universe of affected employers. EEI also contended that
other provisions require the modification of equipment or installations and that employers will need more than the
120 days given in the notice of rulemaking to make these modifications. It asserted that still other requirements
entail significant departure from normal company practice and that detailed training is required to implement these
requirements. The general training requirements, it noted, do not become effective until January 31, 1995. Lastly,
it maintained that employers need more time to consult with OSHA to determine exactly what practices and procedures
are acceptable under the new standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has reviewed EEI's petition for delay in the effective date and has found it justified, in part. With respect to
EEI's petition regarding requirements that necessitate the purchase of equipment that is in short supply, the Agency
finds that it is unnecessary to provide any delay in enforcement of these requirements. It is OSHA policy to accept
purchase orders dated before the effective date of a standard to be evidence of intent to comply with that standard.
In such cases, the Agency does not issue citations or impose penalties on companies that have ordered but not yet received
goods that are intended for compliance with OSHA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A stay will be necessary for provisions requiring significant modifications in equipment or installations. If an
alteration is necessary, these requirements will force an employer to plan and design the modification, purchase
any necessary materials, and then install the appropriate modification. These adjustments will normally take more
than the 120 days given in the notice of rulemaking to put into place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEI has identified one provision requiring modifications to existing coal-handling installations that will take
up to 2 years for employers to effectuate. Paragraph (v)(11)(xii) of &sect;1910.269 requires sources of ignition
to be eliminated or controlled so as to prevent the ignition of combustible atmospheres associated with coal-handling
operations. EEI argues that extensive modifications will be necessary at many older power plants and that these changes
will take up to 2 years to put into place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a stay of enforcement of &sect;1910.269(v)(11)(xii) is granted until February 1, 1996, and a stay of enforcement
of the following paragraphs of &sect;1910.269 is granted until November 1, 1994:

With respect to provisions that entail extensive changes in work practices or procedures necessitating substantial
retraining of employees, OSHA agrees to delay enforcement until the training for any new practices or procedures
can be completed for all affected employees. Having some employees, who have been trained in a new procedure, use that
procedure while other employees, who are not familiar with the new procedure, use other work methods could provide
less safety. For example, the lockout and tagging requirements of &sect;1910.269(d) necessitate the adoption of
specific procedures for the control of hazardous energy sources. OSHA anticipates that some employers will need
to modify existing lockout and tagging procedures to effect compliance with paragraph (d). Although the Agency believes
that most affected employers are already using programs for the control of hazardous energy sources, some employers
may need to modify their practices to comply with the final rule and to protect their employees fully. However, if those
modifications are put into effect before all employees have been trained in their use, errors and injuries could result.
Additionally, some of the provisions that EEI identified as requiring substantial training efforts are specific
training requirements. For example, &sect;1910.269(e)(2) requires employees to be trained in the hazards of enclosed
space entry, in enclosed space entry procedures, and in enclosed space rescue procedures. These provisions will
also take longer than 120 days to implement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for this reason, OSHA is staying the enforcement of the following paragraphs of &sect;1910.269 until
November 1, 1994:

The remaining requirements for which EEI requested delay are those that it claims will need additional consultation
with OSHA so that employers will know exactly what is required by the standard. Because the standard is written in terms
of performance, rather than in terms specifying the means of compliance, employers are given flexibility in meeting
the standard. However, sometimes it may not be clear whether or not a given method will comply with an individual provision.
For example, employers will likely need more time to identify the types of clothing that will be acceptable under &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Several provisions in &sect;1910.269 contained minor typographical or grammatical errors. Additionally, several
national consensus standards were approved and published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and
by ASTM shortly after the promulgation of revised &sect;1910.137 and &sect;1910.269. Some non-mandatory notes
and a non-mandatory appendix contained references to older editions of these ASTM standards. These non-mandatory
references are intended to provide employers, employees, and other affected parties with additional information
on techniques of complying with the OSHA rules. In fact, two notes in &sect;1910.137 accept compliance with specific
ASTM standards as being compliance with &sect;1910.137. The Agency has reviewed the new ANSI and ASTM standards and
has found them to provide newer, more technically up-to-date information than the older versions. Therefore, this
correction notice is updating the references in &sect;1910.137 and &sect;1910.269 to the later ANSI and ASTM standards.
In &sect;1910.137, OSHA is retaining the slightly older editions of the ASTM standards, in addition to the more recent
editions, to clarify that electrical protective equipment manufactured in accordance with the older standards
is still acceptable.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation recently issued a final rule that amended its regulations for the reduction
or waiver of complete withdrawal liability by prescribing a procedure and standards for amending a multiemployer
plan to provide alternative rules. Under the amended regulations, an amendment adopting such alternative rules
may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC. This technical amendment adds the control number assigned by
the Office of Management and Budget to the collection of information in the amended regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs
under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Part 2647 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR Part 2647), Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability, implements
ERISA section 4207 (29 U.S.C. 1387) by providing rules for reducing or waiving the liability for complete withdrawal
of an employer that subsequently resumes covered operations under or renews an obligation to contribute under a multiemployer
plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended on March 2, 1994 (59 FR 9926; effective April 1, 1994), Part 2647 includes, in &sect;2647.9 (Plan rules for
abatement), a procedure and standards for the amendment of a multiemployer plan to provide alternative rules for
the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability. An amendment adopting such alternative rules (and any
subsequent modification thereof) may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC (&sect;2647.9(a)), and &sect;2647.9(d)
prescribes the information that a plan sponsor (or duly authorized representative thereof) must include in its request
for PBGC approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') approved the collection of
information in &sect;2647.9 under control number 1212&hyph;0044 (expiration date: September 30, 1994), and the
PBGC is not issuing this technical amendment to display the OMB control number at the end of &sect;2647.9. (A notice
of the PBGC's request that OMB extend approval of this collection of information for another three years appears elsewhere
in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rule is limited to a technical change, the PBGC has for good cause found advance notice and public procedure
thereon to be unnecessary under section 553 (b)(B) and (d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B)
and (d)(3)). Therefore, the PBGC is issuing this amendment as a final rule, effective upon publication.

E.O. 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productively, competition, jobs, the environment, public
health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing the approval of a proposed amendment to the Alabama Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Plan
(hereinafter referred to as the Alabama Plan) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA),
30 U.S.C. 1231 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., as amended. Alabama proposed revising its procedures for ranking and selecting abandoned mine land reclamation
projects and procedures for obtaining right-of-entry by changing the eligibility date for abandoned mine land reclamation.
Alabama also revised its statutory definition of ``abandoned mine lands.'' The amendment is intended to meet the
requirements of Title IV and the Federal regulations.

., establishes an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources adversely affected
by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977,
lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in
an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility
under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, Title IV, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990,
effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C., 1231 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation
of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond
forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977,
and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the
bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR program has the responsibility and primary authority
to implement the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of the Interior approved the Alabama AMLR Plan on May 20, 1982. Information pertinent to the general
background, revisions, and amendments to the initial plan submission, as well as the Secretary's findings and the
disposition of comments can be found in the May 20, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 22062). Actions taken subsequent to the approval of the Alabama AMLR Plan are identified at 30 CFR 901.20 and
901.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope or major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.13
in approving or disapproving an amendment or revision.

II. Submission of Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 1, 1993, Alabama submitted a reclamation plan amendment to OSM (Administrative Record No.
AL&hyph;0504). The proposed amendment consists of revised narratives to replace portions of the approved Alabama
Plan as provided for by 30 CFR 884.13. The Alabama Plan was revised to change the eligibility date for AMLR reclamation
from August 3, 1977, to November 5, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the October 21, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 54313) and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on November 22, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to: a) the State's lack of specificity in proposing
to extend eligibility to sites mined and abandoned prior to November 5, 1990; and b) the State's plan to extend emergency
eligibility to sites mined after August 3, 1977. OSM notified Alabama of these concerns by letter dated January 27,
1994 (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;508). Alabama responded in a letter dated April 5, 1994 (Administrative
Record No. AL&hyph;509), by submitting a revised amendment. The revised amendment includes specific language describing
those sites eligible for abandoned mine land reclamation. The proposed change of date in Alabama's emergency program
section of the AMLR Plan was withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the revisions to the proposed amendment submitted by Alabama, OSM reopened the public comment period in the

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 884.14 and 885.15, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment submitted on October 1, 1993, and revised on April 5, 1994. Revisions not specifically
discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations
to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment.

1. Procedures for Ranking and Selecting/Landowner's Guide to Reclamation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alabama is proposing to revise its ranking and selection procedures for abandoned mine land reclamation projects
and right of entry procedures as provided in the reclamation guidelines for landowners by extending abandoned mine
land eligibility to sites mined after August 3, 1977. Those sites would include: a) sites mined during the period beginning
on August 4, 1977, and ending on or before May 20, 1982, for which funds for reclamation or abatement pursuant to a bond
or other form of financial guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation
or abatement; or b) sites mined during the period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on or before November 5, 1990,
and for which the surety of the mining operator became insolvent and there were not sufficient funds to provide for
adequate reclamation or abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed State revisions pertaining to ranking and selection and landowner's guidelines to reclamation are
substantively identical to section 402(g)(4)(B) (i) and (ii) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds the proposed
State rules no less effective than the Federal rules at section 402(g)(4)(B) (i) and (ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Senate Bill 162_Definition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In section 9&hyph;16&hyph;121 of Senate bill 162, Alabama revised the statutory definition of ``abandoned mine
lands'' to include certain lands affected by the mining of coal prior to November 5, 1990. In section 9&hyph;16&hyph;124,
Alabama defined lands and water eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures as those which were
mined for coal or which were affected by the mining or coal mining processes, and abandoned or left in an inadequate
reclamation status prior to November 5, 1990, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under
existing State or Federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Federal rules do not contain a definition of ``abandoned mine lands,'' section 404 of SMCRA defines eligible
lands and water. Further, section 402(g)(4) of SMCRA specifies certain criteria which sites must satisfy in order
to meet AML eligibility requirements. Although Alabama's statutory language lacks the specificity of section 402(g)(4)
of SMCRA, the Alabama Plan is being revised, as discussed in Finding 1, to include the more restrictive language provided
by SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds the revised definitions in Senate Bill 162 not inconsistent with the Federal
rules at sections 402(g)(4) and 404 of SMCRA.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment
submitted on October 1, 1993. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify
at a public hearing, no hearing was held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director reopened the public comment for the revised amendment submitted on April 5, 1994. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments from the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the heads of other Federal agencies
with an actual or potential interest in the Alabama program. No comments were received.

Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the program amendment submitted by Alabama on October 1, 1993,
and revised on April 5, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 901 codifying decisions concerning the Alabama program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs in conformity with the Federal standards without delay. Consistency
of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State and Tribal
abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and adopted by a specific
State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions
thereof submitted by a State or Tribe are based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements
of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.

National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned
mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior [516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant
economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing the approval of a proposed amendment to the Maryland regulatory program (hereinafter referred
to as the ``Maryland program'' under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Maryland proposed
a repeal of section 08.13.02 (Deep Mining of Coal) of the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR). Regulations in the
repealed section necessary to regulate the deep mining of coal were transferred to or already exist under new COMAR
08.20 (Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation under Federally Approved Program). These regulations include: COMAR
08.20.02.18 (Deep Mine Applications), COMAR 08.20.13 (Surface Effects of Deep Mines), and COMAR 08.20.14.13 (Deep
Mine Bonding Requirements). Maryland is also modifying or adding new sections to subtitle 20 of Title 8 of the Maryland
regulations. These sections are 08.20.02.18, 08.20.13.01, 08.20.13.03, 08.20.13.04, 08.20.13.10, and 08.20.13.11.
This amendment is intended to revise the Maryland program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.

II. Submission of Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated February 25, 1994 (Administrative Record No. MD&hyph;566.00), Maryland submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA at its own initiative. Maryland proposed to repeal COMAR 08.13.02 (Deep Mining of
Coal) and transfer the deep mining regulations to new COMAR 08.20 (Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Under Federally
Approved Program). The regulations include: COMAR 08.20.02.18 (Deep Mine Applications), 08.20.13 (Surface Effects
of Deep Mines), and 08.20.14.13 (Deep Mine Bonding Requirements). Maryland is also modifying or adding new sections
to subtitle 20 of Title 8 of the Maryland regulations. These sections are 08.20.02.18, 08.20.13.01, 08.20,13.03,
08.20.13.04, 08.20.13.10, and 08.20.13.11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Revisions to Maryland's Regulations That Are Not Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the
Federal Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. COMAR 08.13.02_Deep Mining of Coal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maryland is proposing to repeal COMAR 08.13.02 and to incorporate or are duplicative of the requirements of those
regulations which are required to regulate the deep mining of coal into COMAR 08.20.02 and COMAR 08.20.13. The specific
revisions to COMAR 08.20 are discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those sections of COMAR 08.13.02 being repealed and incorporated into COMAR 08.20.02 and 08.20.13 are: .01 (Definitions),
.02 (Application Requirements), .03 (Contents_Maps), .04 (Mining and Reclamation Plan), .05 (Projection Maps),
.07 (Deep-Mining Bonds), .11 (Mine Opening Sealing), .12 (Barriers), .13 (Subsidence Control), .14 (Mine Operation),
and .15 (Variances). The deletions of sections .06 (Application Review Procedures), .08 (Interim Permits), .09
(Flagging or Marking Affected Areas), and .10 (Standards) were previously approved by OSM on June 17, 1993 (58 FR 33331).
In the same notice, OSM also approved deletions of subsections .01B, E, M; .02C(2); and .03E, J, M.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the provisions of COMAR 08.13.02 being repealed are included in COMAR 08.20 except for 08.13.15 which has
no comparable Federal requirement, the Director finds that the proposed repeal of COMAR 08.13.02 does not render
the State program less effective than the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. COMAR 08.20.02.18_Deep Mine Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maryland is proposing to add COMAR 08.20.02.18 to specify certain requirements for deep mine permit applications.
In addition to the general requirements for permit applications specified in COMAR 08.20.02, deep mine permit applications
must include: (a) an application fee, (b) an application for other required permits, (c) certain mineral owner information,
(d) a map of the proposed underground portion of the affected area which provides certain information, (e) cross-sections
above the underground workings, (f) a geologic structure map which provides certain information, (g) results of
laboratory analyses, if required, (h) information on existing adjacent deep mines, (i) certain hydrologic information,
and (j) any other information requested by Maryland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 783.24 and 783.25 specify the minimum requirements for maps, cross sections, and
plans in underground mining permit applications. Since these application requirements are in addition to, and do
not supersede, those required under COMAR 08.20.02, the Director finds them consistent with the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 783.24 and 783.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. COMAR 08.20.13_Surface Effects of Deep Mines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) At COMAR 08.20.13.01, Maryland is proposing to change a reference from COMAR 08.13.02 to the Natural Resources
Article, Title 7, Subtitle 5A. This is necessitated by the proposed repeal of COMAR 08.13.02.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the proposed revision at COMAR 08.20.13.01 is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA
and the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At COMAR 08.20.13.03 (C) and (D), Maryland is proposing to require that all mine opening seals be designed using
the best technology currently available and that the design and construction be certified by a registered professional
engineer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.15 require that underground
openings be properly managed in accordance with regulatory authority regulations. The Director finds that the proposed
regulations at COMAR 08.20.13.03 are consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.15.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) At COMAR 08.20.13.04(D), Maryland is proposing to require that surface openings and accesses to underground
workings be located to prevent gravity discharge of water, unless certain demonstrations relating to effluent limitations
are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation at COMAR 08.20.13.04(D) is substantively identical to the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 817.41(i)
except that the Federal rule prohibits any discharge from a drift mine. The Director notes that Maryland does not have
drift mines. The Director finds it is no less effective than the Federal regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) At COMAR 08.20.13.10(D), Maryland is proposing to prohibit underground mining activities within the subjacent
area where mining is predicted to result in the subsidence of any public bridge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(d) prohibit underground mining activities beneath or adjacent to public
facilities if subsidence may cause material damage to those facilities. The Director finds that the proposed regulations
at COMAR 08.20.13.10 is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) At COMAR 08.20.13.11, Maryland is proposing to require that barriers of solid coal be provided around the perimeter
of the underground mine area, except for approved entries. The barriers must be able to support the overburden and
withstand anticipated hydrostatic pressure. The barriers must meet certain design and performance standards which
are enumerated in the Maryland regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(a) require the operator
to adopt measures consistent with known technology which prevent subsidence, maximize mine stability, and maintain
the value of surface lands. The Director finds that the proposed regulation at COMAR 08.20.13.11 is consistent with
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) At COMAR 08.20.13.12, Maryland is proposing to establish submission and content requirements for projection
maps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no direct Federal counterpart for this regulation. However, the Director finds that the regulation is not
inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

4. COMAR 08.20.14.13_Deep Mine Bonding Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At COMAR 08.20.14.13(A), Maryland is proposing to delete a reference pertaining to the submission of a general and
a revegetation bond. In the same section, a reference to COMAR 08.13.02.07 (which is being repealed) is also being
deleted. At subsection (C), Maryland is proposing to delete a provision that limits the period of liability for those
portions of a deep mine that continuously disturb the surface for a period exceeding five years to the term of the deep
mine permit, which is a five year maximum period. Also proposed for deletion at subsection (E), are provisions pertaining
to bond liability for mine drainage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.17 pertaining to bonding requirements for underground coal mines contain no
comparable provisions. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed deletions at COMAR 08.20.14.13(A), (C),
and (E) do not render the Maryland State program less effective than the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the Administrator
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the heads
of other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Maryland program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, commented on provisions of COMAR 08.13.02.10 and
08.13.02.12 and the applicable Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) requirements. The Director notes that
the provisions of COMAR 08.13.02 are being repealed as discussed in Finding 1. Those provisions incorporated into
COMAR 08.20.02 and 08.20.13 are found to be no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director acknowledges
MSHA's comments but according to 516(a) and 702 of SMCRA, the cited Maryland regulation cannot be construed as superseding,
amending or repealing any MSHA regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, recommended that in COMAR 08.13.02.13A and 08.20.13.10D, water impoundments
be included with public bridges as areas on which mining should be prohibited if subsidence is likely to occur. The
Director notes that the provisions of COMAR 08.13.02 are being repealed as discussed in Finding 1. Further, in COMAR
08.20.13.10A, Maryland generally prohibits underground mining beneath impoundments having a storage volume of
20 acre-feet or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines, concurred without comment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by Maryland on February 25,
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 920 codifying decisions concerning the Maryland program are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

II. Submission of Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 1, 1986, Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment to the Wyoming program under the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201&hyph;1328, concerning contemporaneous reclamation. In the amendment,
Wyoming proposed changes to its time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading (Administrative
Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;3). By letter dated November 30, 1993, Wyoming submitted additional information regarding
the proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;1). In its letter, Wyoming requested that OSM
reopen its review of the May 1, 1986, proposed amendment regarding time and distance performance standards for rough
backfilling and grading, on which the Director had deferred action in the November 24, 1986,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

was intended to clarify Wyoming's May 1, 1986, proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the amendment submitted by Wyoming on May 1, 1986, as subsequently clarified on November 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 1, 1986, the State of Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment revising nine Chapters of its approved permanent
program regulations, known as the Rules and Regulations of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land
Quality Division (DEQ/LQD). The amendment was in response to a December 23, 1985, letter that OSM sent in accordance
with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(d). Included in the submittal were proposed changes to Wyoming's regulation
at Chapter IV, Section 2(b)(i), regarding Wyoming's time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling
and grading.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 18621), OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment package and invited public comment on its adequacy.
Because no one requested a public hearing, none was held. The comment period closed on June 20, 1986.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 42209), OSM announced the decision to defer action on the proposed revision to the time and distance performance
standards for rough backfilling and grading. At the time of Wyoming's submission (May 1, 1986), the remand of the counterpart
Federal regulation, 30 CFR 816.101, was under appeal by the Secretary to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit. The District Court for the District of Columbia had remanded the Federal regulations at 30 CFR
816.100 and 816.101, holding that OSM's decision to remove 30 CFR 816.101, containing the time and distance performance
standards for rough backfilling and grading, left State regulatory authorities with inadequate guidance concerning
how to enforce the contemporaneous reclamation requirement of section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA.

, 839 F.2d 694 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Pursuant to the Court of Appeals' decision, on December 17, 1991, OSM promulgated new
regulations, at 30 CFR 816.101, that provided national time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling
and grading for surface mining operations. Those regulations were subsequently challenged in

the District of Columbia as the result of a joint stipulation of the parties that included OSM's agreement to suspend
the regulation at 30 CFR 816.101.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 30, 1993, Wyoming submitted a request to OSM to reopen the review of the deferred amendment.
The request included Wyoming's rationale for not including time and distance standards in its program. The request
also included information concerning how compliance with the proposed contemporaneous reclamation requirement
would be determined (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Wyoming amendment would remove specific time and distance standards for backfilling and grading in
favor of a general requirement that backfilling and grading follow coal removal ``as contemporaneously as possible
based upon the mining conditions.'' Additionally, Wyoming's proposed rule requires that each permit application
include a backfilling and grading schedule with a ``supporting analysis.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December 17, 1991, Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.101 concerning time and distance performance standards
for rough backfilling and grading were suspended by OSM on July 31, 1992. Therefore, in absence of a specific Federal
regulation providing specific time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading, the Federal
standards against which State time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading must be
judged are section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 816.100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA requires that surface coal mining and reclamation operations be conducted so as to insure
that all reclamation efforts proceed as contemporaneously as practicable with the surface coal mining operations.
The Federal regulation at 816.100 similarly provides that backfilling and grading shall occur ``as contemporaneously
as practicable with mining operations *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming's proposed rule requires that ``Rough backfilling and grading shall follow coal removal as contemporaneously
as possible based upon the mining conditions *&blank;*&blank;*.'' OSM interprets Wyoming's phrase ``as contemporaneously
as possible based upon the mining conditions,'' to be equivalent to the Federal phrase, ``as contemporaneously as
practicable with mining operations,'' in section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 816.100. OSM notes that the American
Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982), on page 967, includes the word ``practicable'' in its list of
words synonymous with the word ``possible.''

OSM notes that Wyoming, in its letter of November 30, 1993, explained why the existing specific, program-wide time
and distance standards for rough backfilling and grading have proven infeasible because of unique local mining conditions
in Wyoming. Specifically, Wyoming asserted that the time standard of its regulations was not workable because mines
with low tonnage proceed slowly and cannot reclaim quickly enough to meet the time limit (60 or 180 days, depending
on the type of mining). Wyoming further explained that the pace of mining in Wyoming varies with the topography of the
land being mined. When an operation passes through a ridge, explained Wyoming, a large amount of overburden is removed,
enabling reclamation to be completed in a timely manner. Conversely, when the operation passes through a drainage,
a small amount of overburden is removed, limiting how quickly the operator can reclaim.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for the current distance standard (1500 linear feet or four spoil ridges, depending on the type of mining) in its
regulations, Wyoming argued that it is arbitrary, unfairly affecting operations using large mining equipment.
Wyoming asserted that operations using large equipment need a more relaxed standard in order to operate safely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Wyoming argued that its proposed regulation, although containing no statewide standards, is workable
and inspectable because each operator must include time and/or distance standards in his or her permit application
in accordance with the approved State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM recognizes that, in addition to permit-specific time and distance standards, the requirement in the Wyoming
program to provide an analysis that supports the dollar amount of an operators performance bond will encourage operators
to reclaim in a timely fashion. Operators must include, in the permit application, a detailed operation plan, a reclamation
plan, and a resource protection plan, including a plan for minimizing erosion and the extent of the disturbed area.
The supporting analysis for the dollar amount of the performance bond is based upon these other plans. If these plans
allow for an unusually large area of unreclaimed land to exist for an unusually long period of time, the dollar amount
of the performance bond will be correspondingly large, to account for the increased chance of environmental degradation.
Therefore, to keep the dollar amount of the performance bond from being so large that it is financially impractical,
an operator will be constrained to reclaiming in a timely fashion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the proposed rule change to LQD Rules Chapter IV, Section 2(b)(i)
is no less stringent than section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA and no less effective than 30 CFR 816.100 and is approving the
proposed rule.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Written comments were received from the Wyoming Outdoor Council (WOC) (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;24).
The WOC expressed concern that the proposed rule changes are inconsistent with and less effective than the Federal
laws and regulations as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The WOC questioned why the permanent State rules included the revised language upon which the Director deferred
approval in 1986. In response, OSM notes that those rules, while incorporated into the State program by Wyoming, were
never approved by OSM as part of the approved State program. As discussed previously in this notice, OSM deferred action
on the proposed change in November of 1986. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) specifically provide that
no changes proposed by the State to laws or regulations that make up an approved State program shall take effect for
purposes of a State program until approved as a program amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The WOC asserted that the variables and factors described in Wyoming's November 30, 1993, letter of explanation
should be specifically incorporated into the rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM does not agree with WOC. The State's rationale supporting its decision to repeal specific program-wide time and
distance standards for backfilling and grading and its explanation of why local conditions and mining situations
support non-specific program-wide standards, while helpful, is not critical to OSM's decision to approve these
proposed changes. Wyoming's proposed changes to its contemporaneous reclamation regulations, without the inclusion
of the explanation contained in the November 30, 1993, letter, are no less effective than the corresponding provisions
of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Therefore, OSM cannot require Wyoming to include the explanation of the November
30, 1993, letter in the actual language of the amended State regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. A summary of the comments,
and the Directors responses to them, appear below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI)_Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USDI_Bureau
of Mines, USDI_Geological Survey, and the U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health Administration each responded
that it had no comment (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;25&hyph;22, WY&hyph;25&hyph;14, WY&hyph;25&hyph;16,
WY&hyph;25&hyph;15, and WY&hyph;25&hyph;17 respectively).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) recommended that,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The State program be as specific as possible pertaining to time and space requirements for contemporaneous reclamation
and not completely rely on the development of case by case individual permits requirements. We believe, if there is
not adequate standards established, the State Program will have difficulty in maintaining consistency and compliance
with the intent of the Reclamation Act.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, the State's contemporaneous reclamation regulations are as stringent and as effective
as the corresponding provisions in SMCRA and the Federal regulations. OSM is not authorized by SMCRA to require State
programs to be more stringent than SMCRA or more effective than the Federal regulations. OSM cannot, therefore, require
Wyoming to further amend its program in response to the FWS's comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, commented that the proposed changes seem to be
logical and valid (administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;12).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and the ACHP for comment. No comments
were received from the ACHP. The Wyoming Division of Parks and Cultural Resources_State Historic Preservation Office
commented by reminding OSM that management of cultural resources on OSM projects is conducted in accordance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Advisory Council regulations at 36 CFR part 800. The SHPO
had no objections to the proposed Wyoming amendment provided that OSM follows the procedures contained in 36 CFR part
800 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;19). OSM assures the SHPO that it is obligated to follow the procedures
at 36 CFR part 800.

Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to provisions of a State program amendment which relate
to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 7, 1994, the EPA replied that it had no comment on Wyoming's proposed amendment (Administrative Record
No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;13).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted May 1, 1986,
and as subsequently clarified on November 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undo delay.
Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Compliance With Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District until May 19, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.

Discussion of Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cleveland Charity Classic will be held on Cleveland Harbor on July 23, 1994. This event will have an estimated 20&hyph;30
offshore race boats, racing a closed course race on Lake Erie, Cleveland Harbor, which could pose hazards to navigation
in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property on navigable waters
during this event. The effect of this regulation will be to restrict general navigation on that portion of Lake Erie,
Cleveland Harbor, in an area triangular in shape, from the Cleveland Waterworks Intake Crib Light (LLNR 4030), thence
to the West Pier Light (LLNR 4185), thence to the Disposal Light B (LLNR 4045), back to the point of origin, for the safety
of spectators and participants. Any vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval
of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Cleveland Harbor, OH).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget Under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

On January 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published a proposed rule (59 FR 986) concerning this amendment. The Commander,
Second Coast Guard District, also published the proposal as a Public Notice dated January 14, 1994. Interested parties
were given until February 22, 1994, to submit comments. The Coast Guard received seven comments on the proposal. A
public meeting was requested and hosted by the Chairman of the Tazewell County Board in Pekin, Illinois, on March 14,
1994.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chicago and Northwestern (C&amp;NW) bridge at Pekin Illinois Bridge is presently maintained in the open position
and is closed by an on-site bridge tender upon the approach of a train. C&amp;NW will install remote operating equipment
and a control system, including radar, infrared boat detector, high intensity lights and communications equipment
that will permit operation of the draw from the Chicago and Northwestern office in Chicago, Illinois. Equipment will
indicate any malfunction in the bridge operation and enable the remote operator to ascertain the position of the lift
span at any time. The marine radio system will receive and transmit on the VHF marine frequencies authorized by the
Federal Communications Commission. Additionally, portable radiotelephone equipment will be provided to permit
direct communications with vessels when the bridge is operated at the bridge site. A radar antenna will be installed
on the fixed portion of the bridge structure, and the received signal will be transmitted by fixed lines and a microwave
link to the Chicago and Northwestern office in Chicago. The radar system is designed to scan upstream and downstream
of the bridge. Infrared scanners will be located on the upstream and downstream ends of the channel span piers to detect
vessels in the channel span. If an obstruction is detected beneath the lift span during the closing cycle before the
span is seated and locked, the lift span will be automatically stopped and immediately raised to the fully open position
until the channel is clear. During the bridge closing cycle, an automatic, synthesized voice announcement will be
broadcast. At the appropriate times in the closing cycle, the broadcast will announce that the bridge will close to
navigation, that the bridge is closed to navigation, or that the bridge has reopened to navigation.

Discussion of Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven comments were received in response to the Public Notice. One comment addressed the dangerous location of the
bridge, the distraction of high intensity lights, the inability to discern by radar between various types of vessels,
the additional duties assigned to the remotely located operator, and the safe passage of vessels if the bridge operator
cannot maintain visual and radio contact. The bridge owner questioned the comment's reference to the dangerous location
of the bridge and reasoned that the proposed procedure will be more favorable to river traffic than the current operation.
The bridge owner reported that current bridge operators are assigned non-bridge related clerical duties in addition
to operating the bridge for the six to eight daily trains. The radar to be installed on the bridge is similar to the radar
equipment used on vessels, and operators will be trained in its use. In response to the question about back-up power,
the bridge is equipped with a standby generator that would power all systems, including the bridge itself, in case
of a failure of commercial power. If the infrared detectors fail, it will be physically impossible to remotely lower
the bridge. Standard Department of Transportation traffic warning lights will be used in lieu of high intensity lights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois River Carriers Association commented that it does not object to the proposal as described, but questioned
if the bridge could accidentally be lowered on or in front of a tow. They also recommended that a trial period, monitored
by the Coast Guard, be established for a specified time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bridge owner has no objection to the trial period and advises they expect the Coast Guard will evaluate the operation.
C&amp;NW has reported the remote operator cannot ``accidentally'' initiate the lowering sequence. A series of commands
from a dispatcher control console must be entered; all the remote operator can do is initiate the sequence for lowering
the bridge. The system would have to run through the 10 minute advance warning cycle before the drawspan would begin
to lower. If the infrared beam is broken, the lowering is automatically aborted, and the span returns to the fully open
position. The entire lowering sequence, including the warning cycle, must be repeated before span will again lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Divisions of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in South Pekin, Illinois, and Chicago, Illinois, commented
that an on-site bridge operator is needed to report collisions from barges to maintenance personnel, and that withdrawal
of bridge operators would result in reduced maintenance and possible operation problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has established a program requiring vessel operators to report any contact with bridge structures.
These incidents are reported to the bridge owner for investigation to determine the structural safety of the bridge.
C&amp;NW has responded that equipment would enable the remote operator to detect any malfunction in the operation
of the lift span, resulting in maintenance personnel being dispatched to the bridge site. If equipment at the bridge
site were vandalized, the bridge would not lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submittals from the United Transportation Union, the Transportation Communications International Union and divisions
of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in South Pekin, Illinois and Chicago, Illinois, commented on railroad
operations and personnel issues, which are not within the scope of this regulation or the Coast Guard's jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chairman of the Tazewell County Board expressed the Board's concerns for the safety of the operation if bridge
is operated from a remote location, and the loss of four jobs and the impact on the involved families. A public meeting
hosted by the Tazewell County Board was held on March 14, 1994; representatives of Chicago and Northwestern Railroad
answered questions and addressed concerns about the navigational and structural safety of the bridge, and railroad
operations and personnel issues.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original proposal provided for installation of equipment that would permit operation of the span by authorized
railroad personnel at either portal of the bridge. C&amp;NW has decided to omit the ``portal'' controls, since, should
it be necessary to lower the span at the bridge site, the span could be operated from the bridge house on top of the span,
or from the signal bungalow south of the bridge. If the span is operated from either bridge site location, the span would
not be lowered until the 10-minute warning period, including voice announcements, had been completed, and the local
operator had confirmed, either visually or by radiotelephone, that no boats were under or approaching the bridge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the owner's response to comments on the remote operation of this bridge, the Coast Guard is publishing the
requirements as proposed.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because a sample group of Illinois
River users have expressed no objection to the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the submitted comments, the Coast Guard finds that any impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial.
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this temporary rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et

Federalism Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has reviewed the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of the NEPA
Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental
documentation because promulgation of changes to drawbridge regulations have been found to not have a significant
effect on the human environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The draw of the Chicago and Northwestern railroad bridge, Mile 151.2, at Pekin, Illinois, is operated by a remote
operator located at the Chicago and Northwestern offices in Chicago, Illinois, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The draw is normally maintained in the fully open position, displaying green mid-channel lights to indicate that
the span is fully open.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The draw is equipped with the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A radiotelephone link direct to the remote operator;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A horn for sound signals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Eight high intensity amber warning lights, oriented upstream and downstream, with two secured to the uppermost
chord and two secured to the lowermost chord of the drawspan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A radar antenna on the lower portion of the drawspan capable of scanning one mile upstream and one mile downstream;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Infrared scanners located on the upstream and downstream ends of the channel span piers, to detect vessels or other
obstructions under the bridge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The remote operator shall maintain a radiotelephone watch for mariners to establish contact as they approach
the bridge to ensure that the draw is open or that it remains open until passage is complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When a train approaches the bridge and the draw is in the open position, the remote operator initiates a ten minute
warning period before closing the bridge. During this warning period, the amber lights begin flashing and a signal
of four short blasts sounds on a horn. The four-blast signal will repeat after a five second interval. A synthesized-voice
message is broadcast over the radiotelephone as follows: ``The Chicago and Northwestern railroad bridge at Mile
151.2, Illinois River, will close to navigation in ten minutes.'' The announcement is repeated every two minutes,
counting down the time remaining until closure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) At the end of the ten minute warning period, the remote bridge operator scans under the bridge using infrared detectors
and the upstream and downstream approaches to the bridge using radar to determine whether any vessels are under or
are approaching the bridge. If any vessels are under or are approaching the bridge within one mile as determined by
infrared or radar scanning or by a radiotelephone response, the remote operator shall not close the bridge until the
vessel or vessels have cleared the bridge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If no vessels are under or approaching the bridge, the mid-channel navigation lights will change from green to
red, the horn signal of four short blasts will sound, twice, and the radiotelephone message will change to: ``The Chicago
and Northwestern Railroad Bridge at Mile 151.2, Illinois River, is closed to navigation.'' The message will repeat
every two minutes and the amber lights will continue to flash until the bridge is fully reopened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the infrared scanners detect a vessel or other obstruction under the bridge before the drawspan is fully lowered
and locked, the closing sequence is stopped, automatically, and the drawspan is raised to its fully open position
until the channel is clear. When obstruction has cleared the navigation span, the remote operator confirms that the
channel is clear, and reinitiates the ten-minute warning cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) After the train has cleared the bridge, the remote operator initiates the lift span raising cycle. When the draw
is raised to its full height and locked in place, the flashing lights stop and the mid-channel navigation lights change
from red to green. The synthesized voice announcement broadcasts at two minute intervals for ten minutes that the
bridge is reopened to navigation.

action is necessary to ensure the safety of structures and vessels operating in the regulated area. Due to the complex
planning and coordination involved, notice of the final details for the show were not available to the Coast Guard
from the St. Helens Fireworks Committee until 30 days prior to the show. Therefore, sufficient time was not available
to publish the proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide a delayed effective date. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would be impracticable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The event requiring this regulation will begin on July 4, 1994 at 8:45 p.m. (PDT). Upon request of the St. Helens Fireworks
Committee, the Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone from Columbia River mile 85.8 to river mile 86.5. This fireworks
display may result in a large number of vessels congregating near the fireworks launch site. Concern is justified
due to the possibility of debris and unexploded fireworks falling into the Columbia River in the vicinity of the launch
site. This safety zone will be enforced by representatives of the Captain of the Port Portland, Oregon. The Captain
of the Port may be assisted by other federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold the event was just recently received leaving insufficient
time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lake Union Fireworks Display is being held as part of the celebration for the Fourth of July Independence Day in
Seattle, Washington. This event is sponsored by Cellular One and the City of Seattle. The fireworks display is conducted
from a barge located on the waters of Lake Union, Seattle, Washington. This one day event attracts a large number of
spectators gathered on the waters near the fireworks display. To promote the safety of both the spectators and participants,
this safety zone is required to keep spectators away from the explosive fireworks barge during the fireworks display.
The exclusionary area is designed to keep all spectators away from the fireworks barge.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from
review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

Rehabilitation Services Administration programs and amends 34 CFR Parts 373, 379, 381, and 385 to display and codify
the control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to information collection requirements
contained in the regulations. The Department must display and codify the control numbers to comply with applicable
statutory and regulatory requirements. Publication of these control numbers informs the public that OMB has approved
the information collection requirements and that they have taken effect.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Final regulations for a variety of Rehabilitation Services Administration programs were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8330). At the time of publication of the regulations, it was noted that certain sections
of the regulations contained information collection requirements requiring review by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), and those sections would become effective after approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, as amended.

OMB has approved the information collection requirements in &sect;&sect;373.30, 379.43, 381.10, and 385.45 of
those regulations, and those sections of the regulations are now effective.

In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does
not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that proposed
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under
5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The interim final regulations which are subject to this change in effective date implement certain provisions of
the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 relating to the determination of institutional cohort default
rates in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The effective date of these regulations has been delayed
until July 1, 1994 so that all of the regulations implementing changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended,
(HEA), published by the Secretary on April 29, 1994 will take effect on July 1, 1994. The Secretary was informed that
there was confusion about the effective date of the regulations because the other regulations published on April
29, 1994 and implementing changes to the HEA were not effective until July 1, 1994. The Secretary is delaying the effective
date of these regulations to resolve the confusion and to afford participants in the FFEL program additional time
to comply with the requirements of these regulations.

In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)), and
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the
opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, because the Secretary is delaying the effective date of
these regulations for only a brief period to reduce confusion and afford participants in the FFEL program additional
time for compliance, the Secretary finds, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that the solicitation of public
comment on this change in the effective date would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

 The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;211), enacted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 12, 1994, authorized the Secretary to reallocate, for use in award year 1994&hyph;1995 only, any excess
funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and the FWS programs from the 1993&hyph;94 award year to assist individuals who
suffered financial harm as a result of the January 1994 earthquake in Southern California and other disasters. The
Act intended that these funds would be reallocated to institutions for use in award year 1994&hyph;95 to assist students
who have been adversely affected by the California earthquake of January 1994 and the Midwest floods of 1993.

 EPA is approving revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP). On November 20, 1992, the State
of North Carolina through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Management (NCDEM) submitted revisions
to its SIP. These revisions will add regulations to implement an oxygenated gasoline program in the Raleigh/Durham
and the Winston-Salem/Greensboro/High Point metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). This plan was submitted to
satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. The intended effect of this action is to approve the
oxygenated gasoline program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Motor vehicles are significant sources of CO emissions. An important measure toward reducing these emissions is
the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps to offset fuel-rich
operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starting, which are more prevalent in the winter. Section 211(m)
of the Act requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline programs
by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment areas
with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 air quality data. Each state's oxygenated
gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen
by weight during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of CO. The oxygenated
gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the nonattainment area is located. The
length of the control period, established by section 211(m) of the Act, is from November 1 through February 29. Also,
guidelines on the establishment of control periods were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 20, 1992. The State of North Carolina implemented the program during November 1992 through February 1993
and November 1993 through February 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The counties of Durham and Wake (Raleigh/Durham) and Forsyth (Winston-Salem) in the State of North Carolina are designated
nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value of 10.9 and 9.7 parts per million, respectively,
based on 1988 and 1989 air quality data. Under section 211(m) of the Act, North Carolina was required to submit a revised
SIP under section 110 and part D of title I of the Act which includes an oxygenated gasoline program for Raleigh/Durham
MSA and the Winston-Salem/Greensboro/High Point MSA by November 15, 1992. On November 20, 1992, the NCDEM submitted
to EPA a revised SIP including the oxygenated gasoline program that was adopted by the state on July 9, 1992 and June
26, 1992. EPA summarizes its analysis of the state submittal below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Carolina oxygenated gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline, containing a minimum of 2.7 percent
oxygen content by weight, be sold in the MSA in which each nonattainment area is located, consistent with the requirements
of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. North Carolina has included requirements in their rules related to documentation
that must accompany the fuel while it is being transferred through the distribution chain. These transfer document
requirements will enhance the enforcement of the oxygenated gasoline regulation, by providing a paper trail for
each gasoline sample taken by state enforcement personnel.

State oxygenated gasoline regulations will be enforced by the Standards Division of the North Carolina Department
of Agriculture. The Standard Division has agreed to inspect, a minimum of one time per season, 40 percent of all retail
gasoline stations located in the program area. The inspections will consist of fuel sampling and record review. The
Standards Division has the authority to stop the sale of the product and give fines. The fine will be calculated by multiplying
the amount of fuel found in violation by the price difference between oxygenated and clear gasoline and then doubled.
EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in appendix D of 40 CFR part 80. North Carolina has elected to use the ASTM&hyph;D48150989
test method, which has been approved by EPA. North Carolina is using the same testing tolerances established by EPA.
Additionally, North Carolina has adopted labeling regulations consistent with the Federal regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the regulation because it meets all applicable requirements for oxygenated fuel programs. This
action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant
comments on them. This action will become effective on August 29, 1994, unless adverse comments are received by August
1, 1994. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received
will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see short informational notice published,
simultaneously, in the proposal section of this

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 29, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each
request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Order is one in a series of orders issued in response to a petition filed with EPA in 1989 seeking the revocation
of 14 tolerances as violative of the Delaney anti-cancer clause in section 409(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 348(c). In its first Order on the petition issued in 1990, 55 FR 17560 (April 25, 1990), EPA refused
to revoke several of the tolerances on the ground that even though the pesticides involved were animal carcinogens,
the Delaney clause contains an exception for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 risks. Following EPA's affirmance of that Order after an administrative appeal (56 FR 7750, Feb. 25, 1991), EPA's
decision was set aside by a court in 1992 based on the court's finding that the Delaney clause was not subject to an exception
for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 cancer risks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). Then in 1993, EPA issued a revised Order consistent with the court's holding, stating that
the pesticides are animal carcinogens but this time revoking the tolerances as inconsistent with the Delaney clause
(58 FR 37862, July 14, 1993). Manufacturers of the subject pesticides and a trade association filed objections to
the revised Order, as well as requests for hearings on, and stays of, the revocation Order. This final Order addresses
those objections and requests for hearings and stays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, most of the objections submitted address the issue of whether the subject pesticides ``induce cancer''
within the meaning of the Delaney clause. However, EPA concludes herein that this issue was resolved in an earlier
Order and the objectors are precluded from raising issues already finally decided. EPA finds that the objectors do
not make an adequate case for reopening that issue. Therefore, objections and requests for hearings focused on whether
the subject pesticides induce cancer are denied by this Order. Other objections and a request for a hearing on an issue
other than whether the pesticides induce cancer are also denied. In sum, this Order denies the objections and hearing
and stay requests pertaining to revocation of the following section 409 tolerances: (1) Benomyl_raisins and processed
tomato products (40 CFR 185.350); (2) trifluralin_peppermint and spearmint oil (40 CFR 185.5900); (3) mancozeb_bran
of wheat (40 CFR 185.6300); and (4) phosmet_ cottonseed oil (40 CFR 185.3950). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The July 14, 1993 final rule (58 FR 37862) is withdrawn as to the section 409 tolerance for mancozeb on raisins because
EPA has published another final rule elsewhere in this issue of the

I. Statutory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq., authorizes the establishment by regulation
of maximum permissible levels of pesticides in foods. Such regulations are commonly referred to as ``tolerances.''
Without such a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance, a food containing a pesticide residue
is ``adulterated'' under section 402 of the FFDCA and may not be legally moved in interstate commerce. 21 U.S.C. 331,
342. EPA was authorized to establish pesticide tolerances under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970. 5 U.S.C. App. at
1343 (1988). Monitoring and enforcement of pesticide tolerances are carried out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FFDCA has separate provisions for tolerances for pesticide residues on raw agricultural commodities (RACs)
and tolerances on processed food. For pesticide residues in or on RACs, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions
from tolerances when appropriate, under section 408. 21 U.S.C. 346a. EPA regulates pesticide residues in processed
foods under section 409, which pertains to ``food additives.'' 21 U.S.C. 348. Maximum residue regulations established
under section 409 are commonly referred to as food additive tolerances or food additive regulations. Section 409
food additive regulations are needed, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section
402(a)(2) of the FFDCA, a pesticide residue in processed food generally will not render the food adulterated if the
residue results from application of the pesticide to a RAC and the residue in the processed food when ready to eat is
below the RAC tolerance. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through'' provision
because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to the processed food form. Thus, a section 409
food additive regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when the concentration
of the pesticide residue in a processed food when ready-to-eat is greater than the tolerance prescribed for the RAC,
or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact with a pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to establishing a food additive regulation under section 409, EPA must determine that the ``proposed use of
the food additive [pesticide], under the conditions of use to be specified in the regulation, will be safe.'' 21 U.S.C.
348(c)(3). Section 409 specifically addresses the safety of carcinogenic substances in the so-called Delaney clause,
which provides that ``no additive shall be deemed safe if it has been found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal
or if it is found, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food additives, to induce cancer
in man or animal * * * .''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 409 food additive regulations may be established or revoked by EPA by order in response to petitions from any
person. 21 U.S.C. 348(b). Adversely affected parties may object to an order issued in response to a petition and such
parties may seek an administrative hearing on the order. 21 U.S.C. 348(f). Only an order responding to objections
is subject to judicial review. 21 U.S.C. 348(g).

II. Regulatory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proceeding was initiated on May 25, 1989, by a petition filed by the State of California, the Natural Resources
Defense Council, Public Citizen, the AFL-CIO, and several individuals (the ``California petition'') requesting
that EPA revoke 14 food additive regulations for the pesticides trifluralin (in spearmint and peppermint oil), 40
CFR 185.5900; benomyl (in raisins and tomato products), 40 CFR 185.350; phosmet (in cottonseed oil), 40 CFR 185.3950;
mancozeb (in raisins and bran of barley, oats, rye, and wheat), 40 CFR 185.6300; dicofol (in dried tea), 40 CFR 185.410;
DDVP (in packaged and bagged nonperishable processed foods and dried figs), 40 CFR 185.1900; and chlordimeform (in
dried prunes), 40 CFR 185.750. Petitioners argued that these food additive regulations should be revoked because
the seven pesticides to which the regulations applied were animal carcinogens and thus the regulations violated
the Delaney anticancer clause in section 409 of the FFDCA. 54 FR 27700 (June 30, 1989).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and sought comments on the action proposed by the petitioners. EPA received numerous comments on the petitioners'
proposal, including several comments addressing the petitioners' conclusion that EPA had found that the referenced
pesticides induced cancer within the meaning of the Delaney clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued an Order responding to the petition on April 25, 1990 (``April 1990 Order''). 55 FR 17560 (April 25, 1990).
EPA agreed with the petitioners that it had found that the seven pesticides were ``animal carcinogens'' within the
meaning of the Delaney clause, 55 FR 17566, and rejected comments to the contrary by several commenters. 55 FR 17570,
17572-73. As required by section 409, the Order provided adversely affected parties the right to file objections
and requests for hearings. EPA noted that ``[i]f objections and requests for hearings are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
submitted, * * * the issues of whether the chemicals listed by the petition induce cancer * * * could be potential factual
matters for resolution at an administrative hearing.'' 55 FR 17570.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although EPA agreed with the petitioners that all of the referenced pesticides induce cancer within the meaning of
the Delaney clause, EPA refused to revoke most of the challenged food additive regulations based on the determination
either that: (1) that the residues allowed by the food additive regulation pose a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cancer risk; (2) there was insufficient information to determine whether the residues allowed by the food additive
regulation pose a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cancer risk, and EPA believed that data to be submitted in the future would show that the cancer risk is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; or (3) action under FFDCA was appropriately withheld pending completion of an ongoing FIFRA proceeding addressing
similar cancer risk issues. EPA also announced that it had already revoked the chlordimeform food additive regulation
for dried prunes on October 25, 1989, 54 FR 43424, and agreed to revoke the food additive regulation for residues of
DDVP on dried figs, 55 FR 17567. EPA revoked the food additive regulation for DDVP on dried figs on June 26, 1991, 56 FR
29182.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 22, 1990, the original submitters of the California petition filed objections to EPA's response to their petition.
The petitioners' central objection was that EPA had incorrectly interpreted section 409 by reading a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exception into the Delaney clause. Petitioners also contended that ongoing review of a pesticide under the FIFRA
did not provide grounds for refusing to rule on their petition. EPA received no other objections, and no party requested
a hearing on any matter, including whether any of the pesticides involved induce cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 25, 1991 (56 FR 7750), EPA responded to the petitioners' objections by issuing an Order (1) denying the
petition to revoke the trifluralin, benomyl, mancozeb, and phosmet food additive regulations; and (2) stating that
revocations for the DDVP and dicofol regulations would be forthcoming. (``February 1991 Order''). EPA denied the
request to revoke the trifluralin and benomyl regulations because, although it had found the pesticides to ``induce
cancer,'' it further concluded that the residues allowed by the food additive regulations pose a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cancer risk. EPA denied the request to revoke the mancozeb regulations because the cancer risk was being addressed
in a parallel proceeding under FIFRA. Finally, EPA denied the request to revoke the phosmet regulation because EPA's
cancer finding on phosmet was only ``tentative.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original petitioners sought judicial review of EPA's ruling on their objections concerning the benomyl, trifluralin,
mancozeb, and phosmet food additive regulations. On July 8, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit,
set aside EPA's Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). Determinative to the court was that EPA had found that the subject pesticides induce cancer
within the meaning of the Delaney clause. The court dismissed EPA's various arguments on why food additive regulations
for pesticides which are animal carcinogens could be maintained. Specifically, as to benomyl and trifluralin, the
court held that the Delaney clause prohibited the establishment of food additive regulations for pesticides which
induce cancer no matter how infinitesimal the human cancer risk. For mancozeb and phosmet, the court held that the
ongoing FIFRA cancellation action concerning mancozeb and the EPA reevaluation of 2carcinogenicity data on phosmet
did not overcome the induce cancer findings. 968 F.2d at 990 n.3. The Supreme Court declined to review the decision
on February 22, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the Supreme Court's action, but prior to EPA's issuance of a revised Order responding to the California
petition, DuPont Agricultural Products (``DuPont''), the producer of benomyl, the Mancozeb Task Force (comprising
DuPont, Elf Atochem North America, Inc., and Rohm and Haas Co.), and the National Agricultural Chemicals Association
(NACA), each contacted EPA requesting that EPA respond to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision procedurally by issuing a proposed order responding to the California petition. They argued that the induce
cancer issue, among others, was not ``adequately explored or raised for comment.'' (Ref. 1 ). DuPont and NACA specifically
claimed that the ``proponents of the maintenance of the section 409 regulations were never `adversely affected'
by an EPA position [in the April 1990 Order], because no change was ever made or proposed to the existing food additive
regulations.'' (Ref. 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DuPont, the Mancozeb Task Force, and DowElanco also took several actions related to the challenged food additive
regulations in this time period. DuPont petitioned EPA to revoke the food additive regulations for benomyl on processed
tomato products and raisins (58 FR 29318, May 19, 1993; 58 FR 63575, Dec. 2, 1993). DuPont contended that the food additive
regulation on tomato products was not necessary because benomyl did not concentrate during the processing of tomatoes.
DuPont sought the revocation of the raisin food additive regulation on the ground that raisins should be classified
as a ``raw agricultural commodity,'' and thus this regulation should be repromulgated under section 408. The Mancozeb
Task Force petitioned EPA for the revocation of the mancozeb food additive regulations on bran of wheat and raisins
on the grounds that those tolerance regulations were unnecessary based on lack of concentration during processing
(58 FR 29318, May 19, 1993). Finally, DowElanco requested that EPA cancel DowElanco's registration under FIFRA for
the use of trifluralin on peppermint and spearmint (57 FR 7752, March 4, 1992).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 14, 1993, EPA issued a revised Order responding to the California petition in light of the decision in

Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 37862, ``July 1993 Order''). In that Order, EPA stated that the four pesticides in question, benomyl, trifluralin,
mancozeb, and phosmet, induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney clause, and, based on the Ninth Circuit's interpretation
of the Delaney clause, EPA ordered that the challenged regulations for these pesticides be revoked. As provided in
section 409, any person adversely affected was given 30 days to file written objections to the Order and a written request
for an evidentiary hearing on the objections. Adversely affected parties were also given 30 days to file a petition
for a stay of the effective date of the Order (58 FR 37865). EPA set an effective date of August 30, 1993, for the revocations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A. Stay Petitions Filed With EPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received stay petitions from DuPont, DowElanco, the Mancozeb Task Force, and NACA covering each of the regulations
revoked by the July 1993 Order. Because EPA determined that the stay requests were properly filed, on September 16,
1993, it issued an Order (``the September Stay Order'') staying the revocations announced in the July 1993 Order for
such time as would be necessary to review the stay requests. 58 FR 48456. In the September Stay Order, EPA announced
that it would accept comments on the stay requests for fifteen days from publication of the stay. EPA received within
the comment period one comment from Gowan Inc. addressing the request for stay of the revocation of the phosmet food
additive regulation submitted by NACA. NRDC submitted comments outside the comment period. In the September Stay
Order, EPA also announced that it would publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its determination on each stay request, and, if denying a particular stay request, that the revocation of the affected
regulation would become effective upon publication of EPA's determination.

B. EPA Response To Petitions To Stay
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order announces EPA's denial of each of the petitions to stay the referenced food additive regulations. EPA's
consideration of whether to grant the requested stays for the pendency of the administrative proceedings has been
rendered moot by the fact that elsewhere in this Order EPA has denied each of the objections filed to the July 1993 Order,
as well as the hearing requests. As a result of EPA's denial of the requests to stay the revocations of the food additive
regulations for benomyl, mancozeb, trifluralin, and phosmet, the July 1993 Order becomes effective June 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gowan Co. and NRDC filed comments in response to the petitions to stay the revocations announced in the July 1993 Order.
Gowan Co., the manufacturer of phosmet, submitted comments in support of a stay arguing that phosmet was wrongly classified
as an animal carcinogen. If Gowan Co. had substantive objections to EPA's Order, it should have filed a timely objection.
Gowan Co. cannot surmount the 30-day deadline for filing objections by couching its objections as a ``comment'' on
a stay request. NRDC commented that the stay should be denied citing the length of these proceedings and arguing that
the objectors submitted no new evidence justifying further delay of the effective date of these revocations.

V. Summary of Objections and Hearing Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received objections from NACA, DuPont, DowElanco, and the Mancozeb Task Force. NACA submitted objections to
the revocation of each of the food additive regulations affected by the July 1993 Order. NACA asserted that the pesticides
involved did not induce cancer and that EPA's July 1993 Order was procedurally defective. EPA also received separate
objections on the revocations of the food additive regulations for benomyl (DuPont), mancozeb (DuPont and the Mancozeb
Task Force), and trifluralin (DowElanco). DuPont objected to the July 1993 Order arguing that (1) benomyl does not
induce cancer; (2) the benomyl and mancozeb tolerances should be revoked on other grounds; and (3) the July 1993 Order
was procedurally defective. DowElanco claimed that trifluralin does not induce cancer and that the July 1993 Order
was procedurally defective. The Mancozeb Task Force asserted that (1) the July 1993 Order was procedurally defective;
(2) EPA had failed to promulgate criteria for making an induce cancer finding; and (3) the mancozeb tolerances should
be revoked on other grounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, DuPont filed a request for a hearing on whether benomyl induces cancer and on whether the benomyl regulations
should be revoked on other grounds, and DowElanco filed a request for a hearing on whether trifluralin induces cancer.

VI. EPA Response to Hearing Requests and Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the objections submitted challenge EPA's finding that the subject pesticides ``induce cancer'' within the
meaning of the Delaney clause. However, EPA believes that the issue of whether the named pesticides induce cancer
is closed, and the objectors have not raised new evidence justifying a reopening of that issue. Therefore, EPA is denying
the objections and requests for hearings relying upon the induce cancer issue. All other objections and the remaining
hearing request are addressed and denied on other grounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part VI.A. of this preamble below, EPA explains why the objectors are precluded from raising the induce cancer issue.
In part VI.B., EPA addresses the remaining objections and hearing request and explains its grounds for denying each.

A. The Induce Cancer Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case, issues finally resolved may not be resurrected
absent manifest injustice. These doctrines are as important in the administrative context as in the judicial. In
the interest of administrative efficiency and economy, final determinations in administrative proceedings deserve
to be treated with finality. Based on the procedural requirements of FFDCA section 409 and the specific facts involved
in this proceeding, EPA believes that the issue of whether the named pesticides induce cancer under the Delaney clause
was laid to rest once the objectors failed to file objections to EPA's April 1990 Order finding that the named pesticides
induce cancer. As a result, under these doctrines, the objectors may not now rely on that issue to support a challenge
to EPA's July 1993 Order. The following sections discuss EPA's reasoning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Finality of FFDCA Section 409(c) Orders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case share a common theme, finality of decisions
in the interest of efficiency and economy. Generally, these doctrines preclude a party from resurrecting issues
that were finally decided in the same or a prior case. Depending on the circumstances, any of the three doctrines may
be invoked to preclude a party from raising an issue in an administrative setting that had been finally decided in another
or related administrative or judicial proceeding. (Ref. 3 ). Furthermore, application of any of the three doctrines
is especially appropriate in an administrative setting when the organic statute in question is specifically designed
to ensure finality of certain issues. The FFDCA is such a statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 409 of the FFDCA, any person may file a petition for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of a
food additive regulation. 21 U.S.C. 348(b) and (h). EPA must publish a summary of the petition within 30 days of its
filing. 21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5). By order issued pursuant to section 409(c) of the FFDCA, the Administrator may either
grant or deny, in whole or in part, that petition. A section 409(c) order is effective upon publication unless EPA,
in its discretion, determines that a stay of the order is appropriate. 21 U.S.C. 348(e). In addition, any person adversely
affected by a decision issued pursuant to section 409(c) of the FFDCA may file objections, specifying the reasons
for the objections, and request an administrative hearing on the objections. 21 U.S.C. 348(f). Section 409(f) requires
the Administrator to issue an order responding to the issues raised by any objections and, if a hearing is held, such
order must be based upon a fair evaluation of the entire record at the hearing. Only challenges to a section 409(f) order
are judicially reviewable. 21 U.S.C. 348(f). (Ref.4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedural framework is designed to further optimal public participation while ensuring finality of issues
that remain unopposed either at the administrative or appellate level. In sum, the FFDCA permits persons adversely
affected by a section 409(c) order to challenge that order, first at the administrative level, and then at the appellate
level. Persons adversely affected by a section 409(c) order may challenge that order through the submission of objections
and requests for a hearing. Section 409(c) orders that are not challenged by persons adversely affected by such orders
are final.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Likewise, the FFDCA permits persons adversely affected by a section 409(f) order that responds to objections and
to requests for a hearing to challenge the Agency's findings in an appellate court. Again, if such orders are not challenged
at this stage by persons adversely affected by such orders, they are final and no longer reviewable.

[i]n the FFDCA, Congress constructed an elaborate yet consistent administrative design for the proposal, consideration,
promulgation and review of regulations. The Act provides a number of well defined avenues for participation by members
of the public and review by appellate courts. These provisions permit the maximum citizen input consistent with the
Agency's need for consistency and finality.

(Ref. 5). Failure, by a person adversely affected by an Agency determination, to follow the procedures prescribed
by the FFDCA must necessarily result in determinations that are final and no longer reviewable. (Ref. 6).

Under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case, objectors may not resurrect final decisions
necessary or essential to an ultimate decision and on which objectors had the opportunity to be heard. (Ref. 7). EPA
believes that it is appropriate to apply these doctrines in proceedings it administers under the FFDCA. Parts 2, 3,
and 4 describe the final Order EPA issued making an ``induce cancer'' finding on all the subject pesticides, the adverse
effect experienced by the objectors, and why precluding the objectors from raising that issue now is appropriate
in this proceeding.

EPA's April 1990 Order Under FFDCA Section 409(c)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On April 25, 1990, EPA issued a final Order (April 1990 Order) subject to objections and requests for a hearing in response
to petitioners' request to revoke the 14 food additive regulations. In that Order, EPA concluded that the subject
pesticides induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney clause. EPA stated that it agreed with the petitioners
``that the pesticides named in the petition are animal carcinogens * * * .'' 55 FR 17566. EPA also responded to comments
submitted on the petitioners' proposal from the National Food Processors Association (NFPA), 55 FR 17570, NACA,
55 FR 17570, 17571, Rohm and Haas, 55 FR 17572, and Industria Prodotti Chimici, 55 FR 17573, arguing that the named pesticides
do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 induce cancer. In each case, EPA confirmed that the named pesticides induce cancer and provided a summary of the data
supporting each finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in the April 1990 Order, EPA summarized the NFPA comments on the California petition as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
First, NFPA claims that EPA has not determined that any of the seven pesticides listed by the petition ``induce cancer''
within the meaning of the Delaney Clause. According to NFPA, an ``induce cancer'' finding under section 409 must be
supported by sufficient evidence of animal or human carcinogenicity; in the view of the commenter, limited evidence
of animal carcinogenicity is not necessarily sufficient to support such a finding. Moreover, NFPA contends that
the characterization of pesticides as probable or possible carcinogens does not constitute a finding under the Delaney
Clause. To determine whether any of the seven pesticides ``induce cancer'' within the meaning of the Delaney Clause
would, in the view of NFPA, involve complex and disputed factual issues that cannot be appropriately resolved in the
context of the petition. (55 FR 17570)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In its response, EPA explicitly disagreed with NFPA's conclusions that the induce cancer determinations had not
been made for the pesticides and that the evidence did not support such a finding. Further, EPA specifically responded
to NFPA's comment regarding resolution ``in the context of the petition,'' by inviting objections to its findings.
EPA stated,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has taken a different position than that espoused by NFPA on the carcinogenicity of the chemicals named in the petition.
As discussed [in the chemical by chemical review of the cancer data], the available data provide at least limited evidence
that the seven pesticides induce cancer in test animals. This conclusion was reached by a weight-of-the-evidence
approach in evaluating the potential carcinogenicity of a chemical which takes into account all available data for
the chemical (see Unit II of this notice).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If objections and request for hearing are submitted, the Administrator will determine whether there are factual
issues appropriate for resolution at an evidentiary hearing. The issues of whether the chemicals listed by the petition
induce cancer and whether the risks attributable to the uses identified in the petition are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 could be potential factual matters for resolution at an administrative hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(The phrase ``limited evidence'' in the quote above is a term of art under EPA's Cancer Assessment Guidelines (51 FR
33992, Sept. 24, 1986) specifying the quantum of evidence necessary to find a substance to be a ``possible human carcinogen.'')
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's response to each of the other commenters was similar. Thus, EPA left no room for doubt in its response to the commenters
that it agreed with the petitioners' conclusion that the pesticides named by the petition induce cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support the claim that EPA did not find that the pesticides named in the California petition induce cancer within
the meaning of the Delaney clause, the objectors cite an EPA policy statement on emergency exemptions under FIFRA
and a 1993 EPA press release. The policy statement noted that ``EPA has not made formal induce cancer determinations
on many pesticides.'' (Ref. 8). This statement is in no way inconsistent with EPA having made an induce cancer finding
on a few pesticides_the pesticides in the April 1990 Order. The press release, dated February 5, 1993, listed dozens
of pesticides, including the pesticides here involved, that are potentially affected by the Delaney clause. It stated
that EPA had not made an induce cancer finding for the listed pesticides. (Ref. 9). Thus, petitioners are correct in
pointing out an inconsistency between the press release and the April 1990 Order. However, EPA would note that press
releases are informal documents which do not have the status of an FFDCA Order or a policy statement. Moreover, press
releases cannot amend an FFDCA Order.

The Adversely Affected Party Requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, the FFDCA is specifically designed to ensure finality of decisions that remain unchallenged
as to all persons that were adversely affected by those decisions. Earlier in these proceedings, EPA issued a decision
stating that the subject pesticides induce cancer. If the objectors were adversely affected by that decision, the
decision should be accorded finality and preclusive effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections address why EPA believes the objectors were adversely affected by EPA's 1990 determination
that the named pesticides induce cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Adversely Affected Standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The phrase ``adversely affected'' is a fairly common statutory phrase used to describe, in general, the standing
of persons to challenge agency decisions. That phrase is used in a number of FFDCA provisions as well as in many other
statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In the preamble to the procedural rule for FFDCA actions,
40 CFR parts 177, 178, and 179, EPA states that the adversely affected standard should be interpreted broadly and not
limited to ``narrow categories of persons.'' 55 FR 50285 (Dec. 5, 1990). This interpretation is in accordance with
the interpretation adopted by the Supreme Court in construing the same standard under the APA and by FDA in its implementation
of the FFDCA. According to the Supreme Court, the APA adversely affected standard ``is not meant to be especially demanding.''
(Ref. 10) In addition, as early as 1979, FDA adopted procedural regulations defining the adversely affected standard
used in the FFDCA. That definition states that adversely affected persons ``include any interested person.'' 21
CFR 10.3; 44 FR 22318, 22319 (April 13, 1979). FDA agreed that the result of its interpretation was to make the phrase
``adversely affected'' in its regulation ``superfluous.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. That interpretation of the adversely affected standard continues in FDA's regulations today.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Were The Objectors Adversely Affected By The April 1990 Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
? In their filings on the July 1993 Order, the objectors argue that they are injured by the stigma attached to an induce-cancer
finding. They claim that this stigma causes them not merely an adverse effect, but irreparable harm. Moreover, the
objectors do not limit this impact to the uses that are the subject of the revocation Order; rather, they extend this
impact to all uses of the affected pesticide and, in fact, to all products manufactured by their companies. By their
own admission, thus, the objectors have identified themselves as persons adversely affected by the induce-cancer
finding announced in the April 1990 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in its filings, DuPont argues that as a result of EPA's revocation of the benomyl food additive regulations,
``the use of benomyl on tomatoes and other crops could be dramatically curtailed because of the `taint' of the Delaney
Clause.'' (Ref. 11). DuPont states that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[b]eyond the significant loss in sales to DuPont, this revocation could create long-term irreparable harm to DuPont
because of the stigma attached to the unfounded allegation that benomyl ``induces cancer.'' This stigma not only
has the potential to cause ill-will against DuPont by customers and consumers, but also will adversely affect the
ability of DuPont to offer fungicide products to meet the needs of growers, thereby creating further ill-will for
the company. Customers who abandon DuPont products as a result of the adverse publicity caused by the ``induce cancer''
finding made by this Order will not likely return to using DuPont products. (Ref. 12).

DowElanco admits that the revocation action itself would have no impact. DowElanco asserts that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[s]ince DowElanco and the other U.S. registrants of trifluralin have each independently requested the voluntary
cancellation of the use of trifluralin on peppermint and spearmint, this tolerance revocation action will not directly
effect (sic) the use of trifluralin on peppermint and spearmint in this country. (Ref. 13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, DowElanco argues that it is adversely affected by the stigma attached to EPA's induce cancer finding. According
to DowElanco:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the Agency's so-called ``induce cancer'' finding for trifluralin puts this chemical in the same league with the very
small number of chemicals found by FDA to ``induce cancer'' within the meaning of the Delaney Clause, and constitutes
a direct attack by EPA on the safety of trifluralin in the eyes of growers, processors, and consumers, and on the credibility
of DowElanco in selling and distributing a product which allegedly ``induces cancer.'' * * * DowElanco will not only
directly experience lost sales of trifluralin as a result of the adverse publicity caused by the ``induce cancer''
finding made by this Order, but will also be subject to a ``taint'' which will likely adversely effect its reputation
and entire business. (Ref. 14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mancozeb Task Force makes similar admissions. The Task Force claims that EPA's induce cancer finding

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
will irreparably injure the Task Force members. Such a finding will taint the pesticide, and in all probability will
lead to substantial reduction in mancozeb's use by growers, both for those commodities involved in this proceeding
as well as for other registered uses. (Ref. 15).

[t]he Agency must recognize that determining that a pesticide ``induces cancer'' within the meaning of the Delaney
clause has significant adverse consequences for registrants, both in the regulatory context and the marketplace.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, NACA's submission is in the same vein. According to NACA:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NACA and its members have built an enviable reputation of reliably providing to its customers and the public safe and
efficacious crop protection products. They have devoted significant time, money, and effort to building the very
reputation which EPA's unfounded action will irreparably damage by suggesting that NACA's members sell products
which ``induce cancer.'' The crop protection industry's credibility with its customers and NACA's effectiveness
in the public debate on food safety legislation and regulation will be hurt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* * * Incorrectly designating these pesticides as carcinogens will cast doubt and suspicion on NACA and the entire
pesticide industry such that complete recovery_when the original determination is eventually reversed_will be
unlikely. (Ref. 17).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, based on these statements provided by the objectors, it is clear that all the objectors believe that a finding
that a pesticide induces cancer, in and of itself, has an irreparable and adverse effect. EPA believes that the objectors
have overstated the size of the impact from the induce cancer finding. EPA has regulated each of these pesticides for
years based on EPA's published conclusion that they pose a cancer risk. (Ref. 18). Nonetheless, given the breadth
of the adversely affected standard, EPA cannot conclude that an induce cancer finding in a rulemaking did not have
some additional adverse impact. Thus, EPA concludes that the objectors were adversely affected by EPA's induce cancer
finding announced in the April 1990 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the broad adversely affected standard, the objectors apparently argue that they were not adversely
affected by the April 1990 induce cancer finding. They suggest that they could not have been adversely affected in
1990 because EPA never proposed to change the status quo; and because EPA's 1993 Order proposes to change the status
quo, they are now irreparably injured. According to DuPont, for example,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[t]he proponents of the maintenance of the &sect;409 regulations were never ``adversely affected'' by an EPA position,
because no change was ever made or proposed to the status quo. (Ref. 19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several other objectors make similar assertions. (Ref. 20).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds this argument disingenuous. Having themselves made the case in their objections that the impact of an induce
cancer finding extends far beyond the specific legal consequences resulting from the revocation of a few tolerances,
the objectors cannot then cite the lack of direct legal consequences from the April 1990 Order on the regulations concerned
as the sole criterion for determining whether they were adversely affected by that Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA believes that any additional injury to objectors based on the revocation of a food additive regulation
is merely additive to what the objectors already describe as an irreparable injury. As is evidenced by the nature of
the objections quoted herein, none of these objectors argue injury based on the fact that farmers or other users would
cease to purchase their product because of a fear that use of the product would result in over-tolerance residues on
processed food. The objectors link the total of their injury to a Delaney clause taint. For example, DuPont, at one
point asserts that the revocation would cause ``confusion'' in the marketplace. But even here, DuPont tied that to
the Delaney clause taint:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The revocation of a &sect;409 regulation under the Delaney clause in a situation where there is no concentration necessitating
a &sect;409 tolerance will result in unwarranted concern and confusion among growers, food processors, consumers,
and the country's international trading partners. As a result, the use of benomyl on tomatoes and other crops could
be dramatically curtailed because of the ``taint'' of the Delaney Clause. (Ref. 21).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the objectors' statements clearly show that the stigma allegedly caused by an induce cancer finding is their
predominant, and possibly only, concern and thus the objectors' had sufficient incentive to challenge the April
1990 Order. Given that fact, the potentially greater effect linked to the more recent Orders does not excuse failure
to challenge the April 1990 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Essentiality of the Induce Cancer Finding in the April 1990 Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the doctrines permitting preclusion of issues finally decided, preclusion is appropriate when the resolution
of an issue was necessary or essential in the prior action and the persons being precluded from raising that issue had
a full and fair opportunity to challenge its prior resolution. EPA's April 1990 finding that the pesticides named
in the petition induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney clause was necessary for the Agency to respond to the
petition and the comments raised, and EPA specifically noted the opportunity to object to EPA's conclusions that
the named pesticides induce cancer. Thus, the objectors' failure to challenge EPA's resolution of that issue results
in a final determination, and the objectors must be barred from relitigating that issue. EPA believes that the objectors
may not now rely on that issue to support their challenge to EPA's July 1993 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the preclusion doctrines, findings necessary to an ultimate decision may be accorded finality and preclusive
effect in the same manner the ultimate decision would be if a fair and full opportunity to challenge the findings was
made available. (Ref. 22). Many of the objectors, however, argue that EPA's 1990 finding that the named pesticides
induce cancer was not necessary for EPA to respond to the petition and that the objectors were not afforded an opportunity
to challenge such a finding. According to DuPont,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[t]he basic issue of whether the pesticides subject to the NRDC petition ``induce cancer'' within the meaning of the
Delaney Clause was not critical to the Agency's response to the petition, because the regulations at issue fell within
de minimis levels, whether or not these chemicals ``induce cancer.'' (Ref. 23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several other objectors make similar objections. (Ref. 24).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectors apparently claim that EPA theoretically applied the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 doctrine_that EPA applied the doctrine only in the event that it later found any one of the named pesticides to be carcinogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the objectors' characterization of EPA's actions. An induce cancer finding was essential and
necessary to EPA's decision in response to the California petition. The California petition sought revocation of
various food additive regulations asserting that the pesticides covered by such regulations were animal carcinogens
and therefore the regulations violated the Delaney clause. EPA denied the petition on the ground that there was an
exception to the literal terms of the Delaney clause. Of course, EPA could not have reached the question of whether
there was an exception to the literal terms of the Delaney clause unless EPA first found that the literal terms of the
clause applied. EPA made it abundantly clear in its April 1990 Order and response to comments that EPA agreed with the
petitioners that the pesticides named in the petition are animal carcinogens. As noted earlier in this document,
at several points throughout its April 1990 Order, EPA explicitly corrected comments that the named pesticides do
not induce cancer. 55 FR 17566-67; see also 55 FR 17570, 17572-73.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it is apparent that the Ninth Circuit likewise considered the induce cancer issue an essential element of
EPA's Order when reaching its conclusion in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

cert denied
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit recited facts found by EPA which the court adopted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, * * * the EPA found these pesticides to be carcinogens. Notwithstanding the Delaney clause, the EPA refused
to revoke the earlier regulations, reasoning that, although the chemicals posed a measurable risk of causing cancer,
that risk was ``de minimis.'' (Ref. 25).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the court concluded that the induce cancer determination had been made even before the April 1990 Order. Significantly,
the court also rejected _on the ground that the induce cancer finding had already been made_EPA's refusal to revoke
the phosmet and mancozeb food additive regulations. EPA had argued in the February 1991 Order, that, because the carcinogenicity
classification of phosmet was tentative and because EPA's Special Review would address the cancer risks posed by
mancozeb, immediate revocation of either set of regulations under the Delaney clause was inappropriate. The court
concluded, however, that EPA's ongoing review of data relating to the carcinogenicity of phosmet and mancozeb ``cannot
countermand the application of the Delaney clause in light of the 1988 declaration, never revoked, that both of these
pesticides are carcinogenic.'' (Ref. 26).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectors also advance a somewhat circular argument to support their claim that EPA never provided the opportunity
to challenge its 1990 induce cancer finding. The objectors argue that they never had the opportunity to challenge
EPA's induce cancer findings because EPA relied on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 theory to deny the request to revoke the regulations and EPA never proposed the revocation of the regulations. Essentially,
the objectors are suggesting that although they are irreparably injured by the more recent induce cancer finding,
they were not adversely affected by EPA's 1990 induce cancer finding. Thus, the right to challenge EPA's 1990 finding
was never triggered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, EPA believes that the objectors themselves make the case that they were adversely affected by the
1990 induce cancer finding and may not now create a post hoc rationalization for the failure to challenge that finding.
Moreover, EPA finds both bases for the objectors' argument to be irrelevant given that EPA explicitly noted the opportunity
for objections on the induce cancer issue. In its response to comments on the induce cancer issue, EPA specifically
announced that it would consider objections and requests for a hearing on the issue of whether the named pesticides
induce cancer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[i]f objections and requests for hearing are submitted, the Administrator will determine whether there are factual
issues appropriate for resolution at an evidentiary hearing. The issues of whether the chemicals listed by the petition
induce cancer and whether the risks attributable to the uses identified in the petition are de minimis could be potential
factual matters for resolution at an administrative hearing. 1055 FR 17570.

See also 55 FR 17572, 17573. (EPA references above-quoted response in its response to other similar comments). In
fact, it is clear that the commenters understood the controversial nature of EPA's findings. As noted by several commenters,
an induce cancer finding may result in disputed factual issues, 55 FR 17570, and involve material issues of fact. 55
FR 17571. A strategic choice not to challenge such an admittedly controversial finding in an FFDCA proceeding is one
that bears many risks. One obvious and pertinent risk under FFDCA section 409 is that the finding will be accorded finality
and referenced in related administrative or judicial proceedings.

Thus, EPA clearly provided the objectors the opportunity to object and file hearing requests on the issue of whether
any of the named pesticides induce cancer. The objectors' apparently risky assumption that EPA would prevail in a
judicial setting on legal theories untested by the Agency does not excuse them from the responsibility to challenge
findings which they believe adversely affect them when the first opportunity to challenge arises.

New Evidence On the Induce Cancer Issue.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As detailed above, EPA believes that, based on the objectors' own arguments, they were adversely affected by EPA's
April 1990 Order finding that the named pesticides induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney clause. Precluding
the objectors from relying on the induce cancer issue to support a challenge to the later revocation Order is appropriate
because EPA's induce cancer findings were essential to its ultimate response to the petition and because the objectors
were provided an opportunity to challenge the Agency's conclusions. To ensure no manifest injustice by precluding
relitigation of these findings, EPA has reviewed the objectors' submissions to determine whether the objectors
submitted any new data justifying the reopening this issue. EPA believes that none of the submissions are sufficient
to grant a rehearing on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one of the objectors, DuPont, specifically argues that there is ``new'' evidence justifying a hearing on EPA's
finding that benomyl induces cancer. DuPont's claim that it has submitted ``new'' evidence regarding the cancer
determination on benomyl does not justify reopening this issue. DuPont's ``new'' evidence falls into four basic
categories: (1) a reexamination of the tumors from several cancer bioassays in mice; (2) an extensive discussion
of data on the mutagenicity of benomyl and several recent mutagenicity studies; (3) a short-term feeding study directed
at determining benomyl's mechanism of action; and (4) a literature survey concerning hepatoblastomas in Swiss mice.
Little of this evidence is new because, as discussed below, DuPont was aware of the data before it had lost its opportunity
to challenge EPA's induce cancer finding in the April 1990 Order. Objections and hearing requests on the April 1990
Order were required to be submitted by May 25, 1990. What little of the evidence may be ``new'' is merely cumulative
to the then existing database, or, at best, ``further support[s]'' that database. (Ref. 27).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reread of Tumor Slides
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. DuPont has submitted a report dated June 19, 1990, documenting a reexamination of the liver sections from two benomyl
cancer bioassays completed in the early 1980s. The report was prepared by an independent pathologist. (Ref. 28).
Even if it is conceded that a reexamination of older data could be classified as ``new data,'' DuPont clearly had substantial
information concerning what that reread of the tumor slides would disclose before the expiration of the period for
objections to the April 1990 Order. The report submitted by the independent pathologist reveals that (1) DuPont scientists
reread the tumor slides initially and presented their conclusions to the independent pathologist for review, (Ref.
29); (2) the independent pathologist received a ``project sheet'' for the tumor slide review from DuPont no later
than April 18, 1990 (Ref. 30); and (3) the independent pathologist agreed for the most part with the earlier conclusions
of the DuPont scientists (Ref. 31). Additionally, DuPont's scientists prepared a report on the reread of the tumor
slides by both the DuPont scientists and the independent pathologists. That report explicitly states that the scientists
``findings'' were given to ``management'' on May 18, 1990. (Ref. 32). Thus, DuPont's own submission shows that the
this evidence is not ``new.'' In any event, even assuming that DuPont somehow did not ``know'' the results of the reread
of the tumor slides until the June 19, 1990 completion date, by the exercise of due diligence DuPont should have know
by May 25, 1990. DuPont was put on notice in June 1989 by the California petition that the question of benomyl's carcinogenicity
was at issue. When DuPont did contract for an independent evaluation of the tumor slides that independent evaluation
appears to have been completed in roughly 2 months. (Ref. 33). Thus, there is no reason this information could not have
been prepared prior to the expiration of the objection period. Certainly, there is no scientific reason for the delay
because the scientific justification for the reexamination of the tumor slides_that the criteria for classifying
benign and malignant tumors had changed_had been extant since at least 1987. (Ref. 34). DuPont's delay in reevaluating
existing data cannot justify their failure to file a timely objection to the April 1990 Order.

Mutagenicity Report

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. DuPont has submitted two related reports addressing whether benomyl is mutagenic. (Ref. 35). DuPont also submitted
several mutagenicity studies for review which are dated later than May 25, 1990. (Ref. 36). The reports discuss hundreds
of mutagenicity studies done on benomyl and similar compounds over the last twenty years. The newly submitted studies
add little to the vast data already compiled by April 1990 on whether benomyl is mutagenic. Thus, the major thrust of
this mutagenicity report could have been raised in objections to the April 1990 Order.

28-Day Mouse Feeding Study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. DuPont has submitted a short-term feeding study with mice, dated June 27, 1990, which attempted to assess possible
mechanisms of liver tumor induction caused by benomyl. (Ref. 37). DuPont concluded that the ``results of this study
suggest that benomyl causes induction of a normal adaptive response that results in an increase in cell proliferation
and thus acts indirectly by modulating a high spontaneous incidence of mouse hepatic tumors through physiological
mechanisms and not as a direct acting carcinogen.'' (Ref. 38). Even assuming this information is relevant to the induce
cancer finding, this study is not so definitive as to justify reopening the induce cancer determination. Moreover,
this was a study conducted in-house by DuPont for which the actual experimental work was completed by March 30, 1990.
(Ref. 39). If the results of this study were indeed critical, DuPont had ample time to raise them in objections to EPA's
April 1990 Order.

 As adversely affected parties, the objectors' failure to file a challenge with EPA to the April 1990 Order bars them
from now challenging a finding essential to that Order_that the named pesticides are animal carcinogens. The objectors
must accept the consequences of the decision not to object to that April 1990 Order.

Remaining Hearing Requests and Objections.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The objectors raise several other objections and a hearing request pertaining to issues other than EPA's induce cancer
finding that are not necessarily barred by EPA's April 1990 Order. These objections and hearing requests are summarized
and addressed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Concentration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DuPont and the Mancozeb Task Force have objected to the revocation of the benomyl tolerance on raisins (DuPont) and
the mancozeb tolerances on raisins and bran of wheat (DuPont and Mancozeb Task Force) on the ground that these food
additive tolerances should be revoked because there is no concentration of residues for these pesticides in these
processed foods. Under existing EPA policy, EPA does not consider food additive tolerances necessary unless residues
of a pesticide concentrate during processing and therefore could exceed the raw food tolerance. DuPont and the Mancozeb
Task Force, contend that the respective benomyl and mancozeb regulations are not necessary under this policy and
EPA must make a determination on the concentration issue prior to reaching the Delaney clause question. DuPont has
also requested a hearing on the question of whether benomyl concentrates in tomato products. EPA disagrees with the
objectors on both legal and practical grounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, these objections and hearing requests suffer from a basic flaw: a challenge to an order under FFDCA section
409 must ``go to the legality of the agency's order.'' (Ref. 41). Arguing that there is an alternate ground for a revocation
action based on information or claims not resolved by EPA in the revocation does not challenge the legal basis of the
revocation. Here, EPA revoked the benomyl and mancozeb tolerances on the ground that these tolerances are barred
by the Delaney clause. That was the sole issue addressed by the July 1993 Order. EPA did not address whether the tolerances
were needed due to a concentration of residues during processing except to mention the irrelevancy of the issue to
that Order. Unlike the induce cancer issue, the question of whether benomyl concentrates during processing was not
an essential element of the July 1993 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectors appear to be contending that, even when EPA finds that a tolerance violates the core safety standard
in FFDCA section 409, EPA is legally barred from acting on that finding prior to determining whether there are some
other grounds for revoking the tolerance. DuPont claims that ``[t]he Agency must make a threshold determination
if a 409 regulation is necessary before even reaching the question of the applicability of the Delaney clause.'' (Ref.
42). DuPont cites three reasons why such a threshold determination is mandated. None has merit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DuPont first argues that ``if data demonstrate that there is no concentration of residues in processed food, there
is no reason to retain the &sect;409 food additive regulations.'' (Ref. 43) True, there may be ``no reason'' under
EPA's existing policy or given the flow-through provision of section 402 to retain such a food additive regulation,
but the regulation would not be barred as a legal matter by the flow-through provision. The flow-through provision
simply creates a safe harbor for residues in processed food which are at or below the section 408 raw food tolerance.
Thus, revocation of a food additive regulation where the pesticide does not concentrate in the processed food is driven
by policy not legal considerations. Second, DuPont asserts that a threshold determination on concentration must
be made because of the taint attached to the Delaney clause finding. This reason may explain why DuPont seeks revocation
on another ground; however, as stated above, it is not legal support for requiring EPA to first make a concentration
determination. Finally, DuPont claims that relying on the Delaney clause grounds to revoke the tolerance may cause
FDA to misallocate its enforcement resources because of public fears about cancer. Even assuming this to be true,
this reason is again nothing more than a policy reason for relying on lack of concentration rather than the Delaney
clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mancozeb Task Force makes similar policy arguments as to why EPA should revoke the mancozeb food additive tolerances
on concentration grounds. Like the arguments of DuPont, the Task Force's contentions do not attack the legal basis
for the revocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At bottom, DuPont and the Mancozeb Task Force are objecting because EPA has not taken action on their later petitions
to revoke these tolerances on lack of concentration grounds. EPA is acting on the one food additive tolerance (mancozeb
on raisins) where EPA had data which had already been reviewed showing that the tolerance was not needed under existing
policy. EPA, however, has not yet acted on the portions of the petitions filed by DuPont and the Mancozeb Task Force
which are inadequately supported by data or are premised on a change in a longestablished EPA policy. EPA sees no error
in acting first on the California petition since it was submitted nearly four years prior to the DuPont and Mancozeb
Task Force petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA denies DuPont's and the Mancozeb Task Force's objections to EPA's failure to revoke these tolerances on concentration
grounds and DuPont's hearing request on the same issue because they do not attack the legal basis of the July 1993 Order.
None of the policy arguments made by the objectors convince EPA that it would be appropriate to delay responding to
the California petition until the issues surrounding their petitions can be resolved.

The Classification of Raisins as a Processed Food.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DuPont has objected to the revocation of the benomyl food additive tolerance for raisins claiming that that tolerance
should be revoked because raisins are not a processed food but a raw agricultural commodity. DuPont argues raisin
tolerances should be established under section 408, not section 409. This objection is denied for the same reason
as the objection involving the concentration issue_proposing an alternate ground for revocation based on information
or claims not resolved in the revocation does not attack the legal basis of the July 1993 Order. Similarly, EPA does
not believe that it is obligated to rule on DuPont's petition to reclassify raisins prior to ruling on the California
petition, given that DuPont's petition was filed 4 years later.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedural Objections.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the objectors have raised various related procedural objections to EPA's July 1993 Order. Because these
alleged procedural errors all involve EPA's determination on the induce cancer question and because each of the objectors
are precluded from relitigating that issue, EPA believes if it committed any error, the error was harmless. Nevertheless,
because the objections raised call into question the operating procedures of both EPA and FDA over the last 40 years,
EPA will respond to them in some detail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectors' basic complaint is that following the decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA immediately issued a final order rather than a proposal seeking public comment on revoking the tolerances. The
objectors claim this violated EPA's regulations and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They are mistaken.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 409 of the FFDCA contains an elaborate procedure for the establishment, amendment, and revocation of food
additive tolerances. 21 U.S.C. 348; see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nader
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is basically a hybrid rulemaking scheme that marries some aspects of informal rulemaking with the adjudicative
hearing requirements of formal rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, the statute establishes a petition procedure whereby any person may request EPA to establish
a tolerance. 21 U.S.C. 348(b). It also requires EPA to establish, by regulation, the procedure for the amendment or
repeal of food additive tolerances. 21 U.S.C. 348(h). ``[S]uch procedure shall conform to the procedure provided
[in section 409] for the promulgation of such regulations.''

 40 CFR parts 177, 178 (establishing such regulations). When a petition is submitted, EPA is required to publish ``[n]otice
of regulation proposed by the petitioner * * * in general terms.'' 21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5); 21 CFR 177.88. EPA is commanded
to act on the petition by order within 180 days either establishing a tolerance regulation or denying the petition.
40 U.S.C. 348(c). EPA regulations allow EPA to issue a proposal prior to issuing a final order on the petition. Once
a final order is issued, adversely affected parties are allowed 30 days to file objections and request an adjudicative
hearing. Any EPA decision on the objections is then subject to judicial review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The steps followed by EPA in acting on the California petition have been described in detail above. These steps were
clearly in accordance with FFDCA section 409, and the objectors do not claim that they were not. However, as noted above,
the objectors argue that EPA violated its own regulations and the APA. The objectors claim that EPA regulations require
EPA to issue a proposal, in addition to a notice of a petition, prior to revoking a food additive regulation in response
to a petition from a member of the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. EPA's regulations clearly make it discretionary with the Administrator whether to issue a proposal
where it has received a petition. The pertinent regulation states: ``The Administrator may publish in the Federal
Register a proposal to establish a food additive regulation or to modify or revoke an existing food additive regulation,
on his or her own initiative or in response to a petition.'' (40 CFR 177.130(a); see 40 CFR 177.125(b); 53 FR 41128).
The objectors' allegations to the contrary have no basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also rejects the objectors' claim that the APA required a proposal in this case. Essentially, the objectors are
contending that, despite Congress' express inclusion in the FFDCA of an intricate procedural scheme involving both
an initial notice procedure and opportunity for a full 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 administrative hearing on the government's action, APA notice and comment rulemaking requirements must be followed
as well. As support for this argument, DuPont relies on the fact that EPA has generally issued proposals prior to revoking
a tolerance in the past. While this is true, it is a fact with little effect here because previous revocation actions
have nearly always been initiated by the Administrator. In those circumstances, both section 408 and 409 of the FFDCA
requires issuance of a proposal. 21 U.S.C. 346a(e) and 348(d). The more appropriate analogy for the revocations at
issue here are those procedures EPA follows generally when it receives a petition to establish, modify, or revoke
a food additive regulation. In those cases, as stated above, in accordance with FFDCA sections 408 and 409 and EPA regulations,
EPA issues a notice summarizing the petition followed by a final order. For example, nearly all of the roughly eight
to ten thousand tolerances and exemptions from a tolerance under section 408 and 409 were established in response
to petitions. In the overwhelming majority of cases, including the regulations involved in this Order, (Ref. 44),
EPA published a brief summary of the petition followed by a final rule. See, e.g., 44 FR 23932 (April 23, 1979) (notice
of filing of petition to establish a food additive regulation for phosmet (imidan) on cottonseed oil). Having taken
advantage of this procedure for over 30 years, see, e.g., 23 FR 118, and 2402 (January 7, 1958; April 12, 1958) (Rohm
&amp; Haas Co. petition on dicofol), the objectors quite understandably do not argue that this procedure violates
the APA and have not objected to EPA using it to establish tolerances established subsequent to the filing of objections
in this case. See, e.g., 59 FR 5108 (Feb. 3, 1994). (DuPont petition for tolerance for hexakis.) Yet, unless they take
that position, they necessarily must be contending that industry is entitled to more process under the rulemaking
provisions of the APA on tolerance revocation petitions than the public is on petitions seeking the establishment
of a tolerance legalizing pesticide residues in food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the objectors are in a poor position to argue they should have been given an additional opportunity to file
written comments with EPA. The objectors chose not to challenge EPA's April 1990 Order. A timely and proper objection
to the April 1990 Order would have entitled them to a full

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Substantive Due Process
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. DuPont argues that EPA's revocation action violates the constitutional doctrine of substantive due process because
the revocation is without scientific basis and thus is arbitrary. (Ref. 45). DuPont, however, already has a statutory
right to challenge the substance of EPA's action under the FFDCA. The Constitution provides nothing further in this
regard. EPA thus denies DuPont's constitutional argument for the same reasons it has denied DuPont's substantive
challenge to EPA's induce cancer finding.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is removing the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins in 40 CFR 185.6300. Data show the food additive
regulation is not needed because any residues of mancozeb on raisins are covered by the tolerance set for the corresponding
raw commodity (grapes). This rule responds to a petition submitted by the Mancozeb Task Force, which requested that
EPA revoke the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) authorizes EPA to establish maximum permissible
levels or ``tolerances'' for pesticide residues in or on foods. The FFDCA has separate provisions for tolerances
for raw agricultural commodities (RACs) and tolerances for processed foods. For pesticide residues in or on raw commodities,
EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from the requirement of tolerances when appropriate, under section 408.
21 U.S.C. 346a. In processed foods, food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues
are established under section 409. 21 U.S.C. 348. Section 409 tolerances are required, however, only for certain
pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 402(a)(2) of the FFDCA, no section 409 tolerance is required
if any pesticide residue in a processed food is equal to or below the tolerance for that pesticide in or on the RAC from
which it was derived. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through'' provision
because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to the processed food form. Thus, a section 409
tolerance is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when the concentration of the pesticide
residue in a processed food is greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the
processed food itself is treated or comes in contact with a pesticide.

B. Petitions to Revoke
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the State of California, Public Citizen, the AFL-CIO, and several
individuals filed a petition requesting that EPA revoke several food additive regulations (including the food additive
regulation for mancozeb on raisins) on the grounds that the regulations violated the Delaney clause in FFDCA section
409. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 14, 1993 (58 FR 37862), EPA revoked the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins; however, that revocation
has been stayed. Published elsewhere in the rules and regulations section of this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is EPA's latest Order responding to the petition. That Order addresses food additive regulations other than mancozeb
on raisins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 23, 1993, the Mancozeb Task Force, which includes E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, Elf Atochem North America,
Inc., and Rohm and Haas Co., filed a petition requesting revocation of the food additive regulations for raisins and
the brans of barley, oats, rye, and wheat. The petition was based on the assertion that the food additive regulations
were not needed since there was no concentration of residues in these processed commodities, and, consequently,
the corresponding tolerances on the raw agricultural commodities are adequate to cover residues in both raw and processed
foods.

 of May 19, 1993 (58 FR 29318), EPA issued the receipt of that petition in a notice of availability and requested public
comments on the petitioner's request and supporting materials. Contents of and comments received on that petition
regarding the requested action on raisins are described in the next section. The Agency has not yet finished its review

II. Revocation of the Food Additive Regulation for Mancozeb on Raisins
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mancozeb Task Force's petition requests revocation of the section 409 tolerance for mancozeb on raisins, on the
basis of data showing that residues in grapes do not concentrate in raisins. The Task Force cited two studies reflecting
six different use patterns. In all cases, mancozeb residues were lower in raisins than in the raw commodity, grapes.
In addition to the petition, the Mancozeb Task Force filed comments in response to the May 19, 1993 Federal Register
notice, where they reiterated their position and the significance of the supporting data. No other comments were
filed in response to the May 19, 1993 notice of availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the petitioner's assertion that the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins is not needed
since the data show that levels of mancozeb on typically processed raisins are lower than those in the unprocessed
grapes. The study used as a basis for setting the original food additive regulation was not reflective of the current
typical processing practices which include washing of raisins as one of the processing steps. Subdivision O Residue
Chemistry Guidelines require that the processing data submitted reflect typical processing practices (Refs. 1
and 2: U.S. EPA, Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision O, Residue Chemistry, p. 21, October 1982 and Considine
Considine, eds., Foods and Food Production Encyclopedia, p. 1640 (1982)). Information currently available confirms
that raisins are typically washed as a part of normal processing. In 1990, prior to the submission of their petition,
the Mancozeb Task Force submitted a new processing study which did simulate commercial processing including washing
of the raisins (Ref. 3: U.S. EPA, MRID 41483801). In an EPA review of those data, completed on August 11, 1992, EPA concluded
that ``residues of mancozeb concentrated up to 30x in raisin waste but did not concentrate in raisins, wet pomace,
dry pomace, or juice'' (Ref. 4: U.S. EPA, Memorandum from Edward Zager, Health Effects Division, EPA to Lois Rossi,
Reregistration Branch, EPA, ``Mancozeb Update to Reregistration Standard,'' p. 106 (August 11, 1992)). A copy of
this EPA review is located in the OPP docket, the location of which is given under the ``Addresses'' section earlier
in this document. EPA determined that ``the established food additive tolerance for mancozeb on raisins is not needed
and should be revoked'' (Ref. 5: Same as Ref. 4, p. 107).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's current policy mandates that we compare the residues in processed commodities to the residues in the raw agricultural
commodities to determine whether concentration occurs. In this case, the residues in raisins, which have been washed
during normal commercial processing are compared to the residues in unwashed grapes. Since the data show that levels
of mancozeb on typically processed raisins are lower than those in the unprocessed grapes, EPA is granting the Mancozeb
Task Force's petition as to the revocation of the section 409 food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Filing of Objections and Requests for Hearings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person adversely affected by this Order may file written objections to the Order, and may include with any such
objection a written request for an evidentiary hearing on the objection. Such objections must be submitted to the
Hearing Clerk at the address listed under ``ADDRESSES'' on or before August 1, 1994. Copies of such objections should
be filed with the OPP docket for this action. Regulations applicable to objections and requests for hearings are set
out at 40 CFR parts 178 and 179. Those regulations require, among other things, that objections specify with particularity
the provisions of the Order objected to, the basis for the objections, and the relief sought. Additional requirements
as to the form and manner of the submission of objections are set out at 40 CFR 178.25. The Administrator will respond
as set forth in 40 CFR 178.30, 178.35 and/or 178.37 to objections that are not accompanied by a request for evidentiary
hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A person may include with any objection a written request for an evidentiary hearing on the objection. A hearing request
must include a statement of the factual issues on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each
such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. A copy of any hearing requests filed with the Hearing
Clerk should also be filed with the OPP docket for this action. Additional requirements as to the form and manner of
submission of requests for an evidentiary hearing are set out at 40 CFR 178.27. Under 40 CFR 178.32(c), the Administrator,
where appropriate, will make rulings on any issues raised by an objection if such issues must be resolved prior to determining
whether a request for an evidentiary hearing should be granted. The Administrator will respond to requests for evidentiary
hearings as set forth in 40 CFR 178.30, 178.32, 178.35, 178.37, and/or 179.20. Under 40 CFR 178.32(b), a request for
an evidentiary hearing on an objection will be granted if the objection and request have been properly submitted and
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted show: (1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of
fact for resolution at a hearing; (2) there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the
requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor; and (3) resolution of
one or more of the factual issues in the manner sought by the person requesting the hearing would be adequate to justify
the action requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person wishing to comment on any objections or requests may submit such comments to the Hearing Clerk on or before
August 15, 1994. A copy of such comments should also be filed with the OPP docket for this action.

IV. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 1735, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (or review by the Office of Budget and Management).
Section 3(f) defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more, or adversely or materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) create serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impacts
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' within the meaning of that term as defined in section
3(f) of Executive Order 12866. EPA is taking this action because it has determined that the subject food additive regulation
is not needed; the Agency believes that mancozeb, when used according to the label instructions, will not result in
residues on raisins that exceed the section 408 tolerance prescribed to cover mancozeb residues from the use on grapes.
Therefore, the Agency expects no economic impact will result.

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires EPA to analyze
regulatory options to assess the economic impact on small businesses, small governments and small organizations.
As explained above, the Agency believes there will be no economic impact on small businesses, governments and organizations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 1, 1993, the Office of Administration and Resources Management instituted new mail codes for EPA headquarters
offices. This notice is amending the PCB regulations at 40 CFR part 761 to replace references to old mail codes with
the appropriate new codes. These references occur at 761.19, 761.185, 761.187, and 761.205. In addition, reference
is also made to obsolete room numbers at 761.185, 761.187 and 761.205. These room numbers are being eliminated from
those sections. References to room numbers are not being updated, as they are unnecessary for the delivery of mail,
and further, they are likely to be changed again in the future.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS amends the regulations protecting sea turtles to allow compliance with tow-time limits as an alternative to
the use of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) by shrimp trawlers in a 30-square mile (48.3-square km) area off the coast
of North Carolina (North Carolina Restricted Area) through November 30, 1994. This area seasonally exhibits high
concentrations of red and brown algae that make trawling with TEDs impracticable. This final rule authorizes a 30-minute
tow limit through August 15, 1994; a 55-minute tow limit from August 16 through October 31, 1994; and a 75-minute tow
limit from November 1 through November 30, 1994, to allow shrimp trawlers to harvest shrimp efficiently during their
traditional shrimping season (March through November) and maintain adequate protection for sea turtles in this
area.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (ESA), U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Incidental capture by shrimp trawlers has been documented for five species of sea turtles that occur in offshore waters
of North Carolina. Sea turtle conservation regulations at 50 CFR parts 217 and 227 require all shrimp trawlers, regardless
of length, in offshore waters of the Atlantic Area, including off North Carolina, to have an approved TED installed
year-round in each net rigged for fishing, unless specifically exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has allowed shrimpers in the North Carolina restricted area to limit tow-times, rather than use TEDs, due to the
presence of algae that makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable. A comprehensive list of cites relating
to this exemption is as follows: 57 FR 33452 (July 29, 1992); 57 FR 40859 (September 8, 1992); 57 FR 45986 (October 6,
1992); 57 FR 52735 (November 5, 1992); 57 FR 57968 (December 8, 1992); 58 FR 19631 (April 12, 1993); 58 FR 28793 (May 12,
1993); 58 FR 33219 (June 11, 1993); 58 FR 38537 (July 13, 1993); and 58 FR 43820 (August 18, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS proposed a permanent exemption on May 25, 1993 (58 FR 30007), and a discussion of special environmental conditions,
an assessment of the algae problem, a history of the local fishery, and a discussion of tow times can be found there.
Comments received on the proposed rule were addressed in an interim final rule extending the tow-time allowance through
November 30, 1993 (September 21, 1993, 58 FR 48975). No comments were received on the most recent interim final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule implements the exemption through November 30, 1994, instead of permanently, as provided in the proposed
rule. NMFS decided to implement this final rule only for the current fishing season for several reasons. First, NMFS
believes that close review of algae conditions and tow time compliance is necessary to ensure that the exemption is
effective in preventing incidental takes. Second, NMFS is considering implementation of an incidental take permit
system under section 10 of the ESA that could authorize this exemption through an incidental take permit. An incidental
take permit would require periodic NMFS review and a conservation plan, thereby ensuring consistent enforcement
and mitigation of any incidental takes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS' review of the North Carolina restricted area exemption program for the 1992&hyph;1993 season indicates that
sea turtle mortalities do not appear to be associated with the allowance of tow times in lieu of TEDs. NMFS has reached
this conclusion based on the lack of observer-documented takes, the observed compliance with tow-time restrictions,
the cooperation of the fishermen, the small number of participants in the fishery, and the local knowledge required
to trawl in the restricted area without losing gear on bottom obstructions (which effectively limits entry into the
fishery). These factors are discussed in previous temporary rules and in the proposed rule (see above citations).
NMFS is particularly concerned about possible interactions between shrimping operations and turtles during the
turtle nesting season. NMFS will continue to monitor this situation during the remainder of the 1994 shrimping season.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on information received during the 1992&hyph;1993 season, NMFS has determined that algal concentrations
may be characteristic of the restricted area or may recur in an intermittent or unpredictable pattern and, thus, render
TED-use impracticable. NMFS will continue to monitor algal concentrations to determine whether these concentrations
are consistently problematic or whether there are times or seasons when TEDs could be used. Shrimp trawling observed
out of Sneads Ferry, NC, on April 28, 1994, confirmed the presence of algal concentrations sufficient to clog three
of four Anthony Weedless TEDs used in the observed tows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes effective for the remainder of the traditional shrimping season, through November 30, 1994, the policies
and procedures that were temporarily in effect in the North Carolina restricted area under previous exemptions.
Specifically, under this final rule, tow times in the North Carolina restricted area are limited to 30 minutes through
August 15; 55 minutes from August 16 through October 31; and 75 minutes from November 1 through November 30, 1994. These
measures should not, in the long run, significantly impact fishermen's normal trawl times, since heavy algae concentrations
characteristic of the warmer months cause fishermen to voluntarily shorten tow times to approximately 15&hyph;30
minutes. When algal concentrations are light, shrimpers usually opt to use TEDs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, under this final rule, registration with the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), is required
before a vessel may trawl in the restricted area, and vessels using the tow-time alternative are required to carry
a NMFS-approved observer if requested to do so by the Regional Director. The observer will monitor compliance with
required conservation measures, including restricted tow times, and resuscitation of any captured turtles in accordance
with 50 CFR 227.72(e)(1)(i). Data collected by observers may be used for enforcement purposes. Violations of tow-time
restrictions documented by North Carolina enforcement officers may be prosecuted under the ESA by the Office of the
General Counsel, NMFS, Southeast Region. In addition, violators may face prosecution under State law. NMFS and North
Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) will jointly monitor compliance with the tow-time alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule makes a technical correction to the general tow-time provision of 50 CFR 227.72(e)(3)(i).
The interim rule published September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48977) inadvertently amended this section to apply only to 1993.
This final rule revises the general tow time provision to apply every year, as intended.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 50 CFR 227.72(e) (3) and (6), the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA)
may modify the required conservation measures by publishing notification in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, if necessary, to ensure adequate protection of endangered and threatened sea turtles. Under this procedure, the
AA would impose any necessary additional or more stringent measures, including more restrictive tow times, synchronized
tow times, or termination of the tow-time alternative, if the AA determines that: (1) The concentration of algae no
longer makes trawling with TEDs impracticable; (2) there is insufficient compliance with the required conservation
measures; (3) compliance cannot be monitored effectively; (4) significant or unanticipated levels of lethal or
non-lethal takings or strandings of sea turtles have occurred in or near the North Carolina restricted area; or (5)
the incidental take level, authorized by biological opinion, of one mortality of Kemp's ridley, green, hawksbill,
or leatherback turtles, or two mortalities of loggerhead turtles attributable to shrimp fishing in the North Carolina
restricted area is met or exceeded during the exemption period.

for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that the proposed
rule if adopted would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result,
a final regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FMP and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 663) provide for rapid changes to specific management measures
that have been designated routine. Trip landing and frequency limits for the DTS complex are among those management
measures that have been designated as routine at 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1). Implementation and further adjustment of those
measures may occur after consideration at a single Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A trip limit is defined at 50 CFR 663.2 as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex by weight, or by percentage of weight of fish
on board, that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed from a single fishing trip.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified
period of time, without a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 apply to calendar
months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 1, 1994, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex was set at 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) per month, including
no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) of thornyheads and 12,000 lb (5,443 kg) of trawl-caught sablefish. In any landing
of the DTS complex, the trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish was set at 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 25 percent of the DTS complex,
whichever was greater, and applied to each trip. In any landing, no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) could be trawl-caught
sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length) (59 FR 685, January 6, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to simplify the percentage portion of the trip limit, on May 6, 1994, NMFS restated it in equivalent terms that
are easier to calculate_25 percent of the DTS complex (including sablefish) is equivalent to 33.333 percent (approximately
one third) of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole (i.e., the DTS complex excluding sablefish) (59 FR 23638, May 6,
1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DTS are managed collectively as the DTS complex because they are often caught together in the trawl fishery. Information
on DTS complex landings indicated that at the current rate of harvest, the harvest guidelines for thornyheads and
trawl-caught sablefish would be achieved well before the end of the year. The Council, therefore, convened an emergency
tele-conference Council meeting to consider the issue on June 17, 1994. The best available information presented
at the June 17, 1994, teleconference Council meeting indicated that the trawl catch of sablefish through May 28, 1994,
was 1,803 mt or 51 percent of the 1994 trawl allocation, and that the catch rate for trawl-caught sablefish during April-May
1994 was 112 percent of the catch rate average for this period in 1992 and 1993. The data also indicated that the catch
of thornyheads through May 28, 1994, was 3,829 mt or 55 percent of the 1994 harvest guideline for thornyheads. High
thornyhead prices to the fishers have attracted much greater effort, and the recent rate of thornyhead landings was
78 percent above the 1992&hyph;1993 catch rate average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, if landing rates are not curtailed, the harvest guideline for trawl-caught sablefish (3,521 mt) would
be taken near August 26, 1994, and the harvest guideline for thornyheads (7,000 mt) would be taken near August 7, 1994.
In order to delay the achievement of the harvest guidelines, the Council recommended imposing an immediate reduction
in the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex from 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) to 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per calendar month.
Within this limit, no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) may be thornyheads (down from 30,000 lb (13,608 kg)) and no more than
6,000 lb (2,722 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish (down from 12,000 lb (5,443 kg)). The individual trip limit for trawl-caught
sablefish of 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater, and
the 5,000 pound (2,268 kg) limit on trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length) remain unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sharp increase in monthly catch of thornyheads and sablefish has been associated with a decrease in the monthly
catch of Dover sole. The reduction in the thornyhead cumulative limit is expected to greatly reduce the magnitude
and frequency of trips in deep water. The shift in effort to shallow water should increase the catch of Dover sole and
decrease the catch of thornyheads, but sablefish are caught in association with both species. Because the sablefish
limit has been reduced to 6,000 lb (2,721 kg), the reduction in the DTS complex limit from 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) to 30,000
lb (13,608 kg) is designed to prevent increases in sablefish discard as vessels increase targeting on Dover sole.

NMFS hereby announces the following change to the management measures announced at 59 FR 685, January 6, 1994, pursuant
to 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Coastwide, no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) cumulative of the DTS complex may be taken and retained, possessed,
or landed per vessel in a calendar month, of which no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) cumulative of thornyheads and 6,000
lb (2,722 kg) cumulative of trawl-caught sablefish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a
calendar month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In any trip, no more than 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is
greater, may be trawl-caught sablefish; and no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish smaller
than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the
determination is based are available for public inspection at the Office of the Regional Director, Northwest Region,

Delay in the implementation of this action could result in exceeding the trawl-caught sablefish allocation and/or
exceeding the thornyhead limited entry harvest guideline. Furthermore, there was an opportunity for public comment
at the June 17 Council meeting. The Secretary therefore finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) to
waive the requirements for publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking and a 30-day delay in effectiveness
for this action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 7, 1991, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated maximum contaminant level goals
(MCLGs) and national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) for lead and copper (``lead and copper rule'')
(56 FR 26460). Subsequently, EPA published two technical amendments to the lead and copper rule correcting typographical
errors and clarifying the Agency's intent (56 FR 32113, July 15, 1991; 57 FR 28785, June 19, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action corrects errors in the lead and copper regulations and the preamble discussion of the copper health
effects, and clarifies the intent of the regulatory requirements in cases where the language was confusing. Today's
action also reinstates special primacy condition language in the rule that was inadvertently deleted when a section
of another rulemaking action (the Agency's ``Phase II rule'') became effective on July 30, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553, provide that when an Agency finds good cause to exist, it
may issue a rule without first providing notice and comment and make the rule immediately effective. Under the APA,
good cause for not receiving public comment is present where notice and comment is impracticable, unnecessary or
contrary to the public interest. Today's action corrects errors and omissions in 40 CFR parts 141 and 142. These technical
revisions are minor and do not impact any substantive obligations of public water systems or States. The Agency therefore
finds that neither comment nor a delayed effective date is necessary or in the public interest. Accordingly, EPA finds
that there is good cause not to solicit comment on this notice and to have the revisions effective immediately.

A. Clarification and Update to Preamble Explanation of Copper MCLG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The preamble to the final lead/copper NPDWR in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contained EPA's rationale for setting the Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) for copper at 1.3 milligrams per
liter (mg/L). In referencing the medical and epidemiological literature regarding health risks posed by copper,
EPA provided an incomplete discussion that is corrected. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
On 56 FR 26471, it is stated that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``This MCLG of 1.3 mg/L is based on a Lowest Observed Adverse Health Effect Level (LOAEL) of 5.3 mg/day from human clinical
case studies in which 5.3 mg was the lowest acute oral dose at which gastrointestinal effects were seen (Chuttani et
al., 1965).'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chuttani et al. described the clinical course and treatment of patients who were hospitalized after suicidal ingestion
of large quantities of copper sulfate (>250 mg). In fact, the 5.3 mg/day LOAEL was derived in EPA's Drinking Water Criteria
Document for copper (EPA, 1987; p.VIII&hyph;10) from analysis of a number of studies, briefly summarized here, in
which individuals developed gastrointestinal illnesses after ingesting much lower levels of copper than in the
Chuttani et al. study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyllie (1957) treated nurses for acute effects of copper poisoning (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) caused by the dissolution
of copper contained in a cocktail shaker. Analysis of cocktail fluid prepared in the shaker allowed an estimate of
the amounts of copper ingested (5.3&hyph;32 mg copper; EPA, 1987, p. VI&hyph;6). The following day, 10 of the 15 nurses
were still too ill to resume their duties and suffered from weakness, abdominal cramps, dizziness, and headaches.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar findings cited in the Criteria Document were reported among British workers who experienced nausea, diarrhea,
and vomiting after ingesting single dosages of approximately 7&hyph;10 mg copper in their tea (EPA, 1987, p. VIII&hyph;9;
Semple et al., 1960; Nicholas and Brist, 1968). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spitalny et al. (1984) reported that one adult and two children, ages 5 and 7, of a Vermont family had recurrent episodes
of vomiting and gastrointestinal pain after drinking water in a newly built home which contained 2.8 to 8 mg/L copper.
In addition, the Centers for Disease Control reported 112 cases of copper intoxication between 1977 and 1982. The
majority of cases involved leaching of copper into drinking water from plumbing with reported copper levels ranging
from 4.0&hyph;70 mg/L (CDC, 1977&hyph;1982; EPA, 1987, p. VIII&hyph;8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other epidemiological and controlled exposure studies, cited in the 1987 Criteria Document, have found
acute copper intoxication associated with higher exposure levels among a wide variety of populations. Based on a
review of human and animal toxicity, including the studies summarized above, the Criteria Document concluded (p.
VIII&hyph;15): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
``A level of 1.3 mg/L is recommended to be the basis for the drinking water standard for the following reasons: 1) this
level would satisfy the nutritional requirements for copper: the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 1980) estimated
that ``an adequate and safe'' intake of 2&hyph;3 mg copper in a 70 kg adult and 1.5&hyph;2.5 mg/day for children will
satisfy nutritional requirements and be protective of human health; and 2) assuming consumption of 2 L of water per
day, 1.3 mg/L copper in the drinking water would result in a daily intake of less than the lowest levels that were seen
to result in gastrointestinal effects in humans (5.3 mg/day, 3&hyph;8 mg/L). This value would thus be protective
against acute toxic effects in humans. This value is not protective against copper toxicity in sensitive members
of the population, such as those rare individuals with Wilson's disease. These individuals would have to further
limit their intake of copper from all sources.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have been raised by some States as to how the Agency intended to regulate small-size water systems (those
serving 3,300 or fewer people) and medium-size water systems (those serving between 3,301 and 50,000 people) that
meet the lead and copper action levels during the first two monitoring periods (and therefore are deemed to have optimized
corrosion control), but that exceed one of the action levels in a subsequent monitoring period. As discussed below,
it was clearly the Agency's intent in promulgating this rule to require these systems (where exceedance of one of the
action levels indicates that they may not have optimized corrosion control) to implement the rules' corrosion control
treatment requirements as long as they exceed the action level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141.81(b)(1) specifies that small- and medium-size water systems are deemed to have optimized corrosion
control once they meet both the lead and copper action levels for two consecutive six-month monitoring periods conducted
in accordance with &sect;141.86. Sections 141.81(a)(2) and 141.81(c) specify that such systems may forego (or cease)
completion of the corrosion control treatment steps specified in &sect;141.81(e). This language is consistent
with EPA's intent, as discussed in the preamble to the final rule (56 FR 26490&hyph;26497), that small- and medium-size
water systems not be required to conduct corrosion control studies and install additional treatment as long as they
meet both the lead and copper action levels because the action levels reflect optimal corrosion control treatment
for these systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141.81(e)(1) requires that small- and medium-size systems conduct tap sampling for lead and copper until
the system becomes eligible for reduced monitoring (because it has met the action levels during the requisite number
of monitoring periods) or the system exceeds the action level. If such a system exceeds the action level, it is then
required to begin the corrosion control treatment steps within a certain period of time of the exceedance. Thus, under
the current rule, a system that meets the action levels during the first two monitoring periods (and any number of subsequent
monitoring periods) is triggered into the corrosion control treatment requirements if it at any time exceeds the
lead or copper action level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding this provision, some States have apparently been confused by the language in &sect;141.81(c) of
the rule, which addresses small and medium-size systems that initially exceed one of the action levels, but subsequently
reduce their levels to below the action levels and are therefore deemed to have optimized corrosion control. With
regard to these systems, the second sentence of &sect;141.81(c) states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
``If any such water system thereafter exceeds the lead or copper action level during any monitoring period, the system
(or the State, as the case may be) shall recommence completion of the applicable treatment steps, beginning with the
first treatment step which was not previously completed in its entirety. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Some parties have apparently questioned whether the phrase ``any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
such
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 water system'' (emphasis added) could be read to exclude small- and medium-size water systems meeting &sect;141.81(b)(1)
criteria during the initial two six-month monitoring periods from having to begin implementing the corrosion control
treatment steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As evident from the language in &sect;141.81(e) of the rule, this was not EPA's intent. To clarify this point, EPA has
added a sentence at the end of &sect;141.81(c) stating: ``The requirement for any small- or medium-size system to
implement corrosion control treatment steps in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section (including systems
deemed to have optimized corrosion control under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is triggered whenever any small-
or medium-size system exceeds the lead or copper action level.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141.87 contains the monitoring requirements for water quality parameters. The introductory text in the
section states that, ``[a]ll large water systems and all small and medium-size water systems that exceed the lead
or copper action level shall monitor water quality parameters in addition to lead and copper in accordance with this
section.'' As written, this sentence could be read to mean that only large water systems exceeding the lead or copper
action level must collect water quality parameter samples. This interpretation is not consistent with the intent
of the final regulation. EPA's intent is clear in the preamble of the final rule (56 FR 26526 bottom of middle column)
which contains the same sentence, with a comma after the phrase ``all large systems''. EPA's intent is to require all
large water systems to install optimal corrosion control treatment regardless of lead and copper tap water levels.
Because the lead and copper action levels are not surrogate measures of optimal corrosion control treatment for large
water systems, these systems must collect water quality parameter samples to determine if optimal treatment has
been installed, and to establish baseline parameters for continued compliance. The State must evaluate the water
quality data submitted by each water system and establish enforceable parameters that the system must maintain to
remain in compliance with the rule. EPA is correcting the regulatory language by adding a comma after the phrase, ``all
large systems'' so that it is clear that all large systems must conduct water quality parameter monitoring, regardless
of whether they exceed the lead or copper action level.

The chart entitled ``Analytical Methods'' in &sect;141.89(a) contains typographical errors in the methodology
listing for orthophosphate. The chart was printed correctly in the preamble (56 FR 26510). The corrected chart is
included in this notice. In addition, EPA is updating the chart to refer to methods at &sect;141.89(a) which are contained
in the current editions of (1) EPA drinking water methods manuals, (2) Standard Methods, and (3) the American Society
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Annual Book of Standards. Compared to the earlier version of a method, the version
now cited at &sect;141.89(a) is the same. EPA method 300.0, which had been published individually, is now reprinted
in a manual issued by EPA in 1993. EPA methods 200.7, 200.8, and 200.9 are now reprinted in a manual published in 1991.
The EPA methods, the methods in the 18th edition of Standard Methods, and in the 1993 ASTM book contain changes to the
previous versions that are typographical, grammatical, or editorial in nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion or republication of methods in new manuals or books requires the following changes to footnotes at &sect;141.89(a).
Footnote 1 is updated to include the NTIS order number. Footnotes 2 and 3 are updated to the 18th edition of Standard
Methods and the 1993 ASTM book, and are renumbered as footnotes 3 and 4. The methods in footnotes 5, 6, and 7 are contained
in the manual cited at the new footnote 2. Footnote 6, which explains when to digest water samples for total metals,
is revised slightly to be identical to the same explanatory footnote for other metals, which is found at &sect;141.23(k).
Footnote 9 has also been renumbered as footnote 6. Footnote 8 has been revised to cite the manual which now contains
Method 300.0. Footnotes 7, 9 and 10 are reserved. Footnote 11 has been added because that method is now found in a different
reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Practical Quantitation Levels (PQLs) for lead and copper are defined in &sect;141.89(a). EPA has received input
from State drinking water programs and laboratories that the value of these PQLs are not clearly stated in &sect;141.89(a)(1)(ii)
and that it is unclear whether the numbers in paragraphs 141.89(a)(3) and 141.89(a)(4) refer to the PQL or one-half
the PQL. The PQLs are 0.005 mg/L for lead and 0.050 mg/L for copper. The basis for these PQLs is discussed in the preamble
to the final rule (56 FR 26511). EPA is revising &sect;141.89(a)(1)(ii) to clearly reflect the PQL of 0.005 mg/L for
lead in subparagraph (A) and the PQL of 0.050 mg/L for copper in subparagraph (B). In addition, EPA is revising &sect;141.89(a)(3)
to consolidate &sect;&sect;141.89 (3) and (4) and to reference the lead and copper PQLs defined in &sect;141.89(a)(1)(ii).

Section 141.90(g) requires that any monitoring data collected in addition to that required by 40 CFR part 141, subpart
I (The Lead and Copper Rule) be submitted by the end of the reporting period. This could be construed as inconsistent
with the other paragraphs of &sect;141.90, which require that monitoring data be submitted within ten days of the
end of the monitoring period. The ten-day delay is allowed for processing, collating and reporting of data. EPA did
not intend this inconsistency. To make &sect;141.90(g) consistent with other reporting requirements in &sect;141.90,
EPA is amending &sect;141.90(g) to allow ten days for submittal of additional data.

Section 142.16(d) was reserved effective July 30, 1992, but should contain the special primacy requirements specific
to the lead and copper rule that States are required to adopt in addition to meeting basic primacy requirements. As
explained in the July 15, 1991 (56 FR 32112) technical correction, EPA intended the lead and copper special primacy
requirements to take effect July 7, 1991. On July 30, 1992, changes to &sect;142.16 promulgated as part of the Phase
II rulemaking (56 FR 3526, January 30, 1991) took effect. The Phase II regulations made changes to &sect;142.16, reserved
paragraph (d) and added paragraph (e). These changes to &sect;142.16 had the unintended effect of deleting paragraph
(d). The Agency did not intend to delete the lead and copper special primacy requirements. Rather, the Agency's intent
in reserving paragraph (d) as a part of the Phase II rulemaking was to establish a placeholder for lead and copper special
primacy requirements when the lead and copper regulations were promulgated. EPA is therefore repromulgating &sect;142.16(d)
without revisions to restore the special primacy requirements initially promulgated in the final lead and copper
rule.

Section 142.62(g)(2) contains a typographical error in the reference to regulations pertaining to maximum contaminant
levels (MCLs) and quality limits for bottled water. ``21 CFR 102.35'' should be ``21 CFR 103.35''. EPA is correcting
this error in today's action.

6Samples may not be filtered. Samples that contain less than 1 NTU(nephelometric turbidity unit) and are properly
preserved (concentrated nitric acid to pH&lt;2) may be analyzed directly (without digestion) for total metals,
otherwise, digestion is required. Turbidity must be measured on the preserved samples just prior to the initiation
of metal analysis. When digestion is required, the total recoverable technique as defined in the method must be used.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule amends part 135 to implement the comprehensive changes made to section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 3, as amended, requires that
economic opportunities generated by certain HUD financial assistance for housing (including public and Indian
housing) and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be given to low- and very low-income
persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing, and to businesses that provide
economic opportunities for these persons.

II. Procedural Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations contained in this interim rule are based on the proposed rule published on October 8, 1993, and take
into consideration public comment received on the proposed rule. The Department has made a number of changes to the
section 3 regulations in response to public comment. Because of the changes made to the October 8, 1993 proposed rule,
the Department is publishing the new section 3 regulations as an interim rule, rather than a final rule. Although the
interim rule will be effective 30 days from the date of publication, as would a final rule, the Department solicits
additional public comment, and public comment will be taken into consideration in development of the final rule.

III. Background_Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52534), the Department published a proposed rule that would implement section 3 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968 (section 3) (12 U.S.C. 1701u), as amended by the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (1992 Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since its enactment, section 3 has been a statutory basis for promoting the award of jobs and contracts, generated
from projects receiving HUD financial assistance, to, respectively, low-income residents and businesses of the
areas where the projects to be assisted are located. Although the 1992 Act significantly revised section 3, it did
not alter the objective of section 3_to provide economic opportunities to low-income persons. The 1992 Act strengthens
the section 3 mandate by clarifying the types of HUD financial assistance, activities, and recipients subject to
the requirements of section 3; identifying the specific individuals and businesses who are the intended beneficiaries
of the economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities; and establishing the order of priority in
which these individuals and businesses should be recruited and solicited for the employment and other economic opportunities
generated from HUD-assisted activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the comprehensive changes made to section 3 by the 1992 Act, the October 8, 1993 rule proposed to amend
part 135 in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 8, 1993 proposed rule provided for implementation of section 3 in each of HUD's three principal program
areas: (1) Public and Indian housing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) housing; and (3) community development. The proposed rule specified the types of efforts to be undertaken in these
three programs to comply with the training, employment and contracting preferences required by section 3, and the
responsibilities imposed on recipients to ensure compliance with the section 3 requirements in their own operations
and the operations of their contractors and subcontractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the October 8, 1993 proposed rule expired on December 8, 1993, but comments were accepted through
December 31, 1993. By this date, 63 comments were received. The commenters included housing authorities, units of
government of State and local jurisdictions, non-profit organizations, legal organizations, and organizations
representing public housing residents and other low-income persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the commenters were critical of one or more aspects of the rule. Housing authorities and State and local
jurisdictions criticized the rule for being overly burdensome, and for failing to appreciate the administrative
time and cost involved in undertaking the efforts required to provide training, employment and contracting opportunities
to low-income persons. Legal organizations and other organizations representing low-income residents stated
that the rule failed to provide clear standards and requirements by which recipients and contractors could achieve
compliance with section 3, and as a result, economic opportunities would not be directed to low- and very low-income
persons as required by section 3. Several commenters submitted lengthy comments on the proposed rule. Almost all
commenters offered suggestions and recommendations on how implementation of section 3 should be conducted. The
suggestions, recommendations, issues and questions submitted by commenters are discussed in Sections V and VI of
the preamble.

IV. Clarification of Purpose and Applicability of Section 3_Providing Preference When Economic Opportunities
Are Generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before discussion of the issues and suggestions raised by commenters, the Department wants to clarify the purpose
and applicability of section 3. Certain questions and issues raised by several commenters made the Department aware
that there is some confusion about the purpose of section 3 and when the training, employment and contracting preferences
of section 3 are applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that they did not have the funds to initiate job training and apprenticeship programs,
and they did not need to employ additional personnel or contract for work. Section 3 does not require the creation of
economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons, or for anyone, simply for the sake of creating economic
opportunities. Section 3 requires that when employment or contract opportunities are generated because a project
or activity undertaken by a recipient of HUD financial assistance necessitates the employment of additional personnel
through individual hiring or the awarding of contracts for work, the recipient must give preference in hiring to low-
and very low-income persons, and must give preference in contracting to businesses owned by these persons or that
substantially employ low- and very low-income persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the need to employ additional personnel or to contract for work occurs (which is frequently the case when HUD financial
assistance is expended), the recipient or contractor will be recruiting individuals, and soliciting contractors,
for these economic opportunities. Section 3 requires that recipients not only include low- and very low-income persons
in these recruitment and solicitation efforts, but that, in fact, extra or greater efforts be undertaken to make these
persons aware of the existence of the economic opportunities, encourage their application for these opportunities,
and facilitate the employment of, or award of contracts to, these persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, the section 3 covered assistance is awarded and the recipient has no need for additional employees or
trainees, or the recipient has no need to contract for work, then the section 3 preference requirements are not triggered
because the recipient is not recruiting any individuals for jobs, or soliciting any business concerns for contracts.
Again, the section 3 preference requirements are triggered by the need for new hires (whether individual employees
or contractors or subcontractors) for work on a project or activity assisted by HUD financial assistance covered
by section 3.

V. Overview of the Interim Rule and Discussion of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the preamble provides a summary of the significant changes made to the October 8, 1993 proposed rule
by this interim rule in response to public comment, and discusses the public comments that prompted these changes.
This section also discusses those provisions of the proposed rule for which substantial comments were received requesting
change, and for which the Department declined to adopt the recommended change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Simplification of Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the rule was unnecessarily lengthy and complex, and contained sections and subparts
that seemed simply to duplicate the same information. Other commenters stated that one of the reasons for the complexity
of the rule was that uniform standards were not applied to all recipients and contractors. The commenters stated that,
under the October 8, 1993 proposed rule, the standards imposed on recipients and contractors depended upon the program
source of HUD funds received. These commenters stated that the distinction of effort required to be undertaken by
recipients on the basis of the source of the HUD financial assistance was inappropriate, and that all HUD recipients
and contractors should be required, as the statute mandates, to provide, to the greatest extent feasible, economic
opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. Other commenters stated that the rule was lengthened by the long
list of examples of efforts that recipients may, but were not required to, undertake to comply with the section 3 preference
requirements. The commenters stated that the rule should provide for the minimum requirements that recipients and
contractors must meet, and that options, suggestions, and recommendations should be provided in a notice, handbook,
or other form of guidance, but not in the rule. The Department agrees with all of the above commenters, and has made changes
to the proposed section 3 regulations in response to these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Consolidation of Rule Sections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has eliminated the separate subparts for implementing section 3 in public and Indian housing programs,
housing programs, and community development programs. The Department agrees with the commenters that much of the
information in these three subparts was duplicative. The interim rule provides one subpart that addresses the implementation
of section 3 in all covered programs, and this subpart makes distinctions for individual program features or requirements
where such distinctions are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Application of One ``Effort'' Standard to All Recipients and Contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule requires the same level of effort to be undertaken by all recipients and contractors, regardless
of the source of HUD financial assistance, to comply with the section 3 preference requirements. That level of effort
is one consistent with the statute's ``to the greatest extent feasible'' requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction in effort in the proposed rule imposed on public and Indian housing recipients on the one hand, and
recipients of funds from ``other'' programs (i.e., housing and community development programs) on the other hand,
was based on statutory terminology. The Congress used two different terms in describing the level of effort to be undertaken
in each of these two broad categories of HUD programs. The Congress used the term ``best efforts'' in connection with
the efforts required of public and Indian housing authorities, and ``greatest extent feasible'' in connection with
the efforts required of recipients of ``other program'' assistance. The different use of terms raised a presumption
that the terms have different meanings. However, on further consideration, the Department recognizes that there
is very little difference in the common meaning of these terms. Additionally, the Department determined that the
statute contemplates that every recipient and contractor that generates economic opportunities from the expenditure
of section 3 covered assistance, regardless of the HUD program from which the assistance is derived, must provide
these economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons to the greatest extent feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of Examples of ``Best Efforts'' and ``Good Faith Efforts''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the list of efforts in each of the three subparts in the proposed rule were examples of efforts that could be
undertaken by a recipient or contractor to comply with section 3, and not efforts required to be undertaken, the Department
has removed these efforts from the interim rule. The Department agrees that the inclusion of these efforts added to
the length of the interim rule and gave the appearance that the regulations are more cumbersome than they are. The list
of efforts has been moved to an appendix that accompanies the interim rule, and therefore remain an available source
of guidance to those recipients and contractors that found the list of efforts helpful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters provided examples of additional activities that may be helpful in soliciting the participation
of low- and very low-income persons in the job application and procurement processes, and these activities have been
included in the appendix to part 135. A few commenters stated that as certain efforts or activities undertaken by recipients,
and not currently included in the list of examples, prove to be successful, the Department should add the activity
or activities to the list of examples. The Department will amend the appendix from time to time to include additional
activities, or publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or in an industry trade periodical to advise of activities that a recipient or recipients have determined to be successful
in encouraging and facilitating the participation of low- and very low-income persons in the job application or procurement
process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of Procurement Procedures Required of Housing Authorities (HAs)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to removal of the list of efforts that may be undertaken by recipients and contractors, the interim rule
removes the provision in the proposed rule concerning procurement procedures that HAs were 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to follow in implementing the section 3 contracting preference for each of the competitive procurement methods authorized
in 24 CFR 85.36(d). As will be discussed in more detail later in this preamble, the Department has moved from a ``process''
oriented rule to a ``results'' oriented rule. That is, the Department is more concerned with the results of a recipient's
efforts to comply with the section 3 preference requirements than with each specific effort undertaken to achieve
those results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procurement procedures set forth in the proposed rule are included in the appendix to the interim rule, and thus
remain an option that HAs may use if they find these procedures helpful. Because of the removal of the required procurement
procedures from the rule, the concerns and issues raised by several housing authority commenters about negotiation
of best efforts before the award of a contract, and other issues that were specific to the procurement procedures set
forth in the proposed rule are no longer relevant, and need not be addressed. However, the Department emphasizes that
the removal of the procurement procedures from the text of the rule does not relieve recipients and contractors (regardless
of the type of section 3 covered assistance involved, i.e., public or Indian housing assistance, community development
assistance, etc.) of the responsibility to ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, the procurement practices
selected to award contracts provide for preference for section 3 business concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Retention of Tiers of Low-Income Persons and Business Concerns To Which Preference Is To Be Given
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters stated that the multi-tier preference categories for residents and business concerns create an
overly complex system, and should be removed from the rule. The multi-tier preference categories are established
by statute, and the regulation reflects the statutory requirement to provide preference for low-income persons
and business concerns in the order set forth in the statute. In recruiting low- and very low-income persons, the Congress
was very clear that in directing economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons, recipients are to target
first those low- and very low-income persons residing in public housing developments (when public and Indian housing
assistance is involved) or those residing closest to the project (in the service area or neighborhood) for which the
section 3 covered assistance is expended (when housing assistance and community development assistance are involved).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to commenters requesting removal of the tiers of preference categories were commenters that sought to
increase the numbers of preference categories. With respect to the preference categories for individuals, two commenters
suggested dividing the tiers to provide preference first to very low-income persons in each of the categories provided
by statute, followed by low-income persons. Other commenters suggested including preferences for welfare recipients,
JTPA graduates, and women and minorities who are low- and very low-income persons before other low- and very low-income
persons. With respect to the preference categories for business concerns, the commenters suggested providing preference
for resident-owned businesses owned by women or minorities, or providing preference for resident-owned businesses
outside the metropolitan area or non-metropolitan county before opening up competition to all businesses, when
there are no eligible resident-owned businesses within the metropolitan area or non-metropolitan county. The statute
provides no authority for the Department to adopt additional preference categories.

Results Oriented Rule: The Establishment of Numerical Goals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule provides for numerical hiring and contracting goals to demonstrate compliance with section 3. As
discussed in this section, the numerical standards constitute a ``safe harbor'' for compliance with section 3 and
are not absolute numerical requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department acknowledges that in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department specifically declined to adopt
numerical goals despite suggestions from members of the public to the contrary. The suggestions to adopt numerical
goals were made at meetings held at HUD Headquarters before publication of the proposed rule. As part of development
of the proposed rule, the Department held two meetings on section 3 at HUD Headquarters, and invited to these meetings
various housing authorities, industry groups, representatives of public housing residents and other low-income
residents. (These meetings and the listing of some of the individuals and groups that attended these meetings were
discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule at 58 FR 52535&hyph;52536.) At these meetings, several of the meeting
participants suggested, as did commenters on the proposed rule, that the section 3 rule provide for numerical goals
as goals that recipients and contractors should strive to meet, and as a means of measuring compliance with section
3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, the Department declined to adopt numerical goals stating that the establishment of numerical
goals was not consistent with the objectives of section 3. The Department stated:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3 provides that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws
and regulations, economic opportunities generated by the expenditure of HUD financial assistance should be given
to low- and very low-income persons. This means that, if feasible and if consistent with existing Federal, State and
local laws and regulations, all economic opportunities generated by HUD financial assistance must be given to low-
and very low-income persons. Generally, however, this will not be feasible in every case. For example, with respect
to employment opportunities, it is unlikely that in every hiring situation low- and very low-income persons will
be qualified for every job opportunity generated from the expenditure of HUD financial assistance. Therefore, it
is not possible to measure compliance with section 3 in terms of a numerical result, because numerical results will
vary dependent upon the circumstances of the hiring, e.g., the types of jobs offered, the skills required for these
jobs, and the qualifications of the low- and very low-income persons (residing within the metropolitan area, or non-metropolitan
county) to fill these jobs. Although every job may not be filled by a low-or a very low-income person, section 3 requires
that efforts must be made to hire as many low- and very low-income persons to the greatest extent feasible. (58 FR 52536)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Department continues to recognize that numerical results will vary depending upon the circumstances surrounding
the hiring or contract award, the Department was persuaded by comments on the proposed rule that broadly established
numerical ``goals'' (i.e., hiring or contracting levels likely to be achieved in most employment and contracting
situations) better serve the objectives of section 3, and better assist recipients and contractors in complying
with section 3, than a listing of various types of outreach efforts that recipients and contractors may undertake.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters on the proposed rule expressed concern about the number of low- and very low-income persons hired,
and the numbers of contracts awarded to section 3 business concerns that would be considered by the Department to be
in compliance with section 3. The commenters stated that the proposed rule required recipients to report annually
on the numbers of training and employment opportunities provided to low- and very low-income persons, and the number
of contracting opportunities awarded to section 3 business concerns, but failed to provide any indication about
what hiring and contracting results would be considered in compliance with section 3. A few commenters stated that
a focus on efforts, and not results, would make recipients overly concerned with the process, and not with the outcome
of the process; that is, recipients would be too concerned whether efforts undertaken matched those in the regulation,
without serious analysis of whether those efforts were appropriate for achieving the desired results. In a similar
vein, a few commenters stated that the Department's role was to focus on the results, and the role of the recipients
and contractors is to determine how best to achieve those results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, &sect;135.30 of the interim rule establishes numerical goals (stated in terms of percentages)
for training and employment, and for contracting. The Department will not repeat in the preamble, the entire text
of this section, but will note some key features of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goals in &sect;135.30 apply to the entire amount of the section 3 covered assistance awarded to a recipient in any
Federal Fiscal Year commencing with the first Federal Fiscal Year (FY) following the effective date of this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goals in &sect;135.30 apply to ``new hires'' (i.e., that is person in new employment opportunities generated
from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance). The interim rule defines ``new hires'' to mean full-time positions
that are permanent, temporary or seasonal. The interim rule makes clear that the employment opportunities with which
the numerical goal concept is concerned are those full-time positions generated from the expenditure of section
3 covered assistance. The Department recognizes that the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance may generate
part-time employment opportunities, either of a permanent, temporary or seasonal nature, and these opportunities
are addressed in &sect;135.40, entitled ``Providing Other Economic Opportunities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 135.30 provides for the goals to increase in percentage over a period of three years. For example, for FY 1995,
recipients of section 3 covered public and Indian housing assistance must commit to employ low- and very low-income
persons as 10 percent of the aggregate number of new hires they make. This percentage increases to 20 percent in FY 1996,
and to 30 percent in FY 1997 and thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 135.30 also provides that a recipient that meets the minimum numerical goals set forth in this section will
be considered to have complied with the section 3 preference requirements, absent evidence to the contrary. The following
provides an example of how a recipient may meet the minimum numerical goals, but found not to be in compliance with the
section 3 preference requirements. A recipient meets the 10 percent minimum goals by employing section 3 residents
in new entry level positions that the recipient has available in connection with work on a section 3 covered project.
However, the recipient made no effort to employ, and does not employ, section 3 residents in more skilled positions
that the recipient also had available. That is, the recipient made no effort to make section 3 residents aware that
these positions were available, or to encourage section 3 residents to apply for these positions. Again, section
3 requires that, to the greatest extent feasible, recipients and contractors will give 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 employment opportunities generated from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance to section 3 residents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The efforts to employ section 3 residents applies to all new employment opportunities, at all levels. The efforts
to award contracts to section 3 business concerns applies to all contracts to be awarded. In the example provided above,
if the recipient that met the 10 percent numerical goal, strived, to the greatest extent feasible, to provide all available
employment opportunities to section 3 residents, and if the skills, previous work experience, or education of the
those residents who applied for the jobs only met the qualifications for entry-level positions, then there is no evidence
contradicting that the recipient is in compliance with section 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 135.30 also provides that in evaluating compliance with section 3 as provided in subpart D (which addresses
both the Department's compliance reviews, and complaints filed by section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns),
a recipient that has not met the numerical goals has the burden of demonstrating why it was not feasible to meet the goals.
Such justification would include not only a description of actions taken to hire or contract with low- and very low-income
persons, but also impediments encountered despite efforts undertaken. In demonstrating why it was not feasible
to meet the numerical goals, a recipient or contractor also can indicate other economic opportunities provided to
section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns, as addressed in &sect;135.40 (other economic opportunities
provided to residents and business concerns in an effort to comply with section 3 and the requirements of this part).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of numerical goals, and the removal of the various types of best effort and good faith effort activities
from the rule, respond to commenters' concerns about little flexibility in implementation of section 3, and the uncertainty
about what constitutes compliance with section 3. The interim rule increases flexibility by allowing recipients
and contractors to determine the procedures, efforts and activities that work for them in meeting the section 3 preference
requirements. The interim rule reduces uncertainty about what constitutes compliance with section 3 by providing
recipients and contractors with safe harbor levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the numerical goals in the interim rule are exactly that_``goals'' that recipients
and contractors should strive to reach. The goals are not to be construed as requirements, quotas, set-asides or a
cap on hiring or contracting with low- and very low-income persons (e.g., recipients and contractors are not to set
aside or reserve ten percent of available jobs for low- and very low-income persons). Consistent with the greatest
extent feasible requirement, the Department hopes that recipients and contractors will exceed these goals. The
goals, if met, constitute a safe harbor for recipients and contractors on the issue of compliance with section 3 (absent
evidence to the contrary, as discussed above). The goals, if not met, do not automatically trigger sanctions against
the recipient or contractor. However, if challenged on the issue of compliance with section 3, the recipient or contractor
should be ready to demonstrate that it strived, but was unable, to reach the safe harbor levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of numerical goals is the principal reason that the Department is issuing this rule as an interim
rule. The Department believes that the low percentage goals that are targets to be met for FY 1995 are achievable by
the majority of recipients that will undertake hiring or contracting as a result of the expenditure of section 3 covered
assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final section 3 rule, which will be based on additional public comment, will be issued before the goals for FY 1996
are applicable. The Department specifically requests comment from the public on the numerical goals set forth in
&sect;135.30.

In addition to promoting one ``effort'' standard that would be applicable to all recipients, several commenters
stated that the issue of thresholds also should be treated uniformly. The commenters stated that the thresholds should
be applied to all recipients and contractors, or none at all. Eight commenters stated that a threshold requirement
is inconsistent with the statute's ``greatest extent feasible'' requirement. Seven commenters stated that a dollar
threshold for housing authorities is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inconsistent with a greatest extent feasible requirement. Nine commenters representing units of local government
stated that the dollar threshold for recipients of housing and community development assistance was too low, and
should be raised. Other commenters stated that in lieu of a dollar threshold, the rule should establish a population
threshold so that small and rural communities which sustain few businesses, and must advertise regionally (rather
than locally) to fill economic opportunities, would be exempt from compliance with section 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department carefully considered all comments on the issue of thresholds, and determined to retain the proposed
rule's position on this issue, which is to provide no dollar thresholds for HAs and their contractors and subcontractors,
and to provide dollar thresholds for recipients of housing or community development, and their contractors and subcontractors.

No Thresholds for HAs, and Their Contractors and Subcontractors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department continues to maintain that a dollar threshold in section 3 covered public and Indian housing programs
is not consistent with the statute. Section 3 applies to public and Indian housing operating assistance, development
assistance and modernization assistance, which covers virtually all HA projects and activities. Additionally,
the statute is very specific about the residents and business concerns to which HAs and their contractors and subcontractors
must give preference. These residents and business concerns are tied to the housing development for which the assistance
is expended, or another development owned by the HA. The Department believes that the statute's expansive coverage
of public and Indian housing projects and activities indicates that any attempt to diminish the coverage would be
inconsistent with the statute.

In contrast to public and Indian housing programs, section 3 coverage in housing and community development programs
is limited to housing and community development assistance expended for housing rehabilitation, housing construction
and other public construction. The Department continues to maintain that the limited section 3 coverage in housing
and community development programs makes thresholds in housing and community development programs acceptable,
and not inconsistent with the statute. Additionally, on further consideration, and as discussed below in the section
on ``HUD share,'' the Department has determined to raise the thresholds to twice the amount set forth in the proposed
rule.

Removal of HUD Share and Project Cost
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Related to the issue of thresholds is the concept of ``HUD share'' because, under the proposed rule, the threshold
was based on the HUD share of project cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters were divided on the issue of HUD share. Eight commenters stated that in determining whether the dollar
threshold is met, the entire project and total dollar amount should be considered, and not solely the HUD share of this
total dollar amount. These commenters stated that the use of HUD share creates excessive paperwork. Ten commenters
stated that using HUD share to determine the dollar threshold was correct. These commenters stated that to peg the
threshold to total development cost would not appropriately tie section 3 responsibility to Federal assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agreed with the commenters who stated that the use of HUD share and calculation of the project cost makes
the rule cumbersome, and creates additional paperwork. Accordingly, the interim rule provides for the threshold
to be based on the amount of the award of assistance_an amount by which responsibility to comply with the section 3 preference
requirements is more easily determined. Because the interim rule removes the HUD share and project cost calculations
for determining the threshold (a process which excluded certain costs of the recipient), the Department determined
that it is appropriate to raise the dollar thresholds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule provides that the requirements of part 135 apply to recipients of covered section 3 housing and community
development assistance for which the amount of the assistance exceeds $200,000; and these requirements apply to
contractors and subcontractors performing work on projects funded by housing and community development assistance
for which the recipient's award exceeds $200,000, and the contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. If the recipient's
award of assistance exceeds $200,000, but the contracts and subcontracts do not exceed $100,000, then only the recipient
is subject to the section 3 preference requirements. The recipient's responsibility includes awarding contracts,
to the greatest extent feasible, to section 3 business concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Congress amended section 3, it narrowed the type of activity to which the statute would apply in housing and
community development programs to three types of construction projects: housing rehabilitation (including reduction
and abatement of lead-based paint hazards); housing construction; and other public construction projects. A few
commenters stated that the proposed rule's implication that ``covered opportunities'' in housing and community
development programs were limited to construction-type jobs (e.g., heavy labor, trade jobs) was incorrect. The
commenters stated that the statute applies to employment and training opportunities ``arising in connection with''
these three types of construction projects, and that jobs arising in connection with these projects are not only the
construction jobs, but also, management, maintenance, clerical and administrative jobs that come into existence
because of the construction project.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters are correct that management, maintenance and administrative jobs created to undertake work in connection
with the construction or rehabilitation project are covered by section 3, and the interim rule clarifies this coverage.
However, management, maintenance or administrative jobs generated from the expenditure of housing assistance
(excluding public and Indian housing assistance) or community development assistance, but which assistance is
not expended for rehabilitation, construction, or other public construction (and thus is not section 3 covered assistance),
are not subject to the section 3 preference requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether employment opportunities generated from the expenditure of HUD financial assistance are subject
to the section 3 preference requirements, a determination must first be made if the HUD assistance is covered by section
3. As discussed previously, section 3 applies to the following public and Indian housing assistance: operating assistance,
development assistance, and modernization assistance. All employment opportunities generated by the expenditure
of this assistance are subject to the section 3 preference requirements. With respect to assistance other than public
and Indian housing assistance, section 3 applies to housing assistance and community development assistance expended
for housing rehabilitation (including reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards), housing construction
or other public construction project. Thus, the section 3 preference requirements only apply to employment opportunities
``arising in connection with'' housing rehabilitation, housing construction or other public construction project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, HUD housing assistance that is expended for project operations (i.e., assistance that is operating assistance,
but not operating assistance pursuant to section 9 of the 1937 Act) is not covered by section 3. Accordingly, a maintenance
supervisory position that becomes available as a result of the expenditure of this assistance is not subject to the
section 3 preference requirements. A maintenance supervisory position that becomes available as a result of work
in connection with housing rehabilitation is subject to the section 3 preference requirements.

Additionally, the interim rule provides a definition of ``other HUD programs'' to distinguish between HUD public
and Indian housing programs covered by section 3 and other HUD programs covered by section 3. The other HUD programs
covered by section 3 are those that provide housing or community development assistance for housing rehabilitation,
housing construction, or other public construction project.

Clarification That in Covered Housing and Community Development Programs, ``Housing Rehabilitation'' Does Not
Include Routine Maintenance and Repair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to clarifying the types of jobs that are covered by the statutory phrase ``arising in connection with,''
the interim rule also clarifies what constitutes ``housing rehabilitation.'' Routine maintenance and repair do
not constitute ``housing rehabilitation.'' The parenthetical statement in the statute which follows the term ``housing
rehabilitation'' provides that housing rehabilitation includes reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards.
This language indicates that something more than routine maintenance and repair or replacement is contemplated
by the term ``housing rehabilitation.'' As discussed in the preceding section, the Department notes that maintenance
and repair undertaken in connection with housing rehabilitation (e.g., clean-up after rehabilitation has been
performed) are covered by section 3.

Clarification of Range of Economic Opportunities That May Be Generated by Section 3 Covered Public and Indian Housing
Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters stated that the proposed rule placed a heavy emphasis on construction jobs, which may be appropriate
in the context of housing and community development assistance (given the limited section 3 coverage), but is inappropriate
in the context of section 3 covered public and Indian housing assistance. The commenters stated that, in public and
Indian housing programs, the statute covers opportunities generated by development assistance, modernization,
and operating assistance, and that all jobs generated from the expenditure of these major sources of funding for HAs
should be covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters are correct that all jobs, whether administrative, clerical, managerial, or construction related,
generated from the expenditure of operating assistance, development assistance or modernization assistance are
subject to the section 3 preference requirements and the interim rule makes this clarification.

A few commenters stated that the Department erred in its broad exclusion of section 8 assistance from section 3 coverage.
The commenters are correct with respect to section 8 project-based assistance. Although section 8 project-based
assistance currently does not often finance rehabilitation and construction projects, where section 8 project-based
assistance is expended for housing rehabilitation or construction, the assistance is covered by section 3.

Retention of Proposed Rule's Interpretation of ``Section 3 Covered Contract'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirteen commenters stated that the Department should interpret ``section 3 covered contracts'' to include contracts
for the purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment, where no installation is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Exclusion of Contracts for the Purchase of Materials and Supplies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department declines to adopt this interpretation. The Department believes that the phrase ``for work'' which
accompanies the term ``contract'' throughout the statute indicates that the requirements of section 3 were not intended
to apply to contractors who only furnish materials or supplies, and do not undertake work, as in the installation of
the material or equipment. The Department, however, encourages the purchase of materials and supplies from section
3 business concerns as a means of providing economic opportunities other than those connected with section 3 covered
assistance (see &sect;135.40).

Continuation of Extension of Section 3 Coverage to Private, For-Profit Businesses Receiving HUD Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Department defined ``section 3 covered project'' to clarify that ``other public construction
project'' included buildings or improvements, regardless of ownership, assisted with housing or community development
assistance. The Department specifically requested comment from the public on this proposal to extend section 3 coverage
though the definition of ``section 3 covered project'' to all private, for-profit entities that receive HUD housing
or community development assistance for a section 3 covered project, including private, for-profit businesses
receiving Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for economic development projects. Fifteen commenters
supported this proposal, stating that it was important that section 3 apply to private, for-profit entities receiving
HUD financial assistance. Six commenters opposed the proposal, stating that the Economic Development portion of
the CDBG program is already designed to hire low- and very low-income persons, and to extend section 3 coverage to economic
development projects is redundant and confusing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was not persuaded by the commenters in opposition to the proposal. Although the Economic Development
portion of the CDBG program supports the employment of low- and very low-income persons, the employment of these persons
is not triggered in the same manner as provided by section 3. For example, an economic development project may involve
the building of a widget factory. When construction of the factory is complete, there is a commitment to employ a certain
percentage of low- and very low-income persons as factory workers. However, there is no requirement for the developer
or builder of the factory to employ low- or very low-income persons in the construction of the factory. Section 3 would
cover the job opportunities created at this stage of the economic development project.

to refer to both low- and very low-income persons would result in oversight of the need to direct recruitment and solicitation
efforts to very low-income persons. Instead of selecting one of the statutory terms to refer to both income groups,
the interim rule uses the term ``section 3 residents'' to refer to both low- and very low-income residents.

Clarification That ``Section 3 Resident'' Includes Public Housing Residents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters stated that some public housing residents do not meet the low-income or very low-income qualifications
established by section 3, but noted that the statute indicates that all public housing residents are eligible for
the priority consideration established by section 3 for public housing resident in employment and training opportunities.
The commenters requested that the Department resolve this contradiction by explicitly including public housing
residents in the definition of ``section 3 resident.'' The Department agrees with the commenters that the definition
of ``section 3 resident'' should include all public housing residents. Section 915 of the 1992 Act (the section that
amended section 3), provides that it is ``the policy of the Congress and the purpose of section 3'' that economic opportunities
generated by HUD financial assistance be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, ``particularly [to]
those who are recipients of government assistance for housing.'' The inclusion of ``public housing resident'' in
the definition of ``section 3 resident'' is consistent with Congressional policy and statutory intent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions of Low-Income and Very Low-Income Are Statutory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested alternative definitions for low-income person and very low-income person. The commenters
wanted the definitions to specifically include participants in programs under the Job Training Partnership Act
(JTPA), welfare recipients, and welfare eligible applicants, or to base the income level on household income, not
individual income, or to base the income level on a percentage of the median of the majority income, and not an all inclusive
median income. Section 915 of the 1992 Act, which amended section 3, specifically provides that ``low-income person''
and ``very low-income person'' shall have the meanings provided these terms in section 3(b)(2) of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937 (1937 Act). Accordingly, the definitions are taken from this section of the 1937 Act.

Proof of Status as Section 3 Resident Is the Responsibility of the Individual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters raised questions concerning the form of certification or other evidence they were required to obtain
or accept from individuals to verify their status as a section 3 resident. A few other commenters stated that questions
about a person's income were an invasion of privacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule does not mandate (nor did the proposed rule) that the recipient, contractor or subcontractor require
certification or evidence of a person's section 3 status. However, if verification of status is requested, it is the
responsibility of the individual seeking the preference in employment provided by section 3, to present evidence
that the person is a low-income or very low-income person. The Department does not prescribe any special form of certification.
Acceptable documentation or evidence may include evidence of a person's residency in a public housing development,
or evidence of section 8 certificate or voucher assistance, or other evidence of participation in a HUD or other Federally
assisted program such as JTPA, AFDC, or JOBS, or evidence of participation in a State or local assistance program,
or receipt of welfare assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the subject of invasion of privacy, one commenter stated that an individual who applies for a job should not have
to disclose his or her income. If an individual wants to take advantage of the preference provided by section 3, the
individual must be willing to make such disclosure, or as noted earlier, present other evidence of participation
in a program that assists low- or very low-income persons. It is not unusual for programs that provide preference for
certain groups (e.g., elderly persons, young persons of a certain age group, minorities) to require the persons claiming
the preference to support eligibility for the preference.

Revision to the Definition of ``Section 3 Business Concern'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested alternative definitions for ``section 3 business concern.'' The proposed rule defined
a section 3 business concern three different ways. To be eligible for the section 3 preference, a business concern
would only have to meet one of the three definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Definition Is Unchanged. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters criticized the first definition, which requires 51 percent or more ownership of the business by low-
or very low-income persons. The commenters stated that this definition was totally unrealistic. The commenters
stated that if a business concern is sufficiently capitalized to bid on construction projects of substantial size
and complexity, then in all likelihood the owners were not low-income or very low-income persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first definition is derived from the statute which calls for majority ownership by low-income or very low-income
persons. The Department acknowledges that there is a small percentage of these types of business concerns. These
business concerns exist primarily in public housing developments, and therefore are business concerns to which
housing authorities have access for contract work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several public housing developments across the nation, residents have organized to form small businesses that
are engaged in lawn care, building maintenance, and even small manufacturing work, and provide these services for
the development in which they reside or for other developments owned by the housing authority. The commenters are
correct that generally resident-owned businesses are not the business concerns that are capable of bidding and performing
work as the primary contractor for a major construction or rehabilitation project. Nevertheless, because this definition
is statutory, and has meaning within the public housing industry, the first definition is retained by the interim
rule, and remains unchanged from the definition in the proposed rule.

Some Revision to Second Definition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second definition in the proposed rule, which is also derived from the statute, provided that a section 3 business
concern also includes a business concern that employs a substantial number of section 3 residents for the type of activity
in which the business concern is engaged. Commenters stated that this definition was more realistic than the first
definition, but requested that the rule provide more guidance about the meaning of ``substantial.'' Several commenters
suggested that this term be quantified, and submitted suggestions ranging from 20 percent to 75 percent of the employees
of the business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, the second definition has been revised in the interim rule to mean a ``business concern
whose permanent, full-time employees consist of persons, at least 30 percent of whom are section 3 residents'' (or
who were section 3 residents at the time of their initial employment.) The Department believes that the 30 percent
figure represents a reasonable interpretation of ``substantial'' in this context. A figure of 30 percent is not so
high as to significantly limit the number of business concerns that could meet this standard, nor so low as to make the
preference for a business concern that employs a substantial number of low- or very low-income persons to be irrelevant.

low-income or very low-income persons, this second definition of ``section 3 business concern'' provides for this
credit. This second definition of section 3 business concern provides that in determining which business concerns
meet this second definition, consideration is give to business concerns that employ a substantial number (30 percent)
of low or very low-income persons who were low- or very low-income persons at the time the persons were employed by the
business, but whose incomes now exceed the income level of a low- or very low-income person, and the date of first employment
by the business concern has not exceeded a period of three years. The Department wants to give preference to business
concerns who employed low- and very low-income persons, and provided for their advancement from that income level.

New Third Definition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the third definition for ``section 3 business concern'' referred to a business concern that
is substantially owned, but less than 51 percent owned, by low-income persons or very low-income persons and employs
these persons in key management positions. This definition was soundly criticized by a number of commenters as being
unrealistic, and promoting fraud and abuse by allowing less than 51 percent ownership by low- and very low-income
persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public comment, this definition has been removed in the interim rule and replaced with the following:
``a business concern that provides evidence of a commitment to subcontract, in excess of 25 percent of the dollar amount
of all subcontracts to be awarded, to business concerns that meet either the first or second definition of section
3 business concern.'' Through this definition, a preference in contracting will be provided to business concerns
that are neither owned by low- or very low-income persons, nor employ (as their own employees) a substantial number
(30 percent) of low- or very low-income persons, but that actively seek and award subcontracts to businesses owned
by low- or very low-income persons, or businesses that substantially employ low- and very low-income persons. The
purpose of this definition is to provide a preference to primary contractors that have a successful record of subcontracting
with section 3 business concerns.

Proof of Status as Section 3 Business Concern Is the Responsibility of the Business Concern. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters raised questions about verifying the status of a section 3 business concern. Again, verification
or certification is not mandated by this interim rule. If requested, it is the responsibility of the business concern
that wants to take advantage of the preference provided by section 3 to produce acceptable support or documentation
that it qualifies as a section 3 business concern.

Revision to NOFA and Bonus Points Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received many comments on the proposal in the October 8, 1993 rule to provide in a notice of funding availability
(NOFA) for the award of bonus points to applicants who have past experience and achievements in providing economic
opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters stated that the award of bonus points for applicants who have successfully complied with section
3 was a good idea, but that the rule should place a limit on the number of points to be awarded to avoid abuse. Other commenters
stated that bonus points should be awarded for past performance only if the applicant's current proposal, submitted
in response to the NOFA, demonstrates a commitment to undertake section 3 efforts consistent with past performance.
Two commenters stated that bonus points should be awarded on the basis of efforts made, and not results achieved, because
many recipients make good faith efforts without achieving significant results. Three commenters stated that the
proposal favored large housing authorities (over small housing authorities) that have active resident management
corporations and resident councils. The commenters stated that as a result of these active resident groups, large
housing authorities would more often be eligible for the bonus points and edge out small housing authorities for awards
made under a NOFA. Six commenters stated that the bonus points proposal was inappropriate, and should be removed because
it is unrelated to funding need, and further stated that it would be difficult for the Department to verify ``claimed''
past success under section 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Department revised this regulatory section. Section 135.9 of the interim rule,
which addresses this issue, provides the following. First, for competitively awarded assistance in which the grants
are for activities administered by an HA, and those activities as described in the NOFA are anticipated by the Department
to generate significant training, employment or contracting opportunities, the NOFA must include a statement that
one of the purposes of the assistance is to give, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal,
State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting, and other economic opportunities
generated from the expenditure of this assistance to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns. Second,
this same statement must be included in NOFAs for competitively awarded assistance involving housing rehabilitation,
housing construction, or other public construction, where the amount of the award to the applicant is anticipated
to exceed $200,000. Third, this section provides that in the evaluation of applications for the award of assistance
under the NOFAs discussed above, consideration will be given to the extent to which the applicant demonstrates that
it will train and employ section 3 residents and contract with section 3 business concerns for economic opportunities
generated in connection with the project/activity assisted. The evaluation criteria to be utilized and the rating
points to be assigned will be specified in the NOFA.

Absence of Listing of Existing Federal, State, and Local Laws and Regulations That Are Inconsistent or in Conflict
With Section 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised questions about the statutory requirement that implementation of section 3 (i.e., compliance
with the preference requirements) must be consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations
that are inconsistent with section 3. A few of the commenters requested that the rule provide a list of all existing
laws and regulations that are inconsistent with section 3. Other commenters stated that the rule should expressly
provide for the preemption of other laws that are inconsistent with section 3. Another commenter asked that the rule
clarify who will make the determination of whether there is a conflict between section 3 and an existing Federal, State
or local law. As discussed in this section, the Department does not agree that there is a need for a list of other laws
and regulations inconsistent with section 3, or that there is a need to expressly preempt inconsistent laws.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Laws that Provide Preference. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The section 3 preference in hiring for low- and very low-income persons, and in contracting for businesses owned by
these persons was not created by the 1992 Act. Section 3, when originally enacted in 1968, provided for this preference.
The 1992 Act amends section 3 to require that in providing preference to low and very low-income persons, recipients,
contractors, and subcontractors must first target for job opportunities smaller groups within the broad category
of low-income persons, such as public housing residents. Since its enactment in 1968, the Department is not aware,
or has not been made aware of any existing Federal, State, or local law or regulation that is expressly in conflict with
the section 3 preference requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule of statutory construction is to interpret statutes to give meaning to all and to avoid conflicts. For example,
section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act provides a preference for training
and employment opportunities and contracting for Native Americans. Where both the preference for Native Americans
and the section 3 preference for local residents cannot be met, the preference for Native Americans takes priority.
However, it is possible that the two preferences can work together so that the intent of both statutes is met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consideration given to utilization of women's business enterprises (WBEs) and minority business enterprises
(MBEs) in HUD programs is also not necessarily at odds with the section 3 preference, as believed by some commenters.
The preference required by section 3 is neither gender specific nor race, nor ethnic origin specific. The preference
required by section 3 is one of income (to be eligible for the preference, the person's income may not exceed a certain
level) and one of location (the preference is for low-income and very low-income persons residing in proximity to
the project or activity where the HUD financial assistance is being expended). This is a very broad preference category,
and can encompass preferences promoted by other statutes and regulations, such as preferences for WBEs, MBEs, and
other socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (i.e., business for which are 51 percent or more owned
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals). The Department anticipates that section 3 and similar
preference laws will serve to support, rather than obstruct, the preferences specified by each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the issue of preemption, generally, Federal law may preempt the enforcement of a State or local law if: (1) The Federal
statute expressly preempts State or local law; (2) the Federal statute does not contain an express preemption provision,
but it is clear that the Congress intended to preempt by occupying an entire field of regulation, and has thereby left
no room for the State to supplement Federal law; or (3) compliance with both Federal and State law is impossible, or
State law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the Congress.
Under the third test, Federal preemption must reflect a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were
committed to the agency's care by statute. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 699 (1984)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first two tests do not apply because section 3 contains no express preemption provision, and there is no clear indication
of Congressional intent to preempt. In fact, the statute specifically provides that a recipient's efforts to employ
section 3 residents and award contracts to section 3 business concerns shall be ``consistent with existing Federal,
State, and local laws and regulations.'' Therefore, any claim of Federal preemption would have to be based on the third
test, and the Department would have to determine that compliance with both section 3 and State or local law is impossible,
or that State or local law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives
of section 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of the phrase ``consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations'' indicates
that the Congress did not envision that State or local law would make compliance with Section 3 impossible or that State
or local law would be an obstacle to compliance with section 3. Again, as discussed earlier in this preamble, the preference
provided by section 3 is sufficiently broad that there should be little conflict with State or local laws. However,
the section 3 preference requirements would prevail over a permissive (not mandatory) State or local law provision
that has the potential to conflict with section 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determining if There Is a Conflict in Laws. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of conflict between part 135 and an existing Federal, State, or local law would only arise if a recipient or
contractor failed to comply with the requirements of part 135, and asserted the position that the failure was based
upon conflicting Federal, State, or local law. The Department would consider the recipient's assertion of conflicting
laws (e.g., a local legal opinion) when the Department determined that the recipient or contractor failed to meet
the requirements of part 135 and that there was a reasonable basis for the Department to take sanctions based on that
failure. (The Department notes that some program statutes or regulations (e.g., the Community Development Block
Grant and HOME Investment Partnership programs) may require notice and opportunity for a hearing before an administrative
law judge before sanctions are imposed. Accordingly, the Department would have to convince the administrative law
judge of the Department's determination regarding failure to comply with section 3, including the Department's
determination regarding the conflict of other law with part 135.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the subject of the relationship of section 3 to other related laws, the interim rule contains a new section (&sect;135.11)
that references other laws that are applicable to job training, employment, and contracting. These laws include
program statutes that require payment of prevailing wages determined under the Davis-Bacon Act or (in the case of
public and Indian housing) determined by HUD to be prevailing. These laws also include reference to Executive Order
11246 (which requires affirmative action to ensure that employees or applicants are treated without regard to their
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin), and regulations governing approved apprenticeship programs.
This section also references the procurement procedures of 24 CFR 85.36.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters raised questions about the relationship of the procurement procedures of 24 CFR 85.36 to section
3. The requirements in &sect;85.36 are not inconsistent with part 135. Rather provisions in &sect;85.36 can facilitate
actions by the recipients to meet part 135. For example, &sect;85.36(c)(2) expressly prohibits the use of local geographic
preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in the cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly
mandate or encourage geographic preference. Section 3 is such a statute encouraging geographic preference. Additionally,
the Department notes that neither the section 3 statute nor the part 135 interim rule supersedes the general requirement
of 24 CFR 85.36(c) that all procurement transactions be conducted in a competitive manner.

Reduced Monitoring Responsibilities of Recipients

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several housing authority commenters objected to the requirement in the rule that they must monitor the operations
of their contractors and subcontractors to ensure compliance with section 3. They stated that this requirement imposes
a significant administrative burden on recipients, and the rule provided no guidance on how recipients should undertake
this monitoring function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule removes the provision in the proposed rule that required recipients to ``monitor'' the operations
of their contractors and subcontractors to ensure compliance with section 3. While the interim rule continues to
require that recipients ``ensure'' that their contractors and subcontractors comply with section 3, the rule (see
&sect;135.32) clarifies that this responsibility to ``ensure compliance'' means that a recipient: (1) Should refrain
from contracting with contractors for which the recipient has received notice or has knowledge that the contractor
has been found in violation of the regulations in part 135; (2) should respond to complaints made to the recipient by
section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns that a contractor or subcontractor is not in compliance with the
part 135 regulations; and (3) must cooperate with the Department in obtaining the compliance of contractors and subcontractors
when allegations are made and supported that the recipient's contractors and subcontractors are not in compliance
with the regulations of part 135.

Revisions to Enforcement Section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters criticized the enforcement provisions in the proposed rule. The commenters either found the
enforcement provisions too weak, or too severe for a statute that requires recipients, contractors, and subcontractors
to make a good faith effort to employ section 3 residents, and contract with section 3 business concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the interim rule provides for an enforcement process that promotes compliance with
section 3, provides relief to complainants where appropriate, encourages resolution at the lowest possible level
(i.e., resolutions among the parties involved in the complaint), strives for an informal resolution whenever possible,
and when necessary, provides for the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to impose a resolution
on the parties involved, which resolution will be effective unless it is appealed within 15 days of notice of the imposed
resolution. The interim rule continues to provide for the referral of the complaint for resolution under the procedures
and sanctions provided in the regulations governing the section 3 covered assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of the commenters complained that the proposed rule was unduly burdensome with respect to recordkeeping
requirements. As discussed in this section, the interim rule substantially reduces those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For HAs, the interim rule removes the regulatory provision that required HAs to undertake specific procurement procedures
which required the recipient to negotiate and agree upon, and to document the ``best efforts'' to be undertaken by
a contractor before the award of the contract to the contractor. For HAs, the interim rule removes the requirement
to amend HA personnel policies to include a statement that the HA's personnel practices provide preference for low-
and very low-income persons in training and employment opportunities. For all recipients, the interim rule removes
the requirement to amend any written procurement policies to include a statement that the recipient's procurement
practices provide preference for section 3 business concerns. For all recipients, the interim rule also removes
the requirement to document the mechanism by which the recipient ensured that its contractors and subcontractors
complied with the section 3 preference requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the information that the Department does require is largely information that the recipient, contractor,
or subcontractor already maintains. Recipients, contractors, and subcontractors engaged in hiring, or in contracting
are already required by other statutes and regulations to maintain information on the number of new hires, the names
and addresses of these employees, the race, ethnic origin and gender of the employees, and the positions for which
they were employed, and the salary provided. For contracts, the number of contracts awarded, the party to whom the
contract was awarded, the nature of the contract and dollar value are data recorded by the recipient or contractor.
The additional information that this interim rule requires is the income level of the employees hired (this information
is needed to determine if they are section 3 residents) and the status of the business concern as a section 3 business
concern. The income level of the employees is information that the Department must have to fulfill its responsibilities
under section 3. The statute requires the Secretary of HUD to ensure that economic opportunities are being directed
to low- and very low-income persons.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters asked why section 3 is administered by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The commenters
stated that since section 3 is actually implemented in public and Indian housing, and housing, and community development
programs, it should be administered by the offices for these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary has delegated the functions and responsibilities of the Secretary under section 3 to the Assistant
Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO). The delegation of authority to the Assistant Secretary
for FHEO dates back to the issuance of the first regulations for part 135 in 1973. One of the reasons for delegating responsibility
to the Assistant Secretary for FHEO is that, nationally, a disproportionate number of low- and very low-income persons
residing in family public housing developments, and in neighborhoods receiving housing and community development
assistance, are racial and ethnic minorities, a group that has been subject to discrimination in employment, housing,
financing and other areas. Since section 3 specifically pertains to matters of employment (whether individual hiring
or through the award of contracts) FHEO is the office with expertise in addressing matters of discrimination in employment.
This expertise will be beneficial in addressing complaints of recipient or contractor noncompliance with section
3.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department acknowledges that compliance with section 3 is not without cost or burden to recipients and contractors,
but that burden, in large part, is imposed by statute. The statute requires recipients, their contractors, and subcontractors,
to provide, to the greatest extent feasible, economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. To meet
this statutory requirement, recipients, contractors, and subcontractors must undertake certain actions and efforts
to make low- and very low-income persons aware of economic opportunities generated from the expenditure of HUD financial
assistance, and to encourage their application for these opportunities. The statute requires the Secretary of HUD
to ensure that economic opportunities generated from the expenditure of HUD financial assistance are being directed,
to the greatest extent feasible, to low- and very low-income persons. To meet this statutory requirement, the Secretary
of HUD must solicit certain information from recipients to ensure that they are undertaking the actions and efforts
required by statute. The Department, however, has made every effort to minimize the burden on recipients and contractors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments on the proposed rule, staff from the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity invited various
groups representative of recipients, contractors, and residents for an informal meeting held at HUD Headquarters
on February 23, 1994, to discuss the monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements proposed to be imposed
on recipients by the October 8, 1993 rule. (A summary of the meeting's discussion, and a list of the attendees at the
meeting is part of the docket file for this rule.) Following consideration of comments at this meeting, in addition
to comments received on the proposed rule, the Department has revised the rule. The interim rule reduces, to the greatest
extent possible, the administrative burden on recipients from that set forth in the October 8, 1993 proposed rule.
The ways in which the administrative burden has been reduced were discussed in Section V of the preamble.

 The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) has announced a 30-site technical assistance initiative
beginning in FY 1995 to help recipients understand their section 3 responsibilities and to help them design and implement
effective programs and procedures to make training, employment and contracts available to section 3 residents.
FHEO is planning to provide further guidance through participation in conferences with associations representing
recipients and contractors. With support from the private sector, FHEO is developing detailed guidance material
that will assist recipients and residents with understanding section 3, and the responsibilities imposed on recipients.
Additionally, the FY 1995 legislative proposal would make expenses associated with implementation of section 3
eligible costs under section 3 covered programs. Further, the FY 1995 Budget includes a request for funding to establish
``economic opportunity centers'' that will link low-income persons with jobs and contracts generated by HUD-assisted
projects and activities. These centers will provide technical and financial assistance to qualified residents,
as well as assistance to HUD recipients in recruiting, training and hiring of low-income persons.

 As stated in Section V of this preamble, section 3 does not require recipients or contractors to create training programs
for low- and very low-income persons, or to create or provide any other services to low- and very low-income persons
solely for the sake of providing opportunity programs for low- or very low-income persons. Section 3 requires that
where section 3 covered assistance will generate economic opportunities (i.e., not out of necessity to serve low-
or very low-income persons, but out of necessity to serve the employment or contracting needs of the recipient or contractor),
these opportunities must be directed to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.

 Several commenters offered suggestions on implementation of section 3, including establishing section 3 target
zones in which individuals residing in those zones would be given the section 3 preference; maintaining the affirmative
action plan that is currently required in the codified part 135 regulations; providing a financial reward to recipients
and contractors that exceed minimum section 3 requirements; providing for ``first source'' agreements with resident
councils and community organizations; and establishing permanent section 3 committees in each jurisdiction to
oversee the planning and implementation of section 3 within the jurisdiction.

 The Department is appreciative of all these suggestions and others that were offered by commenters. The statute does

 Although the statute is very specific concerning the types of public and Indian housing assistance covered by section
3, to the extent that any HUD housing or community development assistance is expended for housing rehabilitation,
housing construction or other public construction, the HUD assistance is covered by section 3, and that would include
assistance provided under the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program.

Federal Agencies. The commenter noted that the Department of Agriculture has not only the Farmers Home Administration
rental and homeownership programs for low-income people, but water and sewer community development programs, and
the Department of Commerce administers a number of programs designed to stimulate small businesses and other investments
that promote the development of communities.

 Because programs to which section 3 applies may change over time (new programs are created, existing programs are

that are covered by section 3 will contain reference to applicability of section 3 in their program regulations, guidelines,
or notices of funding availability. Additionally, FHEO will attempt to publish annually, at the beginning of each

 One commenter asked that the rule clarify the relationship between part 135 and part 963. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Part 963 entitled ``Contracting with Resident-Owned Businesses'' was created before the recent amendments to section
3 by the 1992 Act. Section 3, before the 1992 amendments, while providing a preference for low-income persons, did
not give priority consideration to residents of public housing, or to businesses owned by residents of public housing.
Accordingly, the purpose of the part 963 program, at the time of creation, was to encourage (not require) PHAs, in their
contracting, to award contracts to section 3 business concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To a large extent, the new section 3 regulations supersede part 963. Part 135 requires (consistent with section 3)
that PHAs give preference in contracting to resident-owned businesses. Part 963 does not require preference in contracting
with resident-owned businesses because part 963 is not based on statutory authority that mandates this preference.
Part 963 is totally voluntary. Part 963 imposes a monetary cap on the amount of contract that can be awarded to a resident-owned
business. (This amount is being increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000 in the conforming amendment rule being published
under a separate rule in this edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) No monetary cap is imposed by part 135. Contracts covered by part 963 include contracts for the purchase of materials
and supplies. Covered contracts under part 135, as discussed earlier in this preamble, do not include contracts for
the purchase of materials and supplies because the section 3 statute uses the term ``contract for work.'' Part 963
complements section 3, and provides an effective means by which the section 3 contracting preference can be implemented.

 The Department believes that one of the principal purposes of section 3 is to promote the growth of ``profit-making''

concerns that are not major sources of employment for low-income persons to increase their employment of these persons.

stated that section 915 of the 1992 Act makes clear that section 3 covered contractors are contractors employed by
public and Indian housing authorities and by units of local government receiving Federal financial assistance.
The commenter stated that the definition for this term should be revised to state that a contractor ``is any entity
employed by a public housing authority or a unit of local government to perform work on a section 3 covered project.''

 The definition of ``metropolitan area'' is the standard definition for this term used in all, or if not all, the majority
of Federal regulations. The statute recognized that ``metropolitan area'' covers a broad geographical area, which
is why the statute directs recipients to first give preferences to low- and very low-income residents and businesses
within smaller geographical areas. For HAs, these smaller geographical areas are housing developments; and for
other recipients, these smaller geographical areas are the service area or neighborhood in which the section 3 covered
project is located.

 Four commenters objected to the inclusion of ``soft costs'' in the definition of ``project cost.'' Soft costs are
costs associated with the financing and development of the project and relocation costs and land acquisition costs.
The commenters stated that these costs which refer to costs such as accounting, architectural, and engineering are
``unrealistic.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of ``project cost'' is no longer in the regulation. By ``unrealistic,'' the Department assumes that
the commenters mean that recipients or contractors will be unable to identify section 3 residents or section 3 business
concerns that have skills in the areas of accounting, architecture, engineering, and related professions (professional
opportunities that may be covered by section 3 depending upon the project or activity for which section 3 covered assistance
is expended). The recent closing of military bases, and factories, and major industry plants have left many skilled
professionals unemployed. Therefore, it is not totally unrealistic that low- or very low-income persons may have
skills in the professions identified above.

The proposed rule defined ``service area'' to mean the geographical area in which the persons benefitting from the
section 3 covered project reside, but which shall not extend beyond the unit of general local government in which the
section 3 covered assistance is expended. The Department recognizes that this definition allows recipients to define
the service area narrowly or broadly. The Department prefers to give recipients the flexibility to define the applicable
service area, and declines at this stage to impose further limitations on recipients' assessment of the applicable
service area. The Department anticipates that recipients will make a good faith effort to determine a realistic service
area.

 The Department's intent was not to discourage participation by HAs in establishing apprenticeship programs, but
to advise that participation in training programs in which the extent of an HA's participation is limited to referral
of residents to the training program does not constitute compliance with section 3. The HA's participation must be
more active, and provide for training and employment.

 This decision is one that rests with the housing authority. The housing authority, however, should take measures
to ensure that there is no conflict of interest in hiring decisions and in the award of contracts involving other residents.
For example, a resident employed by the PHA and that has a financial interest in a resident-owned business should not
be involved in the HA's decisions awarding contracts to resident-owned businesses.

 An HA that undertakes such action, which is commendable, may very well be in compliance with section 3. The Department
emphasizes, however, that the requirements of section 3 are triggered by economic opportunities generated by the
expenditure of certain HUD assistance. A housing authority that uses funds, other than section 3 covered assistance,
to improve the economic situation of their residents deserves commendation and credit. However, the fact that the
HA may be locating economic opportunities for their residents through such means, does not relieve the HA of the responsibility
imposed by section 3 to recruit low- and very low-income residents, or to solicit section 3 business concerns for economic
opportunities arising from the expenditure of section 3 covered activity. The fact that economic opportunities
are generated from section 3 covered assistance triggers the applicability of section 3.

 The Department cannot dictate the types of jobs for which recipients and contractors must give preference to low-income
and very low-income persons. Again, section 3 is not a job creation program. The economic opportunities that are available
to low and very low-income persons are those that the recipient or contractor has determined are necessary for the
project or activity funded by section 3 covered assistance and that would be available on the job or contract market
with or without section 3. However, the objective of section 3 is to provide low- and very low-income persons, especially
those on government assistance, with the types of economic opportunities that will allow them to become self-sufficient.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters stated that the rule should emphasize that section 3 does not mandate the employment of any low-income
person who is not qualified for job for which he or she applied.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A majority of the commenters raised objections to the requirement in the proposed rule that recipients must monitor
the operations of their contractors and subcontractors to ensure compliance with the regulations of part 135, and
questioned how recipients were to perform this monitoring function.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed in the response to the fourth comment under the ``General Comments'' section, while the interim rule
continues to require recipients to ensure that their contractors and subcontractors are in compliance with section
3, this responsibility is not the same as the ``monitoring'' responsibility imposed on recipients by the proposed
rule.

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50, which implements section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) at the time
of development of the proposed rule. This Finding remains applicable to this interim rule, and is available for public
inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel,
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.

This interim rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 as a significant
regulatory action. Any changes made in this interim rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket
file, which is available for public inspection in the Office of HUD's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh St.
SW, Washington, DC.

Impact on Small Entities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
interim rule, and, in so doing, certifies that the interim rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Recipients and contractors that receive HUD financial assistance subject to the requirements
are currently required, to the greatest extent feasible, to give economic opportunities generated by such assistance
to low-income persons, and to businesses owned by or that substantially employ low-income persons. This interim
rule, which implements the amendments made to section 3 by the 1992 Act, provides greater guidance on how the requirements
of section 3 may be met, and decreases the administrative burden on recipients from that contained in the existing
part 135 regulations. The interim rule eliminates much of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the proposed
rule, and provides recipients and contractors with greater flexibility in complying with section 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department anticipates that the interim rule will increase the number of small businesses that will benefit
from the implementation of amended section 3, the Department also anticipates that the lower dollar threshold in
HUD's housing and community development programs (lower than that provided in the previous codified part 135 regulations),
and the absence of a dollar threshold in HUD's public and Indian housing programs, may increase the number of small
business concerns that will be subject to compliance with the part 135 regulations. However, as with those small businesses
expected to benefit from the revised part 135 regulations, the increase in the number of small businesses that may
be made subject to compliance with part 135 is not considered so great as to constitute a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that this interim rule would not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or on the relationship
between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various
levels of government. The interim rule provides, consistent with section 3, that the preference requirements of
section 3 are to be carried out consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the interim rule may have the potential to promote family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. If the revised part 135 regulations, implemented by this interim rule, contribute to successful implementation
of section 3, an increased number of low-income persons will be employed which may promote family unification and
general well-being. Since the impact of this interim rule is anticipated to be beneficial, no further review under
the Order is necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nothing in this part 135 prescribes specific methods of procurement. However, neither section 3 nor the requirements
of this part 135 supersede the general requirement of 24 CFR 85.36(c) that all procurement transactions be conducted
in a competitive manner. Consistent with 24 CFR 85.36(c)(2), section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages,
to the maximum extent feasible, a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Multifamily project mortgagors in the Flexible Subsidy Program are not required to utilize the methods of procurement
in 24 CFR 85.36(d), and are not permitted to utilize methods of procurement that would result in their award of a contract
to a business concern that submits a bid higher than the lowest responsive bid. A multifamily project mortgagor, however,
must ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, the procurement practices it selects provide preference to section
3 business concerns.

 Nothing in this part prescribes specific methods of procurement for grants and other agreements with institutions
of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations. Consistent with the requirements set forth
in OMB Circular No. A&hyph;110, section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages a geographic preference
in the evaluation of bids or proposals.

 Certain construction contracts are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wages determined
under Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a_276a&hyph;7) and implementing U.S. Department of Labor regulations in 29
CFR part 5. Additionally, certain HUD-assisted rehabilitation and maintenance activities on public and Indian
housing developments are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wage rates, as determined
or adopted by HUD, to laborers and mechanics employed in this work. Apprentices and trainees may be utilized on this
work only to the extent permitted under either Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR part 5 or for work subject to
HUD-determined prevailing wage rates, HUD policies and guidelines. These requirements include adherence to the
wage rates and ratios of apprentices or trainees to journeymen set out in ``approved apprenticeship and training
programs,'' as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

the Department of Labor, or a State Apprenticeship Agency, or an on-the-job training program approved by the Bureau
of Apprenticeship and Training, in accordance with the regulations at 29 CFR part 5; or a training program approved

local governments receiving funds from the section 3 covered assistance which meet the thresholds for applicability
set forth at 135.3. The State or county must inform units of local government to whom funds are distributed of the requirements
of this part; assist local governments and their contractors in meeting the requirements and objectives of this part;
and monitor the performance of local governments with respect to the objectives and requirements of this part.

A. The work to be performed under this contract is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u (section 3). The purpose of section 3 is to ensure that employment and other
economic opportunities generated by HUD assistance or HUD-assisted projects covered by section 3, shall, to the
greatest extent feasible, be directed to low- and very low-income persons, particularly persons who are recipients
of HUD assistance for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The parties to this contract agree to comply with HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 135, which implement section 3.
As evidenced by their execution of this contract, the parties to this contract certify that they are under no contractual
or other impediment that would prevent them from complying with the part 135 regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The contractor agrees to send to each labor organization or representative of workers with which the contractor
has a collective bargaining agreement or other understanding, if any, a notice advising the labor organization or
workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under this section 3 clause, and will post copies of the
notice in conspicuous places at the work site where both employees and applicants for training and employment positions
can see the notice. The notice shall describe the section 3 preference, shall set forth minimum number and job titles
subject to hire, availability of apprenticeship and training positions, the qualifications for each; and the name
and location of the person(s) taking applications for each of the positions; and the anticipated date the work shall

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. The contractor will certify that any vacant employment positions, including training positions, that are filled
(1) after the contractor is selected but before the contract is executed, and (2) with persons other than those to whom
the regulations of 24 CFR part 135 require employment opportunities to be directed, were not filled to circumvent
the contractor's obligations under 24 CFR part 135. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Noncompliance with HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 135 may result in sanctions, termination of this contract for

III. Examples of Procurement Procedures That Provide for Preference for Section 3 Business Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Section III provides specific procedures that may be followed by recipients and contractors (collectively,
referred to as the ``contracting party'') for implementing the section 3 contracting preference for each of the competitive
procurement methods authorized in 24 CFR 85.36(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Small Purchase Procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For section 3 covered contracts aggregating no more than $25,000, the methods set forth in this paragraph (1) or the
more formal procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Section III may be utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Solicitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Quotations may be solicited by telephone, letter or other informal procedure provided that the manner of solicitation
provides for participation by a reasonable number of competitive sources. At the time of solicitation, the parties
must be informed of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_the section 3 covered contract to be awarded with sufficient specificity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of three qualified sources in order to promote competition. Fewer than three quotations are acceptable when the contracting
party has attempted, but has been unable, to obtain a sufficient number of competitive quotations. In unusual circumstances,
the contracting party may accept the sole quotation received in response to a solicitation provided the price is reasonable.
In all cases, the contracting party shall document the circumstances when it has been unable to obtain at least three
quotations.

Award. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based upon the lowest price, the contract shall be awarded
to the qualified section 3 business concern with the lowest responsive quotation, if it is reasonable and no more than
10 percent higher than the quotation of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source. If no responsive
quotation by a qualified section 3 business concern is within 10 percent of the lowest responsive quotation from any
qualified source, the award shall be made to the source with the lowest quotation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based on factors other than price, a request for quotations
shall be issued by developing the particulars of the solicitation, including a rating system for the assignment of
points to evaluate the merits of each quotation. The solicitation shall identify all factors to be considered, including
price or cost. The rating system shall provide for a range of 15 to 25 percent of the total number of available rating
points to be set aside for the provision of preference for section 3 business concerns. The purchase order shall be
awarded to the responsible firm whose quotation is the most advantageous, considering price and all other factors
specified in the rating system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) For contracts and subcontracts awarded under the competitive proposals method of procurement (24 CFR 85.36(d)(3)),
a Request for Proposals (RFP) shall identify all evaluation factors (and their relative importance) to be used to
rate proposals.

(ii) One of the evaluation factors shall address both the preference for section 3 business concerns and the acceptability
of the strategy for meeting the greatest extent feasible requirement (section 3 strategy), as disclosed in proposals
submitted by all business concerns (section 3 and non-section 3 business concerns). This factor shall provide for

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The component of this evaluation factor designed to address the preference for section 3 business concerns

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (section 3), as amended by the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992, requires that economic opportunities generated by HUD financial assistance for housing (including
public and Indian housing) and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be given to
low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing, and
to businesses that provide economic opportunities for these persons. Elsewhere in today's edition of the

, the Department has published an interim rule that makes comprehensive amendments to HUD's section 3 regulations
at 24 CFR part 135 to bring these regulations into conformity with the changes made to section 3 by the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992. The section 3 (part 135) interim rule is based on the proposed rule published on October 8,

I. Background_Conforming Amendments Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Since its enactment, section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) has been a statutory
basis for promoting the award of jobs and contracts, generated from projects receiving HUD financial assistance,
to, respectively, low-income residents and businesses of the areas where the projects to be assisted are located.
Section 3 was recently amended, in its entirety, by section 915 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992
(Pub.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act). Although the 1992 Act significantly revised section
3, it did not alter the objective of section 3_to provide economic opportunities to low-income persons. The 1992 Act,
in fact, strengthens the section 3 mandate by: clarifying the types of HUD financial assistance, activities, and
recipients subject to the requirements of section 3; identifying the specific individuals and businesses who are
the intended beneficiaries of the economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities; and establishing
the order of priority in which these individuals and businesses should be recruited and solicited for the employment
and other economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in today's edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Department has published an interim rule which makes comprehensive amendments to HUD's section 3 regulations
at 24 CFR part 135 to bring these regulations into conformity with the changes made to section 3 by the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992. The section 3 (part 135) interim rule is based on the proposed rule published on October 8,
1993, and takes into consideration public comment received on the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes final a conforming amendments proposed rule published on October 8, 1993, and which was a companion
rule to the section 3 (part 135) proposed rule also published on October 8, 1993. The October 8, 1993 ``conforming amendments
rule'' proposed to make conforming amendments to several parts in title 24 of the Code of Regulations to include reference
to the applicability of the part 135 regulations to the HUD program addressed by these parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several HUD programs, particularly new HUD programs, include in their program requirements the applicability of
section 3 to the program, but do not require compliance with the part 135 regulations. (See, for example, 24 CFR parts
576, 583, 700.) Compliance with the part 135 regulations was not included because the part 135 regulations had not
been updated to reflect statutory amendments. (The part 135 regulations have not been amended substantively since
their original adoption in 1973, although statutory amendments were made to section 3 in 1974 and 1980.) Additionally,
several parts in 24 CFR currently refer to the part 135 regulations, but include reference to the former statutory
language of section 3 (i.e., before its amendment by section 915 of the 1992 Act, the title of section 3 was ``Employment
Opportunities for Businesses and Lower Income Persons in Connection with Assisted Projects''). The Department
notes, however, that not all parts in 24 CFR which reference section 3 and the part 135 regulations require conforming
amendments. (For example, see 24 CFR 941.208(a).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 8, 1993 conforming amendments rule also proposed to amend 24 CFR part 963_Contracting with Resident-Owned
Businesses_to raise the dollar contract limit from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The purpose of the alternative procurement
process provided by part 963 is to encourage PHAs to contract with resident-owned businesses for public housing services,
supplies, or construction. The increase in the dollar contract limit is directed to encouraging additional contract
opportunities for resident-owned businesses, which is consistent with the objectives of section 3.

II. Conforming Amendments Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No public comments were received on the October 8, 1993 conforming amendments proposed rule. Accordingly, the Department,
through this rule, adopts, as final, the conforming amendments set forth in the October 8, 1993 proposed rule, with
some additional changes as described in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Revision to Conforming Amendment to Part 219
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The October 8, 1993 conforming amendments proposed rule included a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 219 which contains
the regulations for the Flexible Subsidy Program. However, the October 8, 1993 conforming amendment made reference
to the $7,500 threshold which is no longer applicable, because it has been removed by the section 3 (part 135) interim
rule, published elsewhere in today's edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 3 interim rule provides one set of thresholds applicable to all HUD housing and community development
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, on December 6, 1993, the Department published a final rule that amended 24 CFR part 219 to implement
the changes made to the Flexible Subsidy Program by the 1992 Act (58 FR 64138). This December 6, 1993 final rule included
references to the applicability of section 3 and the regulations of part 135 to the Flexible Subsidy Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This conforming amendments final rule makes two changes to the amendments made by the December 6, 1939 final rule.
The December 6, 1993 final rule included a reference to section 3 and the regulations in part 135 under the requirements
applicable to Flexible Subsidy operating assistance. However, section 3, as amended by the 1992 Act, is no longer
applicable to Flexible Subsidy operating assistance. Therefore this conforming amendments rule removes this reference.
In addition, this conforming amendments rule makes a minor change to the reference to section 3 and the regulations
in part 135 under the capital improvement requirements. Section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to
capital improvement assistance, but as the section 3 (part 135) rule provides, this applicability is limited to housing
rehabilitation, housing construction and other public construction projects as provided in part 135, and subject
to the thresholds provided in part 135. This conforming amendments final rule clarifies the limited applicability
of section 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Addition of Conforming Amendment to Part 280
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The October 8, 1993 conforming amendment proposed rule inadvertently omitted a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part
280 (Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants). Section 280.207 of this part currently contains a reference to section
3 and the part 135 regulations. However, the reference section 3 includes statutory language that has been removed
from the 1992 Act amendment to section 3. The conforming amendment made to part 280 by this final rule removes the outdated
statutory language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of Conforming Amendment to Part 700
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The October 8, 1993 conforming amendment proposed rule included a conforming amendment for 24 CFR part 700 (Congregate
Housing Services Program). This program currently does not provide assistance for housing rehabilitation, housing
construction or other public construction projects, which would be extent of coverage by section 3 and the regulations
in part 135 for this Housing program. Accordingly, the conforming amendment to part 700 is removed by this final rule.
If and when the Congregate Housing Services Program provides assistance for these three types of section 3 covered
projects, the regulations in part 700 will be amended to include reference to the applicability of section 3 and the
regulations in part 135. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Addition of Conforming Amendment to Part 882, Subpart G
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule also includes a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 882, subpart G. As discussed in the section 3 (part
135) interim rule, the Department has determined that section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to section
8 project-based assistance that is expended for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public
construction project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Addition of Section Conforming Amendment to Part 905
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The October 8, 1993 proposed rule included a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 905 (Indian Housing Programs), but
only in the section of the rule (&sect;905.165) which addresses the subject of Indian preference in employment and
contracting. The October 8, 1993 inadvertently failed to include a reference to section 3 and the regulations of part
135 in &sect;905.120, which lists other applicable Federal requirements. This conforming amendments final rule
corrects this error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 3 (Part 135) Interim Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department again points out that the section 3 (part 135) rule published elsewhere in today's edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is being published as an interim rule. The Department received substantial comment on the October 8, 1993 section
3 proposed rule, has made a number of changes to the section 3 regulations as a result of public comment, and seeks additional
public comment on the section 3 rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Impact on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
rule, and, in so doing, certifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This final rule makes conforming amendments to various parts in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations
that include reference (and thus update this reference), or that should include reference to the part 135 regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In connection with the development of the section 3 (part 135) proposed rule, a Finding of No Significant Impact with
respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C)
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). That Finding of No Significant Impact was applicable
to the October 8, 1993 conforming amendments proposed rule, and remains applicable to the section 3 (part 135) interim
rule and this conforming amendments final rule. The Finding remains available for public inspection during regular
business hours in the Office of the General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington,
DC 20410.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has determined that this rule would not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or on the relationship between
the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various levels
of government. The rule simply makes conforming amendments to various parts in 24 CFR that include reference (and
thus update this reference), or that should include reference to the part 135 regulations. The part 135 interim rule,
published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provides, consistent with the section 915 of the 1992 Act, that the preference requirements of section 3 are to be carried
out consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has determined that this final rule does not have the potential to promote family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being, and thus is not subject to review under the order. This final rule simply makes conforming amendments
to several parts in 24 CFR to update reference, or include reference to the part 135 regulations. No change in existing
HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate
to family concerns.
