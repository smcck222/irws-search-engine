The changes in the national average payment rates and the food service payment rates for day care homes reflect a 1.7
percent increase during the 12-month period May 1993 to May 1994 (from 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994) in the food
away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
of the Department of Labor. The changes in the administrative reimbursement rates for sponsoring organizations
of day care homes reflect a 2.3 percent increase during the 12-month period May 1993 to May 1994 (from 144.2 in May 1993
to 147.5 in May 1994) in the series for all items of the Consumers Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces the value of donated foods or, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable, cash in lieu thereof to be provided in the 1995 school year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each lunch served by schools participating in the National School Lunch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program (NSLP) or by commodity schools and for each lunch and supper served by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program.

This notice also announces that the value of agricultural commodities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other foods provided to States during the past school year met the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance authorized under the National School Lunch Act. Thus, there will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be no shortfall cash payments to States for the NSLP for the 1994 school year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annually programmed level of assistance was met in food donations by June

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice implements mandatory provisions of sections 6(e), 14(f) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1755(e), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)). Section 6(e)(1)(A) of the Act establishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national average value of donated food assistance to be given to States for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each lunch served in NSLP at 11.00 cents per meal. Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e)(1)(B), this amount is subject to annual adjustments as of July 1 of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions. Section 17(h)(1) of the Act provides that the same value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance in donated foods for school lunches shall also be established for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lunches and suppers served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is hereby given that the national average minimum value of donated foods, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash in lieu thereof, per lunch under NSLP (7 CFR part 210) and per lunch and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supper under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14.50 cents for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions is computed on the basis of five major food components in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy products; processed fruits and vegetables; and fats and oils). Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component is assigned a proportional value using the appropriate relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The value of food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance is adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a three- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month simple average value of this Price Index for March, April and May. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-month average of the Price Index increased by 2.92 percent from 123.23 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for March, April and May of 1993 to 126.83 for the same three months in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When computed on the basis of unrounded data and rounded to the nearest one-quarter cent, the resulting national average
for the period July 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through June 30, 1995 will be 14.50 cents per meal. This is an increase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.50 cents from the school year 1994 rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 14(f) of the Act provides that commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated foods equal in value
to the sum of the national average value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and the national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average payment established under section 4 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1753). Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools are eligible to receive up to 5 cents of this value in cash for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing and handling expenses related to the use of such foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commodity schools are defined in section 12(d)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1760(d)(7)) as ``schools that do not participate in the school lunch program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this Act, but which receive commodities made available by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use by such schools in nonprofit lunch programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1995 school year, commodity schools shall be eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated food assistance valued at 31.50 cents for each lunch served. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount is based on the sum of the section 6(e) level of assistance announced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this notice and the adjusted section 4 minimum national average payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor for school year 1995. The section 4 factor for commodity schools does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include the two cents per lunch increase for schools where 60 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lunches were served in the second preceding year free or at reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices, since that increase is applicable only to schools participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National School Lunch Program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1755(b)) and the regulations governing cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lieu of donated foods (7 CFR part 240) require the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by June 1 of each school year to estimate the value of agricultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and other foods that will be delivered to States during that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school year. Under the food distribution regulations (7 CFR part 250), these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods are used by schools participating in NSLP. If the estimated value is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the total level of commodity assistance authorized under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e) of the Act, the Secretary is required by July 1 of that school year to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay to each State educational agency funds equal to the difference between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of programmed deliveries and the total level of authorized assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past school year the adjusted minimum national average value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated foods or payments of cash in lieu thereof per lunch was 14.00 cents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 6(e) of the Act, the mandated level of commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance was $566,188,578 for school year 1994. The Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that at least that amount was available for delivery nationally by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994 to meet the mandated level of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given, therefore, that no shortfall cash payments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made for the school year ending June 30, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice announces the annual adjustments to: (1) The ``national average payments,'' the amount of money the Federal
Government provides States for lunches and breakfasts served to children participating in the National School Lunch
and School Breakfast Programs; (2) the ``maximum reimbursement rates,'' the maximum per lunch rate from Federal
funds that a State can provide a school food authority for lunches served to children participating in the National
School Lunch Program; and (3) the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school
or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program for Children. The payments and rates are prescribed
on an annual basis each July. The annual payments and rates adjustments for the school lunch and school breakfast programs
reflect changes in the Food Away From Home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The annual rate
adjustment for milk reflects changes in the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products. These payments and rates
are in effect from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.

Special Milk Program for Children
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Pursuant to section 3 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1772), the Department announces the
rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school or institution which participates
in the Special Milk Program for Children. This rate is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index
for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the period July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995, the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to a nonneedy child
in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program is 11.00 cents. This reflects no change over
the current reimbursement rate because the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231) from May 1993
to May 1994 (from a level of 120.6 in May 1993 to 121.1 in May 1994) did not change significantly enough to trigger a change
in the reimbursement rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a reminder, schools or institutions with pricing programs which elect to serve milk free to eligible children continue
to receive the average cost of a half-pint of milk (the total cost of all milk purchased during the claim period divided
by the total number of purchased half-pints) for each half-pint served to an eligible child.

National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Pursuant to section 11 of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1759a), and section 4 of the Child Nutrition
Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1773), the Department annually announces the adjustments to the National Average
Payment Factors and to the maximum Federal reimbursement rates for meals served to children participating in the
National School Lunch Program. Adjustments are prescribed each July 1, based on changes in the Food Away From Home
series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department
of Labor. The changes in the national average payment rates for schools and residential child care institutions for
the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995 reflect a 1.7 percent increase in the Price Index during the 12-month period
May 1993 to May 1994 (from a level of 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994).

Lunch Payment Factors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Section 4 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753) provides general cash for food assistance payments to
States to assist schools in purchasing food. There are two section 4 National Average Payment Factors for lunches
served under the National School Lunch Program. The lower payment factor applies to lunches served by school food
authorities in which less than 60 percent of the lunches served in the school lunch program during the second preceding
school year were served free or at a reduced price. The higher payment factor applies to lunches served by school food
authorities in which 60 percent or more of the lunches served during the second preceding school year were served free
or at a reduced price. To supplement these section 4 payments, section 11 of the National School Lunch Act provides
special cash assistance payments to aid schools in providing free and reduced-price lunches. The section 11 National
Average Payment Factor for each reduced-price lunch served is set at 40 cents less than the factor for each free lunch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As authorized under sections 8 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act, maximum reimbursement rates for each type of
lunch are prescribed by the Department in this Notice. These maximum rates ensure equitable disbursement of Federal
funds to school food authorities.

Breakfast Payment Factors

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 establishes National Average Payment Factors for free, reduced-price
and paid breakfasts served under the School Breakfast Program and additional payments for schools determined to
be in ``severe need'' because they serve a high percentage of needy children.

The following specific section 4 and section 11 National Average Payment Factors and maximum reimbursement rates
are in effect through June 30, 1995. Due to a higher cost of living, the average payments and maximum reimbursements
for Alaska and Hawaii are higher than those for all other States. The District of Columbia, Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico and the Pacific Territories use the figures specified for the contiguous States.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 24, 1991 a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Boulder tony Timber Sale
and Other Projects on the Siuslaw National Forest was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 33903). Because of new direction in the President's Forest Plan, the proposed project is no longer consistent
with Forest management objectives. The Forest Service has decided to terminate the environmental analysis for this
EIS. There will be no draft or final EIS for the Boulder Tony timber sale and other projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicated that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Donald W. Gohmert, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project purposes are reduced interior marsh losses and shoreline erosion. The planned works of improvement include
eight fixed crest weirs with boat bays, three canal plugs with flapgated culverts, seven canal plugs, four earthen
overflow banks (a total of 30,730 feet), and two rock overflow banks (a total of 5,338 feet).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program provides support for planning, conducting, administering, and evaluating centers for independent
living (centers) that comply with the standards and assurances in section 725 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act),
as amended, consistent with the State plan for establishing a statewide network of centers. Centers are consumer-controlled,
community-based, cross-disability, nonresidential private nonprofit agencies that are designed and operated
within local communities by individuals with disabilities and provide an array of independent living (IL) services.

Applicable Regulations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82,
85, and 86; and (b) The program regulations in 34 CFR Parts 364 and 366. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September
30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the NPRM ended on June 13, 1994. A total of 40 comments were received from centers (21), State
agencies (11), Statewide Independent Living Councils and other statewide organizations (4), national constituent
organizations (3), and an individual (1). The comments were generally favorable and constructive. The following
is a summary of the substantive comments received on the NPRM and of the changes that are expected to be made, based on
public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review and that may affect applicants under
this competition. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized
to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one commenter objected to the 30-day comment period. The Secretary considered a 30-day comment period necessary
because a longer comment period would not have left enough time to publish this notice inviting applications for competitive
awards for new centers under this program for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Secretary also considered a 30-day comment
period adequate because of the extensive opportunity for input and comment that was afforded to the public prior to
publishing the NPRM. The Secretary does not believe it is necessary to extend the comment period.

Part 364 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters objected to the change in terminology from an individual with ``severe'' disabilities to an individual
with ``significant'' disabilities. Although only one comment specifically complimenting the Department on the
use of ``significant'' rather than ``severe'' was received in response to the NPRM, the IL community previously expressed
overwhelming support for the change in comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking on the proposed nomenclature
change published on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57938). Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change in the final
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters suggested changes to the definitions in proposed &sect;364.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters were concerned that the proposed definition of ``advocacy'' may be interpreted to require an advocate
to be an attorney. One of these commenters suggested a broader definition of ``advocacy.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of ``advocacy'' specifically states that, to the extent permitted by State law or the rules
of any agency before which an individual is appearing, a non-lawyer may engage in advocacy on behalf of another individual.
The Secretary does not interpret this definition as requiring an advocate to be an attorney in all cases, but only in
those situations where State law or the rules of an agency require that an advocate representing another individual
be an attorney. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change to this definition in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that the proposed definition of ``attendant care'' be revised to make it clear that this service
may be provided on the job and in the community, as well as at home. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes the proposed definition provides adequate flexibility to allow attendant care in a variety
of situations. Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change to this definition in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters questioned why the words ``cognitive'' and ``sensory'' do not appear in the proposed definition of ``individual
with significant disabilities.'' These commenters noted that the proposed definition conflicts with the proposed
definition of an ``individual with a disability.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concepts of ``physical'' and ``mental'' impairments in the statutory definitions of ``individual with a severe
disability'' and ``individual with a disability'' include the concepts of ``sensory'' and ``cognitive'' impairments,
respectively. However, the Secretary agrees that the definitions of ``individual with a significant disability''
and ``individual with a disability'' should be consistent. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates adding the words
``sensory'' and ``cognitive'' to the definition of ``individual with a significant disability'' in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed &sect;364.5, commenters objected to the limitation on reallocating expenditures after the initiation
of an audit or compliance review and considered it punitive and contrary to ordinary accounting procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that a change is necessary to make this requirement consistent with acceptable accounting practices.
Therefore, the Secretary anticipates changing &sect;364.5 in the final regulations to allow costs that a grantee
intends to use as an offset against disallowed costs, if those costs are reported on the final financial status reports
within 90 days after the completion of an audit or compliance review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters objected to the language in proposed &sect;&sect;364.6 and 364.7 regarding program income. Commenters
asserted that the resource development requirement in evaluation standard 7 in section 725(b)(7) of the Act should
be interpreted to permit centers to accumulate funds over several years to create, among other financial instruments,
endowments and reserves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that imposing time limits on the use of program income may be inconsistent with long-term ``resource
development,'' which may include endowment drives and the solicitation of gifts and bequests that may produce long-term
income. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates changing the language in proposed &sect;&sect;364.6 and 364.7 in
the final regulations to allow centers to use program income to establish endowments and other similar financial
instruments, but only if the corpus and income generated from the endowment and other similar financial instruments
are used solely to carry out the purposes of the Center for Independent Living (CIL) program authorized under Part
C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the use of the term ``special'' when referring to reasonable accommodation and ``alternative''
modes of communication in proposed &sect;&sect;364.20, 364.23, and 364.56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter and anticipates substituting the word ``alternative'' for the word ``special''
in these sections of the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters expressed concern regarding access to records in proposed &sect;364.37(c) on the grounds that access
to individual records may be unnecessarily intrusive and inconsistent with commitments that providers make to their
consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that access to individual case records or files or consumer service records is necessary for
the proper and efficient administration and monitoring of the CIL program. Proposed &sect;364.37(c) limits this
access to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives.
The Secretary does not believe that this access is unreasonable or that it will be abused. Therefore, the Secretary
does not expect any change in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were concerned that the references to ``legally authorized representative'' in proposed &sect;364.51
may be interpreted to require an attorney or legal guardian. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not intend to require that only an attorney or legal guardian may represent an individual for purposes
of proposed &sect;364.51(b)(2)(requirements pertaining to ineligibility determinations). Therefore, the Secretary
anticipates adding a definition of ``legally authorized representative'' to the final regulations to clarify that
an individual's authority to represent or advocate on behalf of an individual with significant disabilities is determined
pursuant to State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters objected to the absence of requirements in proposed &sect;364.52 regarding the content of a waiver
and the appropriate solicitation of a waiver. One of the commenters also was concerned that the absence of conditions
on the use of waivers could allow service providers to circumvent the requirements of proposed &sect;&sect;364.43
(provision of IL services by the State) and 364.53 (documentation of IL services provided to individuals). One of
the commenters also suggested that the regulations should require that consumers be advised of the need for an IL plan
and how the IL plan helps protect the consumer's rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees in part with the commenters and anticipates adding the words ``knowingly and voluntarily''
before the word ``signs'' in &sect;364.52(a)(2) of the final regulations. The Secretary believes this is adequate
protection to prevent the possibility of service providers forcing consumers to sign ``waivers.'' The Secretary
does not believe that it is necessary to add further requirements regarding the waiver of an IL plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters suggested that proposed &sect;364.53 be modified to recognize the fact that records may be electronic
as well as written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters. With the exception of an IL plan or a waiver of an IL plan, both of which require
a consumer's signature, the Secretary anticipates revising &sect;364.53 in the final regulations to allow records
to be maintained electronically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that the State standards in proposed &sect;364.55 should not be permitted to exceed the standards
in section 725 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards referred to in proposed &sect;364.55 are actually the standards that the designated State unit (DSU)
is required to develop pursuant to proposed &sect;365.31 for those service providers that are not centers or for centers
that are providing specialized IL services under a contract with the DSU. The Secretary anticipates adding language
to the final regulations to make this clear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the words ``other information'' in proposed &sect;364.56(c)(2) because of the possibility
that service providers may use this language to withhold information from a consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.56(c)(2) does not permit a service provider to withhold information from a consumer. Proposed
&sect;364.56(c)(2) merely requires that, if a service provider determines that releasing medical, psychological,
or other information may be harmful if released directly to the consumer, the service provider shall release this
information to the consumer through a qualified medical or psychological professional or the individual's legally
authorized representative. The Secretary does not expect any change to &sect;364.56(c)(2) in the final regulations.

Part 366
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested adding a requirement to the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.27 that the governing
board be reflective of the localities to be served by the proposed center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that, rather than adding the suggested language to the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.27,
replacing the words ``another'' and ``other'' in proposed &sect;366.28(a) with ``bordering'' and adding similar
language in &sect;&sect;366.2(a)(1)(i), 366.28(a), and 366.29(a) of the final regulations is more appropriate.
In this manner, centers will be limited to operating within a ``local community,'' as required by section 702(1)(A)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter considered the selection criterion in proposed &sect;366.27(a)(2) too vague and suggested that it
be expanded to ``not appear to be the traditional `needs assessment' that creates more service providers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the criterion adequately explains how an applicant can be expected to identify the need
for a new center in a community and how the applicant plans to address this identified need. The Secretary does not expect
any change in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested reducing the points allotted to ``plan of operation'' and increasing points for ``involvement
of individuals with significant disabilities'' in the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.27(g) and (h),
respectively. Commenters also felt that the proposed selection criteria should include the involvement of individuals
with significant disabilities in the preparation of a center's application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the points assigned to the ``plan of operation'' selection criterion appropriately
reflect its value. The Secretary agrees that participation of individuals with significant disabilities in the
preparation of applications is important and anticipates substituting the phrase ``developing the center's application''
for the phrase ``conducting center activities'' in &sect;366.27(h)(1) of the final regulations.

Applicable Regulations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85,
and 86; and (b) The regulations for this program in 34 CFR Part 367.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September
30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking ended on June 13, 1994. Six parties submitted comments on
proposed 34 CFR Part 367. The following is a summary of the comments received and of the changes that are expected to
be made, based on public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters supported the proposed regulations as worded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended adding the word ``may'' to proposed &sect;367.3(b). (Although the commenter identified
the provision as &sect;367.1(b), the comment makes sense only if applied to proposed &sect;367.3(b).) The commenter
stated that the addition of the word ``may'' would give States flexibility in the event they have funds to cover other
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;367.3(a) states that a DSA ``may'' use funds awarded under proposed Part 367 for the activities described
in proposed &sect;&sect;367.1 and in 367.3(b). The Secretary believes that this language already provides a DSA
with adequate flexibility in choosing which services will be provided to individuals in the State. Therefore, no
change to proposed &sect;367.3(b) is expected in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested changing the definition of ``older individual who is blind'' in proposed &sect;367.5 to
make it less restrictive. Because this term is specifically defined in section 751 of the Act, no change to this definition
in proposed &sect;367.5 is expected in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended adding a definition of ``capacity building'' to proposed &sect;367.5. The Secretary
does not believe a definition is necessary because a variety of possible opportunities already exists for local,
regional, and State ``capacity building.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the list of services in proposed &sect;367.22(g) should be the same as that provided
in proposed &sect;367.3(b) and also suggested adding the word ``may'' to &sect;367.22(g)(2). The commenter also
stated that the wording in proposed &sect;367.22(g) could be construed to mean that grant funds have to be used for
all the listed services and that States should not have to duplicate services already provided by the State through
other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that the list of services in these proposed provisions should be the same. The Secretary expects
that this change will be made to proposed &sect;&sect;367.3(b) and 367.22(g)(2) in the final regulations. The Secretary
also agrees that Chapter 2 funds should be used in a way that will supplement services that may already be available
through other sources. The Secretary expects that proposed &sect;367.22(g)(2) of the final regulations will be
changed to make clear that an application will be evaluated on the extent to which the DSA will use Chapter 2 funds to
meet the unmet independent living (IL) needs of individuals in the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended including older individuals who are blind in the selection of new methods and approaches
for the provision of IL services pursuant to proposed &sect;364.28.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the views of older individuals who are blind will be adequately represented and addressed
by the Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC). The SILC and DSU have joint responsibility for development of
the State plan and for ensuring that consumers have the opportunity to comment on the development and revision of the
State plan during public hearings. The selection and incorporation into the State plan of any new approaches for the
provision of IL services to older individuals who are blind would require a revision to the State plan. Therefore,
the Secretary does not expect any changes in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended deleting proposed &sect;367.41(b), which restricts a DSA's flexibility to enter into
procurement contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 752(i)(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. 701&hyph;796i, is a
general provision that allows the DSA to operate or administer this program either directly or through grants or contracts,
section 752(g) of the Act requires that a State's awards to public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations
under this program be made only through grants. Therefore, no change to proposed &sect;367.41(b) is expected in the
final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes
contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review,
applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.

The proposed project supports specialized training in the provision of vocational rehabilitation or related services
to individuals with disabilities to increase the rehabilitation rate into competitive employment for all individuals
or specified target groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 24000), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended June 8, 1994. Sixteen parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is a summary of
the changes that are expected to be made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, based on the
public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters suggested deleting &sect;388.21(a)(4), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a minimum share of not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available to Guam, American
Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The commenters
believe agencies in the territories, some of which have as many employees as small designated State agencies, should
receive the same minimum share of not less than one-third of one percent of the amounts made available for the fiscal
year as provided in &sect;388.21(a)(3) to small agencies. The Secretary agrees that the same minimum share provided
to small designated State agencies is appropriate for the specified territories. The Secretary also notes that the
territories are eligible to compete for the remaining funds to be allocated based on the quality of the application
as determined by competitive reviews conducted by the Department using the selection criteria in &sect;388.20 and
the priorities in &sect;388.22. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.21(a) by deleting paragraph (4) so that
all grant recipients receive the same minimum share of the sums made available for the fiscal year. A revision of &sect;388.30,
deleting paragraph (c), which provides special matching considerations for the territories, is also expected to
be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested definitions for the terms ``succession planning'' and ``capacity building'' used in &sect;388.1.
The Secretary notes that these terms are found in the statute, but are optional for State agencies to address in their
in-service training. There are alternative ways to address these terms, and the Secretary prefers not to define them,
thus leaving the widest possible discretion to State agencies. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters addressed the requirement in &sect;388.20(a)(2)(iii) for an annual needs assessment of in-service
training needs. The commenters believe an annual assessment is not necessary and recommend a comprehensive needs
assessment every three years and a less comprehensive review annually. The Secretary agrees that a comprehensive
assessment is not needed annually. A revision of &sect;388.20(a)(2)(iii), deleting the word ``annual,'' is expected
to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters noted that the regulations do not specify the length of projects. Recommendations of project periods
of 36 and 60 months were made. The Secretary notes that regulations usually do not specify project duration and instead
leave flexibility for the Secretary to determine an appropriate project period each time a competition is announced.
This notice solicits applications for a 36-month period. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked that the phrase ``in connection with a distance learning training course'' be dropped from the description
of allowable telecommunications and technology fees in &sect;388.31(d). The Secretary agrees that distance learning
may include valuable in-service training activities, such as a lecture or technology demonstration, that are not
part of a training course. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.31(d) by deleting the words ``in connection
with a distance learning training course.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that it was an unnecessary limitation to require that distance education for rehabilitation workers
be at their job sites as stated in &sect;388.22(b)(2). The commenter noted that it may be necessary or efficient for
an agency to gather a group of employees at a central location removed from individual offices for distance education.
The Secretary agrees that there is no compelling reason to require in this priority that training occur at an individual
job site. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.22(b)(2) by deleting the words ``at their job sites.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested clarification of the heading for &sect;388.22(b)(3), which refers to ``specific populations''
although the text that follows refers to ``all individuals or specified groups.'' The Secretary believes that it
is up to the State agency to determine whether in-service training to improve employment outcomes will be targeted
narrowly or broadly. Activities directed to improving employment outcomes for all population groups or for a specific
target group are permitted under this priority. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter observed that the NPRM retains most of the language in the current regulations and does not accurately
reflect the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 Amendments), particularly provisions related to State
and strategic plans. The Secretary believes that extensive changes have been proposed in the current regulations
and is confident that all requirements in the 1992 Amendments have been implemented. No change is expected to be made
in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters supported reserving a portion of funds for priorities, but believe this reserve should be divided
between priorities based on need and priorities based on responsiveness or quality of the application and innovative
approaches. The Secretary believes that the three priorities listed in the proposed regulations address significant
needs of State agencies and that no further division of the priorities into categories is needed. No change is expected
to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters objected to the proposed formula in &sect;388.21 whereby 80 percent of the funds available would
be distributed based on the number of staff and 20 percent of the funds available would be distributed based on quality.
They believe that the split penalizes States with small populations with limited capacity to write grants. In the
commenters' view, the distribution does not take into account extra travel costs in a State with a large geographic
area, and a commenter suggested increasing the small State agency minimum share. The Secretary believes that the
proposed formula maximizes the amount of funds available for basic awards while ensuring that a reasonable amount
is available for small agencies and for the Secretary's priorities. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended dropping the priority in &sect;388.22(b)(2) for distance education on the grounds that
there is no evidence that distance education produces better results at less cost. The Secretary believes that distance
education is needed in some States and wants to ensure that a mechanism exists to demonstrate innovative approaches
to learning. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended deleting &sect;388.20(f)(1)(ii) of the evaluation selection criteria that would judge
in-service training outcomes by the extent to which training results in improved individual competency through
licensure, certification, or award of academic degrees or certificates. The commenters believe in-service training
to be short-term and job-based; therefore, reference to improved individual competency through degree-based programs
should be dropped. The Secretary believes that, in response to the need to increase the number of qualified rehabilitation
personnel, academic outcomes must be included among the measures of in-service training programs. No change is expected
to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters observed that reviewers for in-service proposals should be well qualified, represent diverse
populations, and be identified by name and program affiliation after the review is completed. They commented that
all applicants should receive reviewer comments. The Secretary agrees that reviewers must be qualified and representative
of the diverse populations and agencies assisted through in-service training. The Secretary does make summary information
available on characteristics of reviewers but believes the specific reviewers of proposals should remain anonymous.
All applicants are provided with the reviewer comments on their applications when the review is completed. No change
is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that &sect;388.21 does not state what the minimum score is that an applicant must receive in order
for its application to be approved by the Secretary or how it is to be computed. In order to make funding decisions, the
Secretary will set a minimum score for each competition after all applications have been reviewed. The minimum score
will be computed through an analysis of all reviewed applications to determine those that are in the fundable range.
No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

A commenter observed that &sect;388.1 should be revised, and the regulations changed throughout, to emphasize human
resource development in place of training. Peer reviewers should be oriented to human resource development prior
to their service as reviewers. The Secretary agrees that the term human resource development is descriptive of many
appropriate activities under this program. However, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, uses the term ``in-service
training,'' so that term is used in the regulations. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding &sect;388.22, which sets the Secretary's priorities, a commenter asked if an application that addresses
issues or activities other than the three priorities listed can be eligible for quality funds. The Secretary responds
that only applications that respond to the priorities already identified by the Secretary in the regulations for
this program or priorities established through future rulemaking will be considered when allocating the quality
funds. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes
contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review,
applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing
has reviewed a non-capacity related amendment of license for the City of Hamilton Hydroelectric Project, No. 2724&hyph;008.
The City of Hamilton Hydroelectric Project is located on the Miami River in Butler County, Ohio. The application is
for approval to remove and replace the existing powerhouse superstructure and lowering the elevation of the powerhouse
and generating unit. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving
the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Western Area Power Administration (Western), a Federal power marketing agency of the Department of Energy (DOE),
has developed proposed procedures to fulfill the requirements of section 2929 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for fiscal year 1994 (National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat. 1547, 1935 (1993))
(NDA Act). Under the proposed procedures to implement the requirements of the NDA Act, Western would allocate up to
119.223 megawatts (MW) of Power from the Central Valley Project (CVP), which represents the amount of CVP Power provided
as of November 30, 1993, to military installations. The NDA Act was signed into public law on November 30, 1993. Section
2929 of the NDA Act provides that, for a 10-year period beginning on November 30, 1993, the electric power allocations
provided as of November 30, 1993, by Western from the CVP to military installations in the State of California which
have been closed or approved for closure pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A, Title
XXIX, Pub. L. 101&hyph;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) (1990 Act) shall be reserved for sale through Long-Term Contracts
to Preference Entities which agree to use such Power to promote economic development at a military installation that
is closed or approved for closure pursuant to the 1990 Act. To the extent Power reserved by the NDA Act is not disposed
of through Long-Term Contracts, it shall be made available on a temporary basis during such 10-year period to military
installations in the State of California through Short-Term Contracts. By implementing these Procedures, Western
will establish the criteria to allocate the Power made available as a result of the NDA Act.

The procedures set forth in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will explain in detail how Western intends to implement the NDA Act. Under the proposed NDA Act Procedures, Western
has identified the Power that will be classified as NDA Act Power and the types of services and contracts that will be
offered. Also set forth under the proposed NDA Act Procedures are the general eligibility criteria that Western will
apply to all applicants requesting an Allocation of NDA Act Power, and the procedures to be used by applicants when
applying for NDA Act Power, which include demonstration that certain economic development criteria are being met.
Lastly, Western has set forth the procedures that will be used in allocating NDA Act Power to eligible applicants,
including a priority list developed by Western for allocating NDA Act Power. In general, the proposed Procedures
provide that the allocation of CVP Power as of November 30, 1993, at a military installation that is closed or approved
for closure under the 1990 Act will be classified as NDA Act Power and will be reserved through November 30, 2003, for
use at that military installation. Until the NDA Act Power is fully utilized at that military installation, the NDA
Act Power will be made available on a temporary basis as described in Section G.1. of the NDA Act Procedures.

3. Western's Consideration of Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) When the application package is received by Western, Western will verify that the general eligibility criteria
set forth in Section E. have been met, and that all items requested in the APD have been provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) Western will request in writing additional information from any applicant whose application package is determined

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (C) If the applicant has met the general eligibility criteria, Western will determine the amount of Power to be allocated
pursuant to the general allocation and contract principles set forth in Section G. Western will send a draft contract
to the applicant for review which identifies the terms and conditions of the offer and the amounts and types of available
Power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) All NDA Act Power shall be allocated according to the procedures set forth in the general allocation and contract
principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) If Western determines that reallocations are necessary to fulfill the applicant's request, Western will initiate
the reallocation procedures set forth in the general allocation and contract principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) In the event that two or more applicants are requesting NDA Act Power and Western does not have enough NDA Act Power
available to meet those requests, Western shall use its discretion to determine the amounts of NDA Act Power to be allocated.
Western shall use information contained in the application package, including, if applicable, the economic development
project plan to make its decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) Western reserves the right to determine the amount of NDA Act Power to allocate to an applicant, as justified by
the applicant in its application package, including, if applicable, the economic development project plan. As loads
increase at a Priority-One Base, the Allottee may request and Western may allocate any amount of NDA Act Power up to
the Priority-One Base's NDA Act Power Entitlement to meet such increase in loads. If necessary, Western may recall
NDA Act Power under the general allocation and contract principles to allocate to the Priority-One Base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. General Allocation and Contract Principles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The general allocation criteria and contract principles established in the Marketing Plan shall apply to Allocations
of NDA Act Power. To meet the specific requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall also apply the following allocation
criteria to all applicants seeking an Allocation of NDA Act Power. All Allocations of NDA Act Power shall be at the sole
discretion of Western and shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocations of NDA Act Power will be made in amounts solely determined by Western, subject to the final NDA Act Procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Allocation Rights: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Western will allocate NDA Act Power to qualified applicants based on the following hierarchy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) First, for a military load at a Priority-One Base, or to qualified Preference Entities promoting economic development
at a Priority-One Base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Such first right to NDA Act Power will be limited to the NDA Act Power Entitlement designated for a Priority-One Base.

such base, to serve a military load or to promote an economic development project; or to a Preference Entity promoting
an economic development project at a Priority-Two Base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NDA Act Power allocated under this paragraph will be subject to recall upon a 3-year written notice in order to fulfill
an Allocation to a Priority-One Base which has not fully utilized its NDA Act Power Entitlement under G.1.(i) above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Third, to a military branch which had a CVP CROD at a Closed Military Installation as of November 30, 1993, for
use at a Priority-Three Base within that military branch within the CVP Marketing Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NDA Act Power allocated under this paragraph will be subject to recall upon a 6-month written notice in order to serve
a Priority-One or Priority-Two Base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Fourth, to any military branch for use at a Priority-Three Base within the CVP Marketing Area, or to a Negatively
Affected Customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NDA Act Power allocated under this subparagraph will be subject to recall upon a 6-month written notice to serve a Priority-One
or Priority-Two Base, or a Priority-Three Base pursuant to G.1.(iii) above.

2. Allocation of NDA Act Power
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western will use the following procedures to allocate NDA Act Power to a qualified applicant: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Western will determine whether sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is available to fulfill the applicant's request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) If sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is available to fulfill the applicant's request, Western shall allocate
the amount needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) If sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is not available to fulfill the applicant's request, Western shall allocate
all Unutilized NDA Act Power and recall and reallocate NDA Act Power CROD to fulfill the request by following the reallocation
procedures stated in G.3. below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) To ensure the most equitable distribution of long-term firm NDA Act and Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power, Western
proposes that each Allocation of NDA Act Power shall be determined as follows:

a Negatively Affected Customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vi) The Allottee has the right to purchase NDA Act Power only when a new electric service contract between Western
and the Allottee has been executed and when all conditions precedent in that contract have been satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vii) To consummate any Allocation of NDA Act Power, an electric service contract shall be executed within 6 months
of a contract offer by Western, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Western.

5. Contract Terms for the Purpose of NDA Act Power
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Long-Term Contracts:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western proposes that Long-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric
service for a period ending by December 31, 2004, and be subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in the final
NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Long-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time of the contract
offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part of the NDA Act
Power CROD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Short-Term Contracts:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western proposes that Short-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric
service during a temporary period ending by December 31, 2004, subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in
the final NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Short-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time
of the contract offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part
of the NDA Act Power CROD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For any applicant requesting NDA Act Power to be used for an economic development project, the point of delivery
for the NDA Act Power must be at the Closed Military Installation where the NDA Act Power will be used, unless otherwise
agreed to by Western.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The minimum Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power CROD shall be 500 kW.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Transmission Service:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All transmission arrangements beyond Western's CVP system are the full responsibility of the Allottee. Western
will assist the Allottee in obtaining third-party transmission arrangements with PG&amp;E for delivery of Power
allocated under the final NDA Act Procedures. Nonetheless, each Allottee is ultimately responsible for obtaining
its own delivery arrangements. Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee is unable to arrange
for the transmission necessary to receive the CROD within 6 months of the execution of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) For those Allottees that receive NDA Act Power to be used at a Closed Military Installation, the following provisions
must be complied with:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee cannot demonstrate that it is using the NDA Act
Power for an economic development project within 1 year of the execution of the contract, unless otherwise agreed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Allottee must provide a report to Western each January 15, which describes the benefits of the NDA Act Power
CROD being passed on to the organization operating the economic development project. This report must be provided
to Western in such a way that Western can separately identify the composite energy and capacity costs stated in mills

(C) Western, at its sole discretion, shall have the right to either withdraw NDA Act Power or terminate its contract
with the Allottee upon 30 days' written notice if the Allottee does not comply with G.5.(vi)(B) above for each year
of the contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Standard Provisions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contracts entered into as a result of the final NDA Act Procedures will incorporate Western's standard provisions
for power sales contracts, resale of electric energy, and conservation and renewable energy in addition to the General
Power Contract Provisions. Western is in the process of developing procedures to require that all long-term firm
customers develop an integrated resource plan consistent with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is anticipated that
these procedures will be effective in late 1994.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., each agency, when required to publish a proposed
rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined that (1) this rulemaking relates to services
offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of the Act, and (2) the impacts of an Allocation from
Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. The requirements of this Act can be waived if the
head of the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. By his execution of this Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, Western's Administrator certifies that no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities will occur.

, and the Department of Energy, 10 CFR &sect;1021, require that the environmental effects of agency decisions be studied
and considered by decision makers. Studies were made to determine whether there were significant impacts to the environment
as a result of the original allocation of this Power to the military installations. These studies and analysis are
published in the Revised Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact which were prepared by Western
for its Sacramento Area Office 1994 Power Marketing Plan. Western is examining the applicability of the 1994 Revised
Environmental Assessment to these Power allocations.

DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators of brass and bronze production facilities must notify EPA of construction, reconstruction,
modification, startup, shutdown, and malfunction of reverberatory and electric furnaces of 1,000 kg or greater
production capacity, and blast furnaces of 250 kg/hr or greater production capacity. Owners or operators must record
all data and calculations and results of initial performance tests and submit that data to EPA. Owners or operators
are also required to maintain records of the occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the
operation of an affected facility, or any period in which the monitoring system is inoperative. Recurring compliance
reports are not required under this standard. EPA uses the data to determine the ability of each plant to comply with
the emission standards.

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This ICR is an extension of an existing collection for Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) planning
requirements in support of the Clean Water Act at paragraph (1) Section 311 (j), and described at 40 CFR 112. The information
will be used by the EPA to ensure that oil spill prevention planning occurs, thereby ensuring compliance with the requirements
of 40 CFR 112.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this ICR, owners or operators of affected facilities must: (1) Prepare the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7),
(2) maintain the plan and appropriate records (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7(e)) if they begin operations or significantly
modify their facilities during the approval period, (3) submit the plan in the event of certain discharges of oil (40
CFR 112.4), (4) revise the plan following modification of the facility (40 CFR 112.5(a)), and (5) conduct a triennial
review of the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPCC plan should describe: (1) possible equipment failures that could lead to a discharge of oil from the facility
(40 CFR 112.7(b)); (2) the use of required preventive measures such as appropriate containment and/or diversion
structures or equipment (40 CFR 112.7(c)), or if containment is not available, an oil spill contingency plan and a
written commitment of manpower, equipment and materials required to expeditiously control and remove any harmful
quantity of oil discharged (40 CFR 112.7(d)); and (3) a discussion of the more detailed planning requirements (40
CFR 112.7(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these general requirements, onshore facilities must maintain records of maintenance and usage of
bypass valves and comparison records on past inspections of aboveground storage tanks. Offshore facilities must
maintain written procedures for inspecting and testing pollution prevention equipment, keep records of well shut-in
valves, prepare written instructions for contractors and subcontractors, and maintain records of inspection of
submarine pipelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there are 450,360 facilities subject to this regulation, with an estimated increase in the regulated universe
of 4,549 facilities per year over the next three years. Facility records related to compliance must be maintained
for three years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Statement: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public reporting burden for new facilities subject to this collection of information is estimated to range between
39.6 and 100.6 hours per response, with an average of 40.5 hours including time for reviewing the Oil Pollution Prevention
regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining data, and preparing and reviewing the
SPCC plan. The annual recordkeeping burden for existing facilities is estimated to range from 5.0 to 13.9 hours per
respondent, with an average recordkeeping burden of 5.5 hours including time for maintaining. reviewing and updating
the SPCC plan.

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is an extension of an existing information collection sponsored by the Office of Water in support of the requirements
set forth by Sections 205(a) and 516(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA requires EPA to conduct a ``needs survey''
every two years as a joint effort of the respondents (States, territories, and the District of Columbia), and EPA's
Office of Water and Regional Offices to gather construction cost estimates and technical data on all existing and
proposed POTWs. The survey results enable EPA, States and Congress to accurately assess construction requirements
and develop allotment formulas for wastewater treatment resource allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents will provide information that includes: 1) updated technical and construction cost information on
municipal wastewater treatment facilities, 2) planning documentation relevant to construction or project costs
of POTWs (capital improvement plans, diagnostics results of needs for construction, etc.), 3) justification of
certain specified categories of need based on construction costs curves, and 4) population anomalies relevant to
POTWs. Respondents will also be asked to provide information related to combined sewer overflows (CSOs), non-point
source and stormwater discharges. The majority of respondents will enter the information using EPA's on-line computerized
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will manage the conduct of the survey, perform quality control and assurance on the needs survey database, and
prepare the final report to Congress using the information provided by the respondents.

 This notice announces the availability of and requests comments regarding the proposed addenda which includes a
draft Data Reporting Guidelines (DRG) for those environmental chemistry methods associated with Subdivision N,
E, and K. This draft DRG is not intended to introduce any new data requirements or revisions into the existing guidelines.
Its purpose is to further clarify technical aspects of the existing Pesticide Assessment Guidelines and to provide
a format for organizing and submitting soil and water methods and their supporting data in order to facilitate their
review. EPA recognizes there are sections of the draft DRG that do not apply to specific soil and water methods; therefore,
registrants should exercise scientific judgement in deciding which sections apply to their methods.

 The draft DRG provides the registrant with a detailed format for submitting soil and water methods to the Agency. Each
method should be complete and meet the technical requirements identified in the DRG. Those methods should be sent
to the Agency to support specific exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects studies during the normal
registration and reregistration cycle. Each study for which environmental chemistry methods are needed has been
clearly identified below. Soil and water methods should be clearly written and capable of being repeated by chemists
in Federal and state laboratories.

This is the ninth addendum to Subdivision N-Environmental Fate (Chemistry) published by the Agency. This new addenda
with the draft DRG has been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and other
organizations within EPA for comment. With this notice EPA plans to make the DRG available to the public for comment
in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires the registration of all pesticides that
are manufactured for use in the United States. In order to obtain a registration from EPA, manufacturers must demonstrate
that their pesticides do not cause any unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. It is now
considered appropriate to provide available soil and water residue methods to EPA because of the increased public
concern regarding the contamination of the environment with pesticides. EPA will validate some of those methods
and may assemble them into a new manual in order to make them available to address potential environmental problems.
This DRG provides more detailed technical guidance regarding those analytical methods and amends Pesticide Assessment
Guideline N, E, and K referred to earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These methods may be validated in an EPA laboratory to determine if they identify and quantify the pesticide parent
compound, toxicologically significant metabolites, and degradates at the level indicated. The results from the
soil and water method validation program may be used to support regulatory decisions regarding the reliability and
validity of the chemistry data sent to the Agency with exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), this Notice announces
EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in swimming pools, hot tubs,
and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32) and Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg.
No. 7124&hyph;93), produced by Alden Leeds, Inc.; and Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33) and Algicil
Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54), produced by N. Jonas Company. EPA is taking this action because it believes that
the use of the products, in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally causes unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. Specifically, EPA is concerned with potential cancer and non-cancer effects
resulting from exposure to simazine in swimming pools. EPA believes that the risks from this particular simazine
use exceed the benefits derived from this use. Effective the date of final cancellation, EPA will not allow further
sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of these products, as described in this Notice. Holders of existing
stocks are subject to FIFRA section 6(g) reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This Notice is divided into 13 units. This unit provides introductory information and describes the legal authority
for this action. Unit II gives the background information on how EPA arrived at its decision to cancel these products.
Unit III summarizes EPA's toxicology concerns. Unit IV outlines the exposure assessment. Unit V discusses EPA's
risk concerns. Unit VI examines the benefits of these products and the impact of this proposed cancellation action.
Unit VII provides the risk/benefit analysis. Unit VIII describes the role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the
Secretary of Agriculture. Unit IX discusses disposition of existing product stocks. Unit X provides the required
notification for possession of canceled products. Unit XI outlines the procedures for implementing the actions
required by this Notice, as well as the procedures for requesting a hearing. Unit XII lists the references to the supporting
documentation. Unit XIII gives information on the public docket.

B. Legal Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product
must be registered by EPA pursuant to FIFRA section 3(a) (7 U.S.C. 136a(a)). A registration is a license allowing a
pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance with use instructions, precautions,
and other terms and conditions of the registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to obtain a registration for a pesticide under FIFRA, an applicant must demonstrate that the pesticide satisfies
the statutory standard for registration, section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5)). That standard requires,
among other things, that the pesticide performs its intended function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment.'' The term ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined under FIFRA section
2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental
costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide'' (7 U.S.C. 136(bb)). This standard requires a finding that the benefits
of the use of the pesticide exceed the risks of use, when the pesticide is used in compliance with the terms and conditions
of registration or in accordance with commonly recognized practices. The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide
product satisfies the statutory criteria for registration is at all times on the proponents of registration, and
continues as long as the registration is in effect

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under FIFRA section 6(b), EPA may issue a notice of intent to cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever
it appears to the Administrator that the product, when used in accordance with widespread and generally recognized
practice, generally causes unreasonable effects (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Registrants and other adversely affected persons may request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified registration
and use. If they do so in a legally effective manner, the registration and use will be continued pending a decision at
the conclusion of an administrative hearing.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, EPA classified simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 1). Simazine is used primarily as an agricultural
herbicide; swimming pool use accounts for less than 2 percent of total simazine usage. In August 1993, EPA conducted
a risk assessment for the swimming pool use (Ref. 2). The risk assessment revealed high potential cancer and non-cancer
health risks to children and adults exposed to water treated with simazine algaecides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of its risk concerns, EPA requested that the 13 registrants of the simazine swimming pool algaecides cease
product formulation and voluntarily cancel their product registrations (Refs. 3 and 4). In response to EPA's request,
nine of the registrants--A &amp; V, Great Lakes Biochemical, Applied Biochemists, Aqua Clear Industries, Western
Purity Biochemical, Poolmaster, Leslie's Pool Supplies, York Chemical, and Quantum Biochemical--requested a
FIFRA section 6(f) voluntary product cancellation. Also, pursuant to FIFRA section 4(i)(5)(D), EPA canceled two
registrations held by EZ-Clor Systems and one held by N. Jonas Company, for failure to pay the annual registration
maintenance fees for those registrations. The cancellation order for the registrations held by these 11 registrants
was published on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18120). A separate order, cancelling the registration of Aladdin Winter Care
(EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17) for failure to pay the annual registration maintenance fee for that product registration,
was signed on May 16, 1994. The order was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and became effective on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27016). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. still hold the following registrations for the following simazine products: Nuclo Dry
Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32), Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;93), Winterizing
Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33), and Algicil Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three registrants of technical simazine--Ciba-Geigy, Drexel Chemical, and Oxon-Italia--are not supporting
the swimming pool simazine use. That is, these manufacturers of the simazine active ingredient do not have their simazine
products registered for swimming pool-related uses. None of Drexel Chemical's products were registered for aquatic
use, and Ciba-Geigy and Oxon-Italia had ceased supporting all aquatic uses before EPA conducted its risk assessment.
The aquatic-use cancellation for Ciba-Geigy, the supplier of technical simazine for the swimming pool products,
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 1, 1992 (57 FR 29309) and became effective on October 9, 1992. The notice of Oxon-Italia's request for aquatic
use cancellations was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6021), and became effective 90 days from that publication date. At EPA's request, Ciba-Geigy
and Oxon-Italia have amended their product labels to explicitly prohibit reformulation of their products into swimming
pool products; Drexel has amended its technical simazine label to prohibit formulation into aquatic-use products.
Because manufacturers of simazine swimming pool products must formulate their products from technical simazine,
the effect of these actions is that there is no legal source of simazine active ingredient from which the swimming pool
product manufacturers may formulate any simazine products.

III. Summary of Toxicological Concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on toxicological studies in laboratory animals, EPA has determined that simazine may pose cancer and non-cancer
risks to individuals exposed to this pesticide. The results of these studies, as well as the EPA classification of
the carcinogenic potential of simazine, are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Carcinogenicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA reviewed the simazine toxicological data base, including rat and mouse chronic feeding/carcinogenicity studies,
in its evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of simazine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rat study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a 2&hyph;year chronic feeding carcinogenicity study, simazine technical was administered in the diet of 340 male
and 340 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (MRID No. 40614405). The study had two phases: a carcinogenicity phase and
a chronic phase. An equal number of male and female rats were randomly divided into four major groups; 50 animals/sex/group
were used in the carcinogenicity phase, and 30 to 40 animals/sex/group were used in the chronic phase. Animals were
dosed at 0 (control), 10, 100, or 1,000 ppm of simazine for 2 years (corresponding to 0.41, 4.17, or 45.77 mg/kg/day
in males; and 0.52, 5.34, or 63.10 mg/kg/day in females). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the carcinogenicity phase, results in the female SD rats indicated that there was a statistically significant
dose-related trend in mammary gland carcinomas, as well as in combined adenomas and carcinomas. The incidence of
mammary gland carcinomas was statistically significantly increased at both the 100 and 1,000 ppm groups, as compared
to the controls. Also, the incidence of combined adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the highest dose tested (HDT) group, as compared to the controls. Mammary gland carcinomas in the main study contributed
to increased mortality in the HDT animals. A higher incidence of mammary gland carcinomas was also seen in the recovery
study (52 weeks of treatment at 1,000 ppm, followed by 52 weeks of recovery) for the control (1/10) and the HDT (4/10)
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of hyperplastic changes (cystic glandular hyperplasia) in the mammary glands of female rats was statistically
significantly higher in the HDT animals than in the controls. This finding correlates with the observed high incidence
of tumors in the HDT group. It is generally understood that the higher tumor incidence correlates directly with a higher
incidence of hyperplastic changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the female rats, the incidence of pituitary carcinomas was found to be statistically significantly higher in the
HDT animals than in the controls. The incidence of pituitary adenomas was found to be extremely high in all groups.
Further statistical analysis of these tumors (total tumor analysis) indicated that the incidence of combined adenomas/carcinomas
in the mid- and high-dose groups was statistically significantly higher than in the controls, and also exhibited
a significant increasing dose-related trend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a statistically significant dose-related trend for the incidence of kidney tubular adenomas in female
rats. However, the tumors occurred only at the HDT, and the incidence was not statistically significant as compared
to the control animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the male SD rats, the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas was very low in all treated and control
groups. The incidence of combined hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the HDT group, as compared to the control group. These incidences fell within the historical control range for this
testing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A very low incidence of kidney tubular adenomas and carcinomas was seen in male rats. A statistically significant
dose-related trend was observed for the incidence of carcinomas, as well as for the incidence of combined adenomas
and carcinomas. However, tumors occurred only at the HDT, and tumor incidences were not statistically significantly
elevated as compared to concurrent controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this study, the Health Effects Division (HED) of the Office of Pesticide Programs Cancer Peer Review Committee
concluded that the highest dose exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for female rats, based on excess deaths
and body-weight-gain reductions. The Committee also agreed that the highest dose in male rats appeared to have exceeded
the MTD, based on a significant decrease in body-weight gain. However, the mid-level dose was well below the MTD, and
mammary gland tumors in the female rat were statistically significantly increased at both the mid- and high-dose
levels. In addition, the Committee concluded that there was too great an interval between the mid (100 ppm) and high
(1,000 ppm) doses. These factors were taken into account in the weight-of-evidence considerations that led the Committee
to classify simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Mouse study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no evidence of a relationship between simazine exposure and carcinogenicity in the mouse. In a 1988 chronic
feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice, simazine technical was administered in the diet to a group of 60 male and 60
female CD1 (ICR) BR mice at 0 (control), 40, 1,000, or 4,000 ppm for 95 weeks (MRID No. 40614404). There were no increases
in neoplasms reported for any dosed group and no evidence of compound-related effect on survival or target organ toxicity.

 Classification of carcinogenic potential.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on the weight-of-evidence, the HED Cancer Peer Review Committee concluded that simazine should be classified
as a Group C possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2). This determination was primarily based on results from the 2&hyph;year
chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats. Based on EPA's evaluation of the data presented in this study, EPA
concluded that technical-grade simazine is carcinogenic in female SD rats, inducing the formation of mammary gland
carcinomas. There is evidence in the published literature that simazine has genotoxic activity, and this was considered
in the weight-of-evidence evaluation of simazine's carcinogenicity classification.

 Rat study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA determined that the 2&hyph;year rat chronic feeding study, described in unit III. A.1. of this notice, was appropriate
for assessing non-cancer risks for ``competitive'' exposure to simazine. A No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) of 0.52
mg/kg/day was established based on decreased body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters that occurred
at 5.34 mg/kg/day. These effects, which include depressed red-blood-cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, are
considered to be reversible when exposure is terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rabbit study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For evaluation of non-cancer risks from ``recreational'' exposure to simazine, EPA based its risk assessment on
the results of a rabbit developmental toxicity study (MRID No. 001611407). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this study, 19 female New Zealand White rabbits per dose level were artificially inseminated and administered
technical grade simazine once daily by gastric intubation at doses of 5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg of body weight.
A significant reduction in mean fetal weight and a significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with skeletal
variations were observed at the 200 mg/kg dose level. Therefore, the developmental NOEL for this study is 75 mg/kg
of body weight. In the mothers, significant decreases in body weight gain, tremors, and abortions were observed in
the mid- and high-dose groups (75 and 200 mg/kg dose levels). The maternal NOEL was therefore established at 5 mg/kg
of body weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Exposure Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA developed four exposure scenarios based on the frequency and duration of exposure (competitive versus recreational
swimming), and on the age and weight of the swimmer (6&hyph;year&hyph;old child versus 35&hyph;year&hyph;old male).
The assessment assumed exposure to the entire body through dermal, oral, buccal and sublingual, orbital and nasal,
aural, and inhalation routes. High-exposure frequency, or ``competitive,'' 6&hyph;year&hyph;old and 35&hyph;year&hyph;old
swimmers are assumed to have daily exposures of 3 and 5 hours, respectively, for 150 days per year (Ref. 5). Based on
these assumptions, EPA estimates that ``competitive'' swimmers are exposed to an Actual Daily Exposure (ADE) of
0.12 mg/kg/day for children, and 0.07 mg/kg/day for adults. Low-exposure frequency, or ``recreational,'' swimmers
of both age groups are assumed to be exposed for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a year. This low exposure results in an ADE of
0.02 mg/kg/day for children and 0.0073 mg/kg/day for adults. EPA assumed that lifetime exposure constitutes 30 years
of exposure over a 75&hyph;year lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Simazine concentrations in swimming pool water were calculated based on label application rates. Although simazine
is soluble to only 3.5 parts per million (ppm) in water at 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, EPA assumed that swimmers could be exposed to average simazine concentrations of 5 ppm, because solubility
could increase at temperatures above 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that it is not necessary to conduct a separate exposure assessment for the simazine product that
is used to control algae in swimming pools during the off-season or winter months. A separate assessment is unnecessary
because the exposure levels for the winter-use (winterizer) product are comparable to the exposure levels for the
non-winterizer simazine swimming pool products. Label application rates for winterizer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-winterizer products are similar. In addition, label directions do not require swimming pools that have been
treated with winterizer products to be drained before they are used by swimmers. Because EPA has no data concerning
simazine dissipation, EPA must assume that following initial or subsequent winterizer treatment, simazine does
not dissipate from swimming pool water. Consequently, swimmers could be exposed to unacceptable levels of simazine
when winterized swimming pools are opened for use. Therefore, EPA believes that the individual risk posed to swimmers
from exposure to simazine used as a winterizer is not significantly different from other exposure scenarios.

, based on mammary gland cancer in laboratory animals. The Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) reviewed the carcinogenicity
of simazine in September 1989 and, while agreeing with the Group C classification, did not recommend the use of a quantitative
risk assessment (Ref. 6). The SAP noted that certain pesticides, such as simazine, may alter endocrine physiology
in the rat and influence the incidence of mammary gland tumors; the SAP therefore recommended that EPA formulate a
position on the regulation of chemicals with this mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a subsequent OPP Cancer Peer Review Committee meeting, the Peer Review Committee evaluated the SAP's recommendation
and concluded that it is appropriate to use the Q

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA measures non-cancer risks by calculating a margin of exposure (MOE), which is a comparison of the NOEL to actual
daily exposure, both of which are expressed in milligrams of chemical dose per kilogram of body weight per day. An MOE
less than 100 generally represents an unacceptable risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-cancer risk to swimmers from high exposure frequency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The high exposure frequency assumed for the competitive swimmer categories necessitated the use of a long-term toxicity
study to calculate non-cancer risk. The 2&hyph;year chronic rat feeding study was therefore used to calculate the
MOEs for competitive swimmers. The risks to swimmers for the non-cancer effects seen in the chronic study--reduction
in body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters (anemia)--are reflected in MOEs of 4.3 for children
and 7.4 for adults. The MOEs for swimmers in the competitive category, based on effects seen in the chronic feeding
study, are well below 100 and therefore indicate an unacceptable risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Non-cancer risk to swimmers from low exposure frequency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA does not consider swimmers exposed at a low exposure frequency (i.e., a few short exposures per year) to be at risk
of exhibiting non-cancer effects (Ref. 8). Because of the low exposure frequency assumed for the recreational swimmer
categories, the rabbit developmental toxicity study was used to calculate MOEs. The effects of reduction in maternal
body weight gain, abortions, and tremors were manifested at very high dose levels and are considered signs of general
systemic toxicity in the test animals. EPA calculated MOEs of 250 for children and 685 for adults exposed to simazine
in swimming pools. This indicates that recreational swimmers are not at risk from the effects seen in the developmental
toxicity study.

VI. Benefits and Impact of Cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under FIFRA, a pesticide registration may only be maintained if the benefits of the use of the pesticide exceed the
risks of use. EPA has found that at least some of the registered alternative algaecides provide comparative control
at comparative prices, during summer season use. EPA has concluded that the benefits associated with Nuclo Dry Granular
Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, and Algicil Plus are negligible when compared to the total operating costs on a
per&hyph;pool basis. The cancellation of these products for summer use will have a negligible impact on the pool industry
and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has also found that the benefits associated with Winterizing Algaecide are relatively small. This information
is based on the fact that there are a number of alternatives to simazine winterizing products on the market, and the
labels of many of these alternative products indicate that they are used at a similar frequency as simazine. Although
EPA has anecdotal information that suggests simazine may have a longer duration of activity, which could, if true,
result in a cost savings, there are no data to support this. Therefore, EPA concludes that the loss of simazine winterizing
products would have only a small impact on the swimming pool industry and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice will not have a significant economic impact in part because
they account for only a small share of the algaecide market for swimming pool use. EPA estimates that all 22 simazine
products account for less than 10 percent of the market for algaecides for swimming pool use. Registrants of 18 of these
products have already requested voluntary cancellation of their registrations, or have had their registrations
canceled for maintenance fee non-payment. The remaining four products subject to this Notice account for less than
1 percent of the total swimming pool algaecide market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact of cancelling these four products is minimized by the availability of registered alternative
algaecides for swimming pool use. Because these alternatives have a substantially greater market share than simazine,
the cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice should not result in significant price increases in the
non-simazine products. For the same reasons, EPA does not expect market dislocations due to the inability to produce
the alternative algaecides to meet demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. indicated to EPA that they have accounted for approximately 25,000 gallons of liquid product
in their possession or in the channels of trade, and 14,000 pounds of unformulated Ciba-Geigy simazine product that
Ciba-Geigy has agreed to buy back. Given the small amount of these products and the over 3 million swimming pools in
the United States that could use simazine pool products, cancellation of these products would have little impact
on the swimming pool industry. Section 6(b) of FIFRA requires EPA to consider the impact of cancellation upon the agricultural
economy (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). EPA has determined that the cancellation of these products will have no impact upon the
agricultural economy because these products are registered for swimming pool use, and not for agricultural uses.

VII. Risk/Benefit Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 6(b) of FIFRA, the Administrator may cancel a pesticide due to unreasonable adverse effects, if the
pesticide generally causes an ``unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social,
and environmental costs and benefits'' of the pesticide's use (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preceding sections of this Notice, the cancer and non- cancer risks to human health from continued
registration of Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, Winterizing Algaecide, and Algicil Plus are
significant, while the benefits of continued registration are negligible for summer use, and are relatively small
for the winterizing use. EPA believes that the risks posed by continued registration are unreasonable when compared
to the benefits, and that simazine use in swimming pools should be canceled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making its determination to propose cancellation, EPA has also examined whether any measures short of cancellation
exist to reduce exposure to acceptable levels, and has concluded that there are none. For the summer use, no measures
could be identified to reduce risk to an acceptable range. For the winterizer use, EPA considered allowing registrants
to retain that use, if data were submitted that showed that superchlorination of pools following simazine use eliminated
the product from treated water. No such data were submitted to EPA. Therefore, EPA has determined that for both the
summer and winter use, there are no acceptable measures short of cancellation.

VIII. Role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA provide certain opportunities for the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and
the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to review and comment upon a draft NOIC, and in the case of USDA,
an analysis of the impact of the proposed action on the agricultural economy. These reviews may be waived, and when
they are, the Notice may be published without delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 5, 1994, EPA asked the SAP and Secretary of USDA to waive their rights to review and comment on this Notice (Refs.
9 and 10). On April 12, 1994, Nancy Ragsdale, Director, National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program,
USDA, notified EPA that the Secretary would waive review of this action (Ref. 11). On May 25, 1994, the SAP notified
EPA that it waived its review of this action (Ref. 12). Because the SAP and USDA have waived their review of this action,
EPA is issuing this Notice without delay.

IX. Disposition of Existing Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of simazine products for use in swimming pools
that were in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to July 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has an established policy for determinations concerning the sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks of
canceled pesticides (56 FR 29362, June 26, 1991). That policy states that in cases where EPA has identified a significant
risk concern and the registration is canceled, EPA will make existing stocks determinations on a case-by-case basis.
In most cases EPA will not permit the continued sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of a canceled product
raising risk concerns unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits exceed the risks. EPA reserves the right to amend
this existing stocks provision, should conditions warrant such amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The swimming pool use of simazine poses unreasonable cancer and non- cancer risk. As discussed in units VI and VII of
this Notice, the benefits of continued sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks are negligible and do not outweigh
the risks. Finally, EPA has taken steps to minimize the amount of stocks that are currently in the hands of registrants,
retailers, and distributors. In December 1993, EPA notified registrants of the risks associated with the products
and asked them to stop formulating, selling, and distributing their products (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that no person may sell, distribute, or use the existing stocks of any product subject to this Notice
except for: (1) Sale or distribution up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of that product,
or (2) for lawful disposal. It is the responsibility of the basic registrants to notify any and all supplementally
registered distributors of their product(s) that this Notice also applies to their supplementally registered products.
Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by their distributors. Any sale, distribution, or use of
existing stocks of canceled products other than as provided in this Notice will be considered a violation of FIFRA
12(a)(2)(J). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, the distribution or sale of canceled products will be allowed
if such distribution or sale is for the purpose of collecting products for relabeling, reformulation, disposal,
or export to a country where the use of simazine is not prohibited, or any other lawful purpose not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Notice. In order for exported existing stocks of canceled simazine to qualify for this exception,
such stocks must comply with all the labeling requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(1)(a) and the foreign purchaser
acknowledgement requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(a)(2). In order to be considered to be in compliance
with these provisions, the exporter must follow the procedures specified in the EPA's Export Policy and Procedures
for Exporting Unregistered Pesticides at 40 CFR part 168, subpart D.

Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g), any producer or exporter, registrant, applicant for a registration, applicant or
holder of an experimental use permit, commercial applicator, or any person who distributes or sells any pesticide,
who possesses any stocks of pesticide products containing simazine subject to this Notice that are canceled by a final
order issued either in the absence of or following a hearing on cancellation (hereafter, referred to as ``affected
persons,'' which includes affected individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, or any organized
group of persons whether incorporated or not) must notify the EPA and appropriate State and local officials of: (1)
Such possession; (2) the quantity of canceled simazine pesticide product possessed; and, (3) the place at which the
canceled simazine pesticide product is stored. Notification by affected persons to EPA and designated State and
local officials pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g) shall be in accordance with the procedures, time frames, and requirements
set out in this Unit. End users, except commercial applicators, are not required to report their stocks of canceled

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 15, 1991 (56 FR 40614), stating that temporary tolerances had been renewed for the combined residues of the
herbicide triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid) and its metabolites 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol
and 2-methoxy-3,5,6-trichloropyridine in or on the raw agricultural commodities rice grain at 0.5 part per million
(ppm) and rice straw at 8.0 ppm, and for triclopyr in poultry meat, poultry fat, and meat byproducts (except kidney)
at 0.2 ppm, poultry kidney at 1.0 ppm and eggs at 0.3 ppm. These tolerances are renewed in response to pesticide petition
(PP) 8G3571, submitted by DowElanco, 9002 Purdue Rd., P.O. Box 681428, Indianapolis, IN 46268. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The company has requested a 1&hyph;year renewal of the temporary tolerances to permit the continued marketing of
the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit
62719-EUP-8, which is being renewed under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended
(Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated,
and it was determined that renewal of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary
tolerances have been renewed on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit
and with the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. DowElanco must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety.
The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available
to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These tolerances expire June 23, 1995. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the above raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on
this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Water soluble packaging (WSP), which usually consists of polyvinyl alcohol, is used to package certain powdered
formulations of pesticides to minimize exposure to pesticide handlers via inhalation. EPA is proposing to streamline
the registration requirements for WSP to encourage use of such ``reduced risk'' packaging. Under the proposed policy,
EPA will register WSP along with other forms of packaging under one registration number under the following conditions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The confidential statement of formula (CSF) must list the chemical name(s), trade name(s), supplier(s), CAS Registry
number(s), and amount(s) of components of the polyvinyl alcohol film and printing ink(s). All WSP components must
have been previously cleared and not listed as ingredients to the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The ``Directions For Use'' on the label must provide mixing directions in terms of WSP packages to be added per unit
volume of water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To add WSP to an existing registration, a registrant would notify EPA by submitting a letter certifying compliance
with the PR Notice, and enclosing two copies of the CSF and one copy of the revised label.

to release.

for making such claims, EPA review and challenges of claims, and effects of CBI claims on information which is not eligible
for confidential treatment by the standards established in TSCA and its implementing regulations, including 40
CFR part 2, on EPA's toxics information mission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After releasing the study, EPA has met with a variety of state, environmental, labor, and industry groups. In addition,
EPA conducted a public meeting regarding the study. EPA carefully considered the recommendations provided in the
study and the comments it has received from the public. Based in part on the recommendations and comments received,
EPA formulated a working paper entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Actions to Reform TSCA Confidential Business Information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (the ``proposal'') discussing the issues raised by EPA, the study, and the various comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency conducted a second public meeting after the release of the proposal. Again EPA has received many comments.
Based on the recommendations and comments received, EPA developed the final paper entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Action Plan: TSCA Confidential Business Information Reform
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The paper is available from the TSCA Hot Line at the location listed under the ADDRESSES unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following are components of the Final Action Plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Educational efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Toxics information dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. State programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Regulatory policy clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CBI review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Industry voluntary information dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Regulatory changes: sunset provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Regulatory changes: senior management official signing CBI claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Regulatory changes: upfront substantiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the comments received in the various stages of the policy development process, various other relevant documents
and the transcripts of the public meetings have been incorporated into a public case file. This case file, No. 00125A,
is available for inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center located at EPA headquarters, Rm. NE&hyph;B607,

of commencement of use) to continue operation with an emergency antenna. An emergency antenna is one that is erected
for temporary use after the authorized main and auxiliary antennas are damaged and cannot be used. The data is used
by FCC staff to ensure that interference is not caused to other existing stations.

On September 30, 1991, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Illinois (Region 13). On June 6, 1994, Region
13 submitted a proposed amendment to its plan that would revise the current channel allotments. Because the proposed
amendment is a major change to the Region 13 plan, the Commission is soliciting comments from the public before taking
action. (See Report and Order, General Docket No. 87&hyph;112, 3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before August 4, 1994 and reply comments on or
before August 19, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554 and should clearly identify them as submission to PR Docket 91&hyph;228 Illinois-Public

<DOCTITLE>Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany; Application to engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Bank), has applied pursuant to  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company
Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage
in various activities through Deutsche Bank Sharps Pixley, Inc. (DBSPI) and Sharps Pixley Brokers, Inc. (``Brokers''),
both of New York, New York, which were acquired indirectly by Deutsche Bank from Kleinwort Benson Group plc, London,
England on December 31, 1993. Deutsche Bank proposes to engage in the following activities through DBSPI: (1) trading
for its own account for nonhedging purposes in gold, silver and platinum bullion in the spot, forward and over-the-counter
(OTC) option markets; and (2) providing various financing services. Deutsche Bank proposes to provide futures commission
merchant (FCM) execution and investment advisory services through Brokers, an FCM registered under the Commodity
Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), on the following contracts: Copper Futures, Options on Copper Futures, Gold Futures, Options on Gold Futures,
Silver Futures, and Options on Silver Futures on the Commodity Exchange, Inc.; Copper Futures, Options on Copper
Futures, Lead Futures, Options on Lead Futures, Zinc Futures, Options on Zinc Futures, Aluminum Futures, Options
on Aluminum Futures, Tin Futures, Options on Tin Futures, Nickel Futures, Options on Nickel Futures, Aluminum Alloy
Futures, and Options on Aluminum Alloy Futures on The London Metal Exchange, Limited. The activities will be conducted
on a world wide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form.

the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank states that the Board previously has determined by Regulation that certain of the proposed activities,
when conducted within limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and
orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(1) and Westpac
Banking Corporation, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 61 (1987) (making, acquiring or servicing loans or other extensions
of credit); 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(18) and (19) (providing FCM transactional and advisory services with respect to
bullion contracts). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank also maintains that the Board has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities,
when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking.

commodity contracts). Deutsche Bank maintains that DBSPI and Brokers would conduct these previously approved activities
in conformity with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank further states that the Board previously has not approved trading platinum bullion in the spot market
for a bank holding company's own account, or trading gold, silver or platinum bullion in the forward or OTC option market
for a bank holding company's own account for nonhedging purposes. With respect to trading gold and silver in the forward
and OTC option markets, Deutsche Bank maintains that the Board previously has determined that trading for nonhedging
purposes in the proposed derivative contracts with respect to other bank-eligible investments is closely related
to banking, and, therefore, that trading these contracts with respect to silver and gold bullion also is closely related
to banking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to its proposal that Company trade for its own account in platinum bullion, Deutsche Bank states that
the OCC and the New York State Banking Department have approved this activity for banks under their respective jurisdictions.
Deutsche Bank also states that the Board has approved under  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act the purchase and sale of platinum
coins, under limited circumstances.

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 552 (1990). Deutsche Bank maintains that for these reasons, the proposed trading in
platinum bullion is closely related to banking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by DBSPI and
Brokers ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Deutsche Bank maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Deutsche Bank to offer
its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Deutsche Bank states that the proposed activities will not
result in the adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts
of interest, or unsound banking practices.

In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice

and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than July 31, 1994. Any request for a

The company listed in this notice has filed an application under  225.23(a)(1) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(1))
for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a)
of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to commence or to engage

Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably

that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, Marion
Merrell Dow to license its dicyclomine formulations and production technology to a third party, and to contract manufacture
dicyclomine for the third party while that party awaits the Food and Drug Administration approval to sell its own dicyclomine.
The consent agreement also would prohibit future acquisition of any dicyclomine manufacturing, production or distribution
capabilities without prior Commission approval.

The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission''), having initiated an investigation of the Acquisition of certain
stock of Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby'') by Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (``MMD''), a subsidiary of The
Dow Chemical Company (``Dow'') (collectively referred to as ``Proposed Respondents''), and it now appearing that
Proposed Respondents are willing to enter into an Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Agreement'') to license
certain assets, contract manufacture dicyclomine tablets and capsules, cease and desist from certain acts, and
provide for certain other relief:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby agreed by and between Proposed Respondents, by their duly authorized officers and their attorneys, and
counsel for the Commission that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Proposed Respondents waive:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any claims under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the Proposed
Respondents, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the Proposed Respondents
that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the
draft complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's rules, the Commission
may, without further notice to Proposed Respondents, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to license and to cease and
desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the
Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the
same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States
Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to Proposed Respondents' addressed
as stated in this agreement shall constitute service. Proposed Respondents waive any right they may have to any other
manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding,
representation, or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Proposed Respondents have read the proposed Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed Respondents understand
that once the Order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing they have fully
complied with the Order. Proposed Respondents further understand that they may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

employees of MMD and training at the Potential New Entrant's facility for a period of time sufficient to satisfy the
Potential New Entrant's management that its personnel are appropriately trained in the manufacture of dicyclomine
tablets and capsules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. While the obligations imposed by Paragraphs II.A, II.D or Paragraph III of this Order are in effect, Respondents
shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain the viability and marketability of the Rugby intangible dicyclomine
assets and the tangible assets needed to contract manufacture and sell dicyclomine tablets and capsules and to prevent
the destruction, removal, wasting, deterioration or impairment of any of the Rugby intangible and tangible assets
relating to the manufacture of dicyclomine tablets and capsules except in the ordinary course of business and except
for ordinary wear and tear that does not affect the viability and marketability of the Rugby intangible and tangible
assets.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from The Dow Chemical Company (``Dow'') and Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (``MMD''), a subsidiary of Dow, under which
MMD would be required to manufacture and supply the drug dicyclomine for a potential new entrant and to provide the
dicyclomine formulation and other intangible assets to expedite that potential new entrant's entry as a manufacturer
into the dicyclomine market. In addition, under the proposed Consent Order the potential new entrant would be required
to certify its good faith intention to manufacture dicyclomine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 4, 1993, MMD and Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby'') signed an agreement whereby MMD acquired
all of the stock of Rugby's generic pharmaceutical business. The proposed compliant alleges that the acquisition
violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45,
in the market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by establishing a new entrant into the U.S. market for
dicyclomine capsules and tablets to replace the competition lost as a result of the acquisition. The proposed Consent
Order would require MMD to enter into an agreement with a potential new entrant within twelve (12) months from the date
the proposed Consent Order becomes final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agreement would require MMD to manufacture and supply dicyclomine, as well as to license the relevant dicyclomine
technology, to a Commission approved potential new entrant. MMD must continue to supply the potential new entrant
with dicyclomine until the potential new entrant has begun manufacturing dicyclomine with FDA approval, or for seven
(7) years, whichever is shorter. The price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential new entrant
may not exceed 48 percent of the Average Wholesale Price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993. The potential new entrant
must certify its good faith intention and actual plan to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine capsules
and tablets for sale in the U.S. In the event that MMD fails to enter into such an agreement with a potential new entrant,
or that the potential new entrant discontinues or fails in its efforts to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine
within seven (7) years, the proposed Consent Order provides that MMD shall consent to the appointment of a trustee
by the Commission. The trustee will be responsible for locating a potential new entrant that will obtain the necessary
approvals and sell dicyclomine into the U.S. market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Order will also prohibit for a period of ten (10) years, Dow and MMD from acquiring any interest in assets
used for the development, manufacture or sale of dicyclomine without prior approval from the Commission. The proposed
Order will also require MMD to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the provisions of the Order
within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until the
Commission has approved a potential new entrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Dow and MMD will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Dow
or MMD to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Dow or MMD resulting
in the emergence of a successor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Today, the Commission accepts for comment a consent agreement settling charges that Marion Merrell Dow's consummated
acquisition of certain stock in the Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. would substantially lessen competition in
the United States market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets. I support the allegations in the complaint
that the acquisition created a monopoly in the manufacture and sale of dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets,
and I have reason to believe the acquisition violated the law. I dissent because I find the remedy insufficient. Ideally,
the Commission would have sought to enjoin the transaction. Although it did not seek a preliminary injunction, the
Commission still should seek through administrative litigation divestiture of assets sufficient to create a viable,
independent dicyclomine business. Administrative litigation takes time but affords a much higher likelihood of
obtaining effective relief by divestiture of an ongoing enterprise than does a technology license designed to induce
new entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order requires Marion Merrell Dow to grant a nonexclusive license to certain intangible dicyclomine assets,
including patents and technology, and for up to seven years to sell to the person acquiring the license dicyclomine
tablets and capsules at a price not exceeding 48 percent of the average wholesale price on July 2, 1993. Technology
licenses tend to be highly regulatory and less effective than divestitures in restoring competition. Further, because
of the great difficulty government agencies have in specifying competitive market prices, it is highly questionable
whether requiring sales of dicyclomine at a Commission-specified maximum price will provide consumers with interim
relief from the monopoly. Indeed, since the Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting
period on July 12, 1993, it seems entirely possible that the price on July 2 reflected the impending merger to monopoly
and was already supra-competitive.

The Commission is accepting for public comment a proposed consent agreement with Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (``MMD''),
the manufacturer of Bentyl, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders.
In October 1993, MMD acquired Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby''), a manufacturer of numerous pharmaceutical
products, including a generic version of Bentyl: dicyclomine hydrochloride. The proposed complaint alleges, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that this acquisition ``created a monopoly in the manufacture of dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets.''
Complaint &para;&sect;VIII(c). I am writing separately in order to explain one aspect of my analysis of this case,
and to raise some questions concerning the proposed remedy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A threshold issue in analyzing this merger is whether MMD's Bentyl and Rugby's generic dicyclomine are in the same
product market. On the one hand, it may seem obvious that two drugs deemed to be bio-equivalent by the Food and Drug Administration,
must be in the same relevant product market. On the other hand, branded drugs and their generic counterparts typically
vary dramatically in price, suggesting that consumers may not view the products as equivalent or interchangeable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Merger Guidelines, the Commission approaches the issue of market definition by asking what products,
if any, constrained the price of MMD's Bentyl (and Rugby's generic dicyclomine) at the time of the merger. If, in response
to a small but significant increase in the price of Bentyl, enough customers would switch to generic dicyclomine (or,
if in response to a small but significant increase in the price of generic dicyclomine, enough customers would switch
to Bentyl) to make the price increase unprofitable, then the two products are deemed to be in the same market. Whether
a particular branded drug and any generic versions are in the same market may vary over time, and depends in part upon
their relative prices at the time of the merger. In general, where the price differential between the branded product
and the generic product is great, the products are more likely to be in separate markets.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Conversely, where the price gap between the branded product and the generic product is relatively small (for example,
where there is only one generic version available to consumers), the products are more likely to be in the same market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This price differential may be greatest where there is intense price competition among different generic versions
of a drug. In this situation, the branded drug may not serve as a significant constraint on the price of the generic versions;
that is, a five or ten percent increase in the (very low) price of the generic drugs would not be defeated by sales lost
to the (much higher priced) branded drug. And in this situation, the next best substitute for the branded drug (from
the perspective of those consumers who are uninterested in low priced generics) may be another branded drug. Under
the Merger Guidelines, the branded and generic drugs may then be viewed as occupying separate product markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed consent agreement aims to establish a new competitor in the U.S. dicyclomine market to replace the competition
lost as a result of MMD's allegedly illegal acquisition. Specifically, MMD is required to license certain dicyclomine
production technology to a Commission-approved licensee that avows a good faith intention to obtain FDA approval
to independently manufacture dicyclomine for sale in the United States. Further, MMD must supply dicyclomine to
the potential new entrant for up to seven years, until such time as the licensee has begun manufacturing dicyclomine
on its own.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I am concerned about the terms of this Commission-mandated supply agreement. The proposed consent order provides
that the price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential entrant may not exceed 48 percent of
the average wholesale price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 This is in effect a form of government price regulation, and is apt to result in a significant misallocation of resources.
It is particularly troubling that the maximum transfer price is fixed by the Commission's order for up to seven years,
and (unlike market-based prices) does not vary with either changes in demand or changes in the costs of production.
If the costs of production come to exceed the transfer price, then the licensee may have an incentive to delay the opening
of its own production facility, and hence delay the return of true, market-based competition.

My view, based upon the evidence assembled during this investigation, is that the July 2, 1993 price did not reflect
the exercise of any market power gained as a result of the then impending MMD/Rugby transaction, but reflected other
factors.

Furthermore, the fixed transfer price may actually be in effect for longer than seven years. For example, if the original
licensee fails after seven years to obtain FDA approval, then a replacement licensee may be selected by a trustee.
This second licensee is entitled to purchase dicyclomine from MMD at the same fixed price. Given the Commission's
recent experience in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Docket No. 9228) matters, the prospect of another seemingly interminable and complicated compliance proceeding
disturbs me. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I hope that during the public comment period the Commission will receive advice on the wisdom and workability of the
proposed supply agreement. In particular, I am interested in considering alternate ways of structuring the price
term. Is there a practical way, under a revised order, to permit the price term to vary should the costs of production
or demand vary?
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Or would the uncertainties of future cost and demand changes be better accomodated if MMD and the licensee were free
to negotiate a price term (perhaps subject to Commission approval)? Finally, what is the optimal duration for the
supply agreement? Specifically, how long should it take a licensee, acting diligently, to obtain required FDA approvals
and commence manufacturing dicyclomine? At this time, I am not confident that the appropriate maximum duration for
the MMD supply agreement should be as long as seven years. Public comment on these issues may be of significant value
to the Commission not only in this matter, but more generally as the agency seeks to devise effective antitrust remedies
for the pharmaceutical, and other industries.

I voted to accept for public comment the proposed consent agreement in this matter because I believe it represents
a viable solution to the potential anticompetitive effects that resulted from Marion Merrell Dow's (``MMD'') acquisition
of Rugby Holding, Inc. (``Rugby''). The acquisition created a monopoly in the market for dicyclomine tablets and
capsules by combining the only two manufacturers of the branded and generic product. The proposed consent has the
potential of establishing a second competitor through the grant of a nonexclusive license by MMD of certain intangible
dicyclomine assets. The order also sets a maximum price at which MMD is allowed to sell dicyclomine tablets and capsules
to the licensee for up to seven years. The goal is to replace the competition lost from the dicyclomine market as quickly
as possible by establishing a new entrant in the market. The order is the best mechanism to provide quick relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order sets a ceiling of 48% of the average wholesale price on July 2, 1993, as the maximum price at which MMD is allowed
to sell dicyclomine tablet and capsules to the licensee. The July 2, 1993, wholesale price offers the best available
approximation of the price that would exist in a market consisting of only one manufacturer of the branded and one manufacturer
of the generic product. The 48% is based on our best approximation of the margin that a generic distributor of another
manufacturer's product needs to make a profit. Furthermore, the July 2 price is the firs price increase that reflected
the exit of two generic competitors. The timing of the merger announcement and the price increase could suggest that
the price on July 2nd were also influenced by the impending merger; however there is no evidence of this. If the ceiling
is higher than one would prefer, the licensee and licensor could conceivably arrive at a transfer price that somewhat
reduces their incentives to fully compete. Unfortunately, there is no other non-arbitrary method for setting the
maximum allowable price, nor would it be easy to determine such a price. The provision, however, does serve the basic
purpose of providing the licensee a chance to succeed without injecting a regulator's version of competition into
the market.

I think indexing for inflation might have been more appropriate given the seven year period over which the ceiling
would be in effect.

I have a mild concern that the licensee will not have sufficient incentives to begin manufacturing dicyclomine on
its own under the order. A potential licensee could enter the licensing agreement for a short period of time with the
intention of taking advantage of the profit available for selling the licensed product but without the intention
of manufacturing dicyclomine on its own. Alternatively, a licensee might initially intend to elf-manufacture,
but change its strategy at some later date and sell only the licensed product.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In this particular instance, no reasonable fixes to the licensee incentive problem seem available. Therefore, on
balance, I support the order because, at a minimum, it should achieve the necessary intermediate relief. Permanent
relief, such as divestiture, may not be as needed in this instance because there is a good possibility of future entry,
albeit untimely.

of R.H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. Proposed respondents operate department stores in New York, California, and a number
of other states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that the proposed respondents have violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission
(16 CFR 702.3(a)) pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. 2301). This Rule requires the proposed
respondents to make manufacturers' warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the
Rule, are to improve the information available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in
the marketing of consumer product warranties offered by manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either (1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or (2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that the proposed respondents have not complied with either of these options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to comply with this Rule, to inform their retail store executives
of their compliance responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing their sales personnel about the availability
and location of manufacturers' warranty information. Proposed respondents will be subject to civil penalties if
they do not comply with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois (``Wards''). Wards is a national chain of retail department stores, and of specialty
stores selling appliances and consumer electronics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that Wards has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a))
pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;2301). This Rule requires Wards to maker manufacturers'
warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information
available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties
offered by manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either 1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or 2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that Wards has not complied with either of these options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires Wards to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance
responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location
of manufacturers' warranty information. Wards will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,
Hoffman Estates, Illinois (``Sears''). Sears is a national chain of retail department stores. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that Sears has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a))
pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;2301). This Rule requires Sears to make manufacturers'
warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information
available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties
offered by manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either (1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or (2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that Sears has not complied with either of these options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires Sears to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance
responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location
of manufacturers' warranty information. Sears will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Services Administration proposes to acquire a site and develop a new U.S. Courthouse consisting of approximately
800,000 gross square feet. The new facility will consolidate the district court and court-related agencies which
are currently housed in six different Government-owned and leased locations. Although the proposed building will
initially accommodate the projected 10-year space requirements of the courts, the site to be acquired will be of sufficient
size to allow for its expansion beyond that timeframe.

The existing U.S. Courthouse in Cleveland was constructed in 1910 and is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. It contains a gross area of approximately 250,000 square feet and currently houses the district court, the
bankruptcy court and the U.S. court of appeals. Due to the significant expansion of the recent years, several court-related
tenants have been relocated into approximately 127,000 square feet of leased space. The proposed new courthouse
will, with the exception of two senior district judges, consolidate the entire direct court family and related agencies
in one building. The existing U.S. Courthouse will be retained, and will house two senior district judges and the bankruptcy
court. The EIS will evaluate alternative sites for the proposed facility, as well as the no-build alternative. The
EIS will also evaluate impacts on the affected environment for resource areas including geology and soils, air and
noise quality, cultural resources, land us, community services, traffic and transportation, hazardous materials,
economics and aesthetics

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Infectious Diseases, announces the opportunity
for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the further
development, refinement, and validation of three interrelated technologies: (1) The Exchangeable Template Reaction
(ETR), a method to assemble synthetic genes, (2) the construction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) specific ``mosaic''
proteins composed of immunodominant antigenic epitopes, and (3) differential HCV diagnostic tests. It is anticipated
that these and any new technologies or inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be licensed to the collaborator
with whom the CRADA is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful,
marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research.
The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may
provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange:
CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication
of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds
this necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The goal of this CRADA is to bring to market HCV-specific technologies that will improve public health. CDC will provide
intellectual insight and experimental design protocols to: (1) Improve the efficiency of ETR, (2) construct ``mosaic''
proteins for HCV that have immunodiagnostic and potential vaccine relevance, and (3) evaluate synthetic peptides
containing antigenic epitopes as reagents to discriminate recent from late infections or that may predict outcome
of HCV infection. CDC will design and conduct feasibility experiments for each of the project areas and will contribute
in the preparation of serologic panels to validate various test formats. The CRADA partner will prepare all synthetic
peptides and oligonucleotides as necessary for each project area, prepare monospecific and monoclonal antibodies
whenever appropriate, and purify antigens from recombinant lysates as needed. The collaborator will utilize its
expertise in market research to evaluate the commercialization of the technologies.

Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $250,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund three cooperative agreements. It is expected that the
awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period
of up to five years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to develop data collection networks and to provide information about
the practice of laboratory medicine in hospital, physician office and independent laboratories. This cooperative
agreement will ultimately improve patient care by improving the quality of clinical laboratory medicine and increase
the availability of laboratory monitoring networks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipients will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for those activities under B. (CDC Activities). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Recipient Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Solicit laboratories to voluntarily participate in the Monitoring Networks so that sufficient representatives
of each laboratory type (hospital, physician office, and independent) participate in the total network by the end
of the first year of operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide leadership in the design and evaluation of questionnaires for periodic reporting of laboratory operational
characteristics and problems, especially those that impact patient care and on methods that are used by the network
participants during the period of the study. Topics investigated by the questionnaires and the time period of monitoring
may change during the cooperative agreement by mutual consent of both network participants and CDC. The actual monitoring
areas will be decided after the award of the cooperative agreement(s) and may differ for each of the laboratory groups.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questionnaires should also capture information that determines the effectiveness of actions being taken by
participants to improve the practice of laboratory medicine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Provide leadership in collecting and sharing raw data both within the network and with CDC. Participant identification
information may be omitted from these data sets if the network manager(s) is able to respond to questions concerning
the validity of entered data without providing participant identification information.

Purpose
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: The purpose of this open meeting is to review and discuss a NIOSH project entitled, ``Control of Occupational Exposures
during Construction.'' Peer reviewers will give their individual review comments and suggestions regarding the
scope of the study. Historically, many exposures related to construction have gone unquantified and uncontrolled.
The objective of this project is to provide the construction industry with information concerning practical, effective
engineering controls and work methods which minimize worker exposures to process-generated air contaminants.
The initial phases of this project will focus on drywall sanding and roofing kettles. Viewpoints and suggestions
from industry, labor, academia, other government agencies, and the public are invited.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grant application process for FY 1994 will consist of a one-stage, full application. Applications are limited
to 20 single- or 40 double-spaced pages (excluding resumes, forms, etc.) and must relate to the selection criteria
established for review of applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority areas in this announcement permit applicants to propose research efforts from 12 to 24 months in duration.
In item 11 of the Face Sheet (page 1 of form SSA&hyph;96&hyph;BK) indicate the priority area under which the application
is submitted, i.e., ORS&hyph;94&hyph;001, ORS&hyph;94&hyph;002, etc.

Part II. Priority Research Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, the following projects will be considered for funding: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Economic Circumstances of Aged Widows_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;001 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A high proportion of the elderly who are economically vulnerable are widowed women. Although as a group they experience
one of the highest rates of poverty, approximately three-quarters of widows aged 65 or older are not poor. Data from
the SIPP provide an opportunity to understand the economic circumstances of aged widows and to identify those factors
that are associated with their late-life poverty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals are sought for SIPP-based research that conducts two types of analyses of the poverty of aged widows. The
first of these tasks is to provide a comprehensive description of the personal, financial, and environmental characteristics
of poor elderly widows. These characteristics will include details of income amounts and specific sources, assets,
personal and household characteristics (e.g., age, race, education, work history, fertility history, welfare
recipiency history, health status, urban vs rural location, age at which widowhood occurred). This descriptive
material should compare and contrast the incidence of poverty and its circumstances for aged widows with similar
measures for single elderly women who have never married, aged married women, and, where sample size permits, elderly
divorced women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second task is to simulate the resulting economic scenario for married women aged 65 or older in the event of the
death of their husbands. This will involve projecting the time path of income and assets for the widow, given the couple's
economic circumstances at time of the SIPP interviews. The hypothetical widow's income should be based on Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income program rules, any pension income she has earned in her own right, whether
a husband with public or private pension rights has elected a survivor's option, asset income, the couple's life insurance
holdings, and so forth. It is expected that, where possible, the economic status of the couple prior to the husband's
death will be related to factors such as lifetime work experience of each spouse, current health status and health
insurance coverage, etc. In addition, various scenarios for asset decumulation associated with health expenditures
brought on by the husband's death might be introduced to account for reduced assets subsequently available to the
surviving spouse [See Linda Del Bene and Denton R. Vaughan, ``Income, Assets and Health Insurance: Economic Resources
for Meeting Acute Health Care Needs of the Aged,'' Social Security Bulletin, Spring 1992]. We are interested in learning
how the economic status of aged widows compares with their circumstances prior to the husband's death, whether particular
background factors can be used to predict which married women are particularly at risk of poverty in their old age,
and how the incomes and assets of widows change as the duration of widowhood increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year
funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that an amount up to $100,000 will be allocated to fund one project under this priority area for the
initial 12-month budget period.

B. Selected Economic and Demographic Assumptions Used to Project the Financial Status of the OASDI Trust Funds_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;002

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal OASDI Trust Funds contain long-range, 75-year projections
on the financial status of the trust funds. The assumptions and methodology underlying those projections were reviewed
by the Panel of Technical Experts (the Panel) convened by the quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security and
recommendations for research were made. (The ``Social Security Technical Panel Report to the 1991 Advisory Council
on Social Security'' and its appendices were reprinted in the November and December 1990 issues of the Social Security
Bulletin.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address some of the Panel's recommendations for research, the principal topics of this priority are to better understand:
(i) the determinants of changes in productivity and earnings, and how to develop better methods of projecting future
productivity and earnings; (ii) the determinants of nominal and real interest rates and of how to project them; (iii)
the determinants of fertility and how to project future fertility rates; (iv) the determinants of mortality and how
to project future mortality rates; (v) the analysis of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
illegal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 immigration and how to project such immigration; and (vi) the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost
projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on productivity and earnings are: What are the determinants of linkages between
productivity and earnings, particularly hours of work and fringe benefits? What are the effects of the changing quality
(including the question of measuring quality) and demographic mix of the labor force? What are the effects of research
and development by both the public and the private sectors? What are the effects of capital formation by the public
sector (e.g., public infrastructure) and by the private sector? What is the effect of the increasing integration
of U.S. and foreign markets? Are there analytical methods or strategies for selecting which averaging periods are
most appropriate in determining the various economic assumptions? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between
productivity and earnings and other economic and demographic factors? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on nominal and real interest rates are: To what extent can the current structure
of interest rates be used to predict future interest rates? What are the determinants of inflation and are there analytical
methods for projecting future inflation rates? What strategies are optimal for incorporating both historical and
current interest rate information into the projections? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between nominal
and real interest rates and other economic and demographic variables? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on fertility patterns in this priority area are: What are the determinants of fertility
and changes in fertility? What is the relationship between age at first birth and the total fertility rate? How do birth
rates of immigrants and of their children compare with those of non-immigrants and their children? Will future trends
in fertility rates by race and ethnic group mirror past trends? For assumptions used in projecting fertility, can
an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how much
weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among those questions to be addressed on mortality are: What are the determinants of mortality and rates of change
in mortality? What evidence is there for projecting changes in mortality for specific causes (e.g., cancer, heart,
etc.) based on changes in smoking, nutrition, and other lifestyle patterns? For assumptions used in projecting mortality,
can an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how
much weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Among the questions to be addressed on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
illegal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
immigrants are: Estimates of current numbers, labor-force participation rates, and rates of immigration of illegal
immigrants; analysis of factors likely to affect future immigration rates of illegal immigrants and projections
based on this analysis; the length of coverage and average earnings of illegal immigrants and the length of time they
remain in the country; and the extent to which illegal immigrants receive benefits based upon their coverage under
the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be asked with respect to the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost projections
are: Although theoretically, the current low-cost and high-cost projections represent a collection of extreme
values for each of the variables, how should these bounds be interpreted_as absolute bounds on what could possibly
happen, as confidence levels, as illustrative alternative projections, or as sensitivity analyses? (Attention
should be given to the way in which rates of inflation are incorporated into the low-cost and high-cost projections.)
Should the projections incorporate interrelationships among the economic and demographic variables (for example,
among others, interactions among fertility, marital status, labor force participation, and birth expectations),
and if so, which interrelationships are critical, and how should they be incorporated?

C. Issues Related to the Scheduled Increase in the Retirement Age_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98&hyph;21) provide for a gradual increase in the age at which unreduced
retired-workers benefits are first payable (for brevity, the retirement age) from 65 to 67 between the years 2000
and 2027. Benefits for retired workers still will be available at age 62, but the amount payable will be gradually reduced
from the currently payable 80 percent of the unreduced benefit to 70 percent. It has further been proposed to speed
up the phase-in to a higher retirement age, and to increase the retirement age to 68 (70 in one proposal). At least one
proposal also increases the early retirement age to 65. (The executive summary of the report mandated by Congress
and consultant reports were reprinted in the October 1986 and February 1987 issues of the Social Security Bulletin.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The increase in retirement age is based on the assumption that the increase in life expectancy has been accompanied
by a corresponding improvement in health and capacity to work. But past studies are inconclusive about the relationship
between longevity and work ability, especially among persons in their sixties. Proposals are sought to further investigate
these relationships, using either new approaches, more current data, and/or new databases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One possible approach would be to use microdata collected by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine
trends in health and ability to work. Data should be presented for subgroups of major interest for the retirement age
issue (both early and normal retirement), subject to sampling error problems. A wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of variables that measure health and ability to work should be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The retirement-age increase may also impact on the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. Studies
are needed to address questions such as: (i) what is the expected impact on the number of DI beneficiaries and their
duration on the rolls and on the DI Trust Fund; (ii) how many workers would qualify for DI benefits at age 65 and 66 and
how many would elect to receive benefits; and (iii) among those aged 62&hyph;64 who do not now elect to apply for DI benefits,
how many might do so because of the additional reduction in benefits for early retirement that accompanies a retirement-age
increase (including the elimination in some proposals of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
early
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 benefits for workers aged 62&hyph;64)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding
not to exceed 17 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application
is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for up to 17 months under this priority
area.

D. Analyses of the New Beneficiary Data System_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;004 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This project is intended to encourage research with the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS) developed by SSA over the
past decade to study the changing circumstances of aged and disabled beneficiaries. Based initially on a survey of
new beneficiaries at the beginning of the 1980's, the dataset has been expanded with information from administrative
records (on benefits, covered earnings, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicare) and followup interviews with
survivors from the original survey. With the exception of the Medicare records, all administrative data have been
obtained both for respondents and spouses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original sample contained representative samples of new Social Security beneficiaries who filed for benefits
as retired workers, disabled workers, wives, widows, divorced wives, and surviving divorced wives. There was also
a representative sample of persons aged 65 and over who were entitled to Medicare benefits but who had not yet received
Social Security cash benefits. The aged sample was, for the most part, in its mid- to late-60's in 1982 and in its mid-
to late-70's in 1991. Some of the sample members were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the ``notch'' that was created when legislation was enacted to correct for an overcompensation in the
benefit formula for inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original interview covered a wide range of topics, including demographic characteristics, marital and childbearing
history, employment history, current income (in the format of the SIPP) and assets, and health. The followup interview,
in addition to asking many of the same questions as the original interview, collected a history of critical events
since 1982 (such as widowhood or divorce, work cessation, migration, and the sale of the home) and the financial impact
of these critical events. The original health items of work disability, functional capacity, and presence of major
diseases were expanded to assess specific Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living,
private health insurance provisions, and the longest experience in a long-term care facility. Disabled workers
who returned to work were asked about their job search experience, employer accommodations to their disability,
and their use of vocational and rehabilitation services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background material and a compilation of reports based on the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey are available. These reports
were also published in various editions of the Social Security Bulletin from 1983 to 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the NBDS, the following projects will be considered for funding: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Understanding How Aged Beneficiaries Become Poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although poverty rates among the aged have declined substantially over the last 30 years, there are still some troublesome
problems and poverty among aged women is a particular concern. Various legislative proposals have been made or discussed
to improve the treatment of women under the Social Security program, including care-giving credits, increasing
benefits at some age, eliminating the actuarial reduction for early benefit receipt at some age, modifying the Social
Security special minimum benefit, and redesigning couple benefits in order to enhance survivor benefits. However,
many of the proposals are not well targeted to the poor. Proposals for research are sought to increase our understanding
of why aged beneficiaries, and especially aged women, become poor, which will improve our ability to form policy in
this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the key research questions are: To what extent is aged poverty a continuation of a lifetime of low income? To
what extent is aged poverty a result of aged couples decumulating assets as they age? What are the economic effects
of widowhood, including the extent to which sources of income are lost or reduced, and the extent to which high health
care expenditures surrounding the death of a spouse are a major cause of high poverty rates among the aged who have become
widowed? Is the type of social security benefit received (retired worker benefits, wife or widow benefits, worker
benefits that are supplemented because of entitlement to a higher spouse or survivor benefit and those that are not,
retirement benefits that were converted from a disability benefit at age 65 and those that were not) related to differing
poverty rates in 1982, and are those patterns the same among beneficiaries 10 years later? How different is the role
of major sources of income (including social security, other pensions, asset income, earnings, and Supplemental
Security Income_an SSA-administered ``safety net'' program) in 1991 than it was in 1982? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Changing Economic Status of Individuals With Disabilities and Their Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We know that newly disabled individuals in 1982 were less well-off than newly retired individuals in terms of both
income and assets. However, little or no research has been done to follow disabled individuals over time to determine
whether they have particular problems maintaining an adequate standard of living. The well-being of many individuals
with disabilities depends not only on their own income but also on the income and/or services provided by family members,
such as the earnings of spouses, or help with activities of daily living that may mean the difference between living
in the community and having to be institutionalized.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the questions to be addressed are: How adequate are the income and assets of individuals with disabilities just
after benefit receipt and 10 years later? To what extent do disabled individuals maintain their economic status over
this period of time? What factors are associated with changes in economic status over the period? How do family members
affect the economic status of disabled workers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analyses should include background factors (such as demographic characteristics, previous occupational characteristics
and earnings, living arrangements, family characteristics, and health conditions), major changes in life circumstances
(such as widowhood or divorce, changes in living arrangements, or a spouse changing hours of work or retiring), sources
of income, changes in the health status, and health-care costs and how these factors relate to various economic outcomes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals should identify the expected methods of analysis, the possible variables to be considered, and the logic
for inclusion. Application may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for the initial 12-month budget
period under this priority area.

E. Documenting and Explaining SIPP-CPS Differences in Aged Poverty Rates_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;005 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The official poverty measure and its three derivative statistics (poverty counts, poverty rates and poverty gaps)
are important and frequently used criteria employed in the formulation of policy and the evaluation of program outcomes
for the aged and disabled populations served by SSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve-month poverty rates based on the SIPP are somewhat lower for many population subgroups than the poverty rates
estimated from the CPS. Much of the comparison of poverty rates from the two surveys has been based on the first operational
SIPP panel (the 1984 panel) which pertained to the 1983&hyph;85 time period. In the 1984 panel context, SIPP-CPS poverty
rate differences for the aged, were, if anything, less marked than for younger age groups. Based on a review of published
poverty rate estimates based on SIPP panels for 1985&hyph;1990 and comparison to corresponding estimates based
on the CPS, it appears that a significant change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates appeared with
the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel. Key features of the change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty
rates include: 1) a modest decline in the poverty rate for all ages in the SIPP relative to the CPS; 2) a much more marked
SIPP-CPS difference in poverty rates for the aged than the nonaged (with SIPP rates for the aged ranging between 28
and 34 percent below those based on the CPS); 3) a marked attenuation of the tendency for poverty rates to increase strongly
with age among those age 65 and older in the SIPP context as compared with the CPS. Furthermore, preliminary research
conducted at SSA indicates that SIPP_CPS poverty rate differences among the aged appear to vary significantly by
sex, age, marital status, race and ethnicity; differences appear to be particularly marked for persons who are married,
white, or age 85 or older.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies are needed (1) to describe more fully the pattern of SIPP_CPS differences in poverty estimates for the aged,
and (2) to establish, if possible, the factors giving rise to the observed differences. SIPP-CPS differences should
be delineated for population subgroups defined in terms of salient characteristics such as marital status, more
broadly defined aspects of family composition, including the presence of nonaged family members, age, race and ethnicity.
Differences should, at a minimum, be characterized in terms of poverty counts, rates, and the poverty gap. Particular
attention should be given to evaluating possible differences between the two surveys in the portrayal of poverty
as it relates to increasing age. Given that the pattern of poverty by population subgroup is of particular interest,
the relatively small sample size available in single SIPP panels as compared with the CPS is likely to be of some concern.
If, as is suggested by review of published estimates, it can be shown that the basic patterns of SIPP-CPS differences
are stable across the post-1984 SIPP panels, serious consideration should be given to pooling the post-1984 panels
in order to support as detailed a subgroup analysis as is possible, given the substantially larger sample sizes available
from pooled samples. If the combining of SIPP panels seems feasible, the combined panels should be employed to support
the explanatory phase of the overall study, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After developing a plan for documenting more fully SIPP-CPS differences in the portrayal of poverty among the aged,
the grantee might discuss how the observed differences might be explained. In this regard a critical review of the
literature that has considered the differences between poverty rate estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) and the CPS might prove quite useful in generating hypotheses and in formulating empirical approaches to testing
the hypotheses. While several possible factors are likely to be suggested by this review (e.g., sample weighting,
particularly that component of the overall weighting scheme designed to deal with panel attrition; differing operationalizations
of the income unit; differing income concepts; and the quality of income data), emphasis in empirical work should
be given to the last factor, the relative quality of the income data from the two surveys. However, some attention could
also be given to the change in SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates that occurred with the introduction of the
1985 SIPP panel.

 The nature of each hypothesized factor to be considered and how it might cause the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences
might be described. A closely reasoned plan for empirically assessing the possible impact data quality on the differences
in SIPP-CPS poverty rates for the aged may be presented. Particular emphasis should be given to explaining the relevance
of each proposed test for clarifying the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences, notwithstanding the fact that
it may not be possible to devise fully unambiguous tests of the effects of income data quality on the observed SIPP-CPS
differences.

The prospective grantee will find it useful to consult recent work conducted by the Bureau of the Census comparing
income estimates for calendar year 1990 from the two surveys and Report no. 17, Studies in Income Distribution, for
similar material related to SIPP/CPS differences for the 1983&hyph;84 period. Recent work conducted at the Bureau
of the Census by Lamas, Tin and Eargle about the effect of attrition in the SIPP context on differences in SIPP-CPS poverty
rates should also be consulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the level of available funding, empirical work should be limited to describing the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences
in poverty estimates (rates, counts, and gaps). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As much of the study will revolve around comparison of alternative estimates within or between survey contexts, issues
of statistical inference also need to be given careful consideration. In particular, given the results of SSA research
on the variance properties of SIPP-based estimates of the aged, standard errors for SIPP estimates should be based
on the generalized variance parameters as estimated by SSA (see the note by Bye and Gallicchio appearing in the winter
1993 Social Security Bulletin) or calculated directly from the survey file using the methods outlined in the Bye-Gallicchio
article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding
not to exceed 17 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application
is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant.

Court for the District of Alaska in settlement of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
United States of America v. State of Alaska, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. A91&hyph;081 CV. The Public Advisory Group was created to advise the Trustee Council on matters relating

The Trustee Council consists of representatives of the State of Alaska Attorney General; Commissioner of the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game; Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation; the Secretary
of the Interior; the Secretary of Agriculture; and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce. Appointment to the Public Advisory Group will be made by the Secretary of the Interior
with unanimous approval of the Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Advisory Group consists of 17 members representing the public at large (5 members) and the following special
interests: aquaculture, commercial fishing, commercial tourism, forest products, environmental, conservation,
local government, Native landowners, recreation users, sport hunting and fishing, subsistence, and science/academic.
Two additional ex officio non-voting members are from the Alaska State House of Representatives and the Alaska State
Senate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nominees need to submit the following information to the Trustee Council:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A biographical sketch (education, experience, address, telephone);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Information about the nominee's knowledge of the region, peoples, or principal economic and social activities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A disclosure statement of any potential conflict of interest. Public Advisory Group members and their alternates
are chosen to represent a broad range of interests. It is possible that action could be taken by the Public Advisory
Group when one or more of the members have a direct personal conflict of interest which would prejudice and call into
question the entire public process. To avoid this eventuality and to enable the Trustee Council to choose appropriate
individuals as members and/or alternates to members, it is necessary that each nominee provide the following information
with their information packet. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, please provide a brief explanation of
your answer. A yes will not necessarily preclude any nominee from being appointed to serve on the Public Advisory Group.

filed before any court or administrative tribunal based upon damages caused by the T/V Exxon Valdez oil spill?

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice makes available to the public a summary of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the proposed Master Plan for
the Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge, located in Jasper County, Iowa. Establishment of the 8,654-acre Refuge
was approved on September 5, 1990. Federal funding for design, construction, and operation of the Refuge is provided
through appropriations by the U.S. Congress. Pursuant to Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1505.2), the Service issues this ROD upon consideration of the
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) prepared for the Proposed Action. The U.S. Department of Army, Corps
of Engineers (USCOE), acting as a cooperating agency in the preparation of the FEIS also adopts the FEIS and ROD as its
NEPA documentation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Notice of Availability of the FEIS was published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 23, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS evaluated alternatives for four elements of the Master Plan: habitat/wildlife emphasis, management, programs,
and facilities siting. Based upon an evaluation of the impacts of the various alternatives on the physical, biological,
social, and economic environments, the Preferred Alternative was identified. The Preferred Alternative is a balance
of several options and is comprised of the following elements:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative I.D: Restoration and reconstruction of over 7000 acres of tallgrass prairie/savanna habitat with reintroduction
of bison and elk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative II.E: Active habitat reconstruction and management to maximize environmental education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative III.C: Intermediate refuge program including indoor and outdoor environmental education programs
and facilities, a visitor center with a tour route and trail system, small laboratory facilities and overnight accommodations
for researchers; and other opportunities for interpretation and recreational public use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative IV.B: Consolidated facilities siting the visitor center, research facilities and maintenance facility
in a central campus.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other alternatives considered included: the no build alternative, creation of extensive wetland habitat for waterfowl
and fisheries, limited public use programs and facilities and active prairie reconstruction to maximize research.

Comments Received

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to preparation of the FEIS, the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on the Proposed Master Plan for
the Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge was circulated for public review and comment. Comments were received from
agencies and individuals expressing concerns about the findings of the DEIS. Issues raised in these comments included
but were not limited to the habitat reconstruction process including seed sources, the potential for habitat fragmentation,
and the reintroduction of bison and elk; the potential environmental effects of recreational facilities; the siting
of Refuge facilities to minimize environmental impacts; Section 404 permit requirements; Refuge access; and historic
resource issues. All substantive issues raised in the comments have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Service
and the USCOE either through revisions incorporated into the FEIS text or responses contained in Section 6.5 of the
FEIS. These responses are incorporated by reference into the ROD. No comments were received on the FEIS.

Findings and Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon a careful review and consideration of the impacts identified in the FEIS, results of the various studies
and surveys conducted in conjunction with the DEIS and FEIS, public comments received on the DEIS, and other relevant
factors, including the purposes for which the Refuge was established by Congress and statutory and regulatory guidance
for funding such projects, the Service, with concurrence by the USCOE, finds as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Preferred Alternative consists of the programs and facilities mentioned above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Preferred Alternative represents the best balance between provision of environmental education, interpretive,
recreational, and research facilities and programs, minimization of environmental impacts, and public and agency
concerns identified during the public participation process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Consistent with economic, social, and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable, potential
adverse environmental effects identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided by incorporating mitigative measures
as conditions of Federal funding approval and permit issuance. These measures are described in Section 4.0 of the
FEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A wetland mitigation plan providing in-kind and on-site replacement for unavoidable adverse impacts to existing
wetlands has been developed and will be implemented, resulting in no net loss of wetland habitat values over time.
Specific details regarding the mitigation plan have been developed through the Section 404 permit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No state or federally listed endangered or threatened species or their critical habitats are known to be adversely
affected by the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) No historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places are known
to be adversely affected by the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Statutory authority for the Service to fund and implement, and for the USCOE to permit, the project exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The requirements of NEPA and the implementing regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) have been satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ROD serves as the written facts and conclusions relied upon in reaching this decision. A complete copy of the ROD
is filed at the Refuge together with the other NEPA documents. For further information contact: Mr. Richard M. Birger,

Pursuant to 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before
the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed
consummation date of August 4, 1994. Because the verified notice was filed June 16, 1994, consummation could not take
place prior to August 5, 1994. BN's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after
August 5, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Hughes Christiansen Co. a/k/a Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. Headquartered in Houston, TX; Amended Certification
Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The certification
notice was issued on May 17, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28429).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
investigation findings show that the correct name of the subject firm through December 31, 1992 was Hughes Christiansen
Company, Inc. In 1993, Hughes Cristiansen Company became an operating division of Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations,
Inc., and the claimants' wages were reported under an unemployment insurance (UI) tax account for Baker Hughes Oilfield
Operations, Inc., a subsidiary of Baker Hughes, Inc. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification
to properly reflect this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,603 is hereby issued as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All workers of Hughes Christiansen Company, Houston, Texas a/k/a Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., a subsidiary
of Baker Hughes, Inc., and operating at various locations in the following cited states who became totally or partially
separated from employment on or after January 11, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section
223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Sportette Industries, Inc., Nazareth, PA; NU-Place, Inc., Nazareth, PA; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility
to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on April 20, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24483).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
findings show that Nu-Place and Sportette were subsidiaries of Quartet Fashions in New York. The findings show that
production at Nu-Place was integrated with the production at Sportette and Nu-Place closed in January 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports
of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification by including
the workers at Nu-Place, Inc. in Nazareth, Pennsylvania.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,618 is hereby issued as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All workers of Sportette Industries, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania and Nu-Place, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania
engaged in the production of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after March 1, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade
Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Valeo Climate Control Corp., Fort Worth, TX; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA-Transitional
Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Pursuant to Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 103&hyph;182) concerning
transitional adjustment assistance, hereinafter called (NAFTA&hyph;TAA), and in accordance with Section 250(a),
Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2273), the Department of Labor issued
a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA-Transitional Adjustment assistance on April 22, 1994, applicable
to workers of Valeo Climate Control Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas. The certification did not apply to workers in
the Rapid Product Development Group at the Fort Worth, Texas location of Valeo Climate Control Corporation. The Notice
will be published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification. New information from the company shows
that worker separations from the Rapid Product Development Group of the Fort Worth, Texas facility of Valeo Climate
Control Corporation were related to the shift in production from the subject plant to Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's certification is amended to include workers in the Rapid Product Development Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to NAFTA&hyph;00051 is hereby issued as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All workers of Valeo Climate Control Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas, including workers in the Rapid Product Development
Group, who become totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply
for NAFTA&hyph;TAA under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1994.''

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public L. 92&hyph;463, as amended) notice is hereby
given that a meeting of the National Council on the Humanities will be held in Washington, D.C. on August 1&hyph;2,
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the meeting is to advise the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities with respect to policies,
programs, and procedures for carrying out his functions, and to review applications for financial support and gifts
offered to the Endowment and to make recommendations thereon to the Chairman.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting will be held in the Old Post Office Building, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. A portion
of the morning and afternoon sessions on August 1&hyph;2, 1994, will not be open to the public pursuant to subsections
(c)(4), (6) and (9)(B) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code because the Council will consider information
that may disclose: Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or
confidential; information of a personal nature the disclosure of which will constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy; and information the disclosure of which would significantly frustrate implementation of proposed
agency action. I have made this determination under the authority granted me by the Chairman's Delegation of Authority
dated July 19, 1993.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from June 13, 1994, through
June 23, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32226).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By August 5, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to John N. Hannon: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication
date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would merge Toledo Edison Company into Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. As described
in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. Therefore, the licensee uses the
nomenclature ``NEWCO'' as a temporary name of the combined operating company, and will provide the permanent name
by supplemental letter. The amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company with ``NEWCO'' as a licensee, (2) designate ``NEWCO'' as the owner of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1,
and (3) make other administrative changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior Service
Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Operating License are administrative and have no effect on any plant systems. All Limiting
Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety Systems Settings and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications
remain unchanged. This change meets one of the examples of a change not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration
in that it is a purely administrative changes (48 FR 14864).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Operating License are administrative and have no effect on any plant systems. All Limiting

in that it is a purely administrative change (48 FR 14864).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the Operating License are administrative and have no effect on any plant systems. All Limiting

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supporting qualification report for the subject criteria demonstrates that the presence of the tubesheet will
enhance the tube integrity in the region of the tube-to-tubesheet roll expansions by precluding tube deformation
beyond its initial expanded outside diameter. The resistance to a tube rupture is strengthened by the presence of
the tubesheet in that region. The results of hardrolling of the tube into the tubesheet provides a mechanical leak
limiting seal between the tube and the tubesheet. A tube rupture cannot occur because the contact between the tube
and the tubesheet does not permit sufficient movement of tube material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of degradation for which the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria has been developed (cracking with a circumferential orientation) can theoretically lead to a postulated
tube rupture event provided that the postulated through-wall circumferential crack exists near the top of the tubesheet.
An evaluation including analysis and testing has been done to determine the resistive strength of the expanded tubes
within the tubesheet. This evaluation provides the basis for the acceptance criteria for tube degradation subject
to the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 length of roll expansion is sufficient to preclude tube pullout from tube degradation located below the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance, regardless of the extent of the tube degradation. The Technical Specification leakage rate requirements
and accident analysis assumptions remain unchanged in the unlikely event that significant leakage from this region
does occur. The tube rupture and pullout is fully bounded by the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included
in the UFSAR. The leakage testing of the roll expanded tubes indicates that for tube expansion lengths approximately
equal to the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance, any postulated primary to secondary leakage from F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tubes would be insignificant. The proposed alternate repair criteria does not adversely impact any other previously
evaluated design basis accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leakage from an F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tube would be limited by the tube-to-tubesheet interface since this leak would occur below the secondary face of the
tubesheet. Qualification testing and previous experience indicate that normal and faulted leakage is well below
Technical Specification and administrative limits creating no increase in the consequences associated with tube
rupture type leakages. The UFSAR analyzed accident scenarios are still bounding since the normal and faulted leak
rates are well within the normal operating limit of 150 gallons per day. This conclusion is consistent with previous
F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 programs approved and used at other operating plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the design and operating characteristics of the steam generator and connected systems are preserved since
the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria utilizes the ``as rolled'' tube configuration that exists as part of the original steam generator design.
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 joint has been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted condition loadings in accordance with Regulatory
Guide 1.121 safety factors. The potential for tube rupture is not increased from the original submittal as demonstrated
in the qualification analyses and testing completed in the BWNT report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide
a mechanism to initiate an accident outside of the region of the expanded portion of the tube. In the unlikely event
the failed tube severed completely at a point below the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 region, the remaining F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 joint would retain engagement in the tubesheet due to its length of expanded contact within the tubesheet bore. This
engagement length would prevent any interaction of the severed tube with neighboring tubes. Any hypothetical accident
as a result of any tube degradation in the expanded region of the tube would be bounded by the existing tube rupture accident
analysis. Tube bundle structural integrity will be maintained. Tube bundle leak tightness will be maintained such
that any postulated accident leakage from F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tubes will be negligible with regard to offsite doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there is not a potential for creating the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria has been demonstrated to maintain the integrity of the tube bundle commensurate with the requirements of
Reg Guide 1.121 and the primary to secondary pressure boundary under normal and postulated accident conditions.
Acceptable tube degradation for the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria is any degradation indication in the tubesheet region, more than the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance from the secondary face of the tubesheet or the top of the last hardroll contact point which ever is further
into the tubesheet. The safety factors used in the verification of the strength of the degraded tube are consistent
with the safety factors in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and Reg Guide 1.121 used in steam generator design.
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance has been verified by various testing to be greater than the length of the roll expanded tube-to-tubesheet
interface required to preclude both tube pullout and significant leakage during normal and postulated accident
conditions. The protective boundaries of the steam generator continue to be maintained with the use of the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. A tube with the indication of degration previously requiring removal from service can be kept in service
through the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. Since the joint is constrained within the tubesheet bore, there is no additional risk associated with the
previously analyzed tube rupture event. The leak testing acceptance criteria are based on the primary to secondary
leakage limit in the Technical Specifications and the leakage assumptions used in the UFSAR accident analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the alternate repair criteria will decrease the number of tubes which must be taken out of service
with tube plugs or repaired by sleeves. Both plugs and sleeves reduce the RCS flow margin; thus, implementation of
the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased plugging or sleeving.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in margin with
respect to plant safety as defined in the UFSAR or the Technical Specification Bases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify the Reactor Trip System (RTS) and Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) instrumentation
surveillance requirements to incorporate the applicable changes specified in NRC-approved WCAP-10271 and related
supplements. Four specific changes were approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the RTS and Engineered
Safety Feature Actuation System analog channels. These changes are limited to the specific Reactor Protection System
(RPS) channels evaluated in the WCAP (including all supplements) and are subject to the conditions specified by the
NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The surveillance or test frequency may be changed from monthly to quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The time allowed for a channel to be inoperable or out of service in an untripped condition may be changed from 1 hour
to 6 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The time a channel in a functional group may be bypassed to perform testing may be increased from 2 to 4 hours. This
bypass time applies to either an inoperable channel when testing is done in the tripped mode or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to the channel in test when testing is done in the bypass mode. The Allowed Outage Time for maintenance of a channel is
12 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Routine channel testing may be performed in the bypassed condition instead of the tripped condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a number of editorial changes are made to improve clarity, and two-loop operating requirements are proposed
to be deleted. Also, the surveillance test interval for RTS interlocks is proposed to be changed from monthly to once-per-refueling
(about 18 months). Although not part of WCAP-10271, this was previously approved generically by NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination that the results of the proposed changes are within all acceptable criteria was established in
the SER(s) [Safety Evaluation Report(s)] prepared for WCAP-10271, WCAP-10271 Supplement 1, WCAP-10271 Supplement
2 and WCAP-10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1 issued by letters dated February 21, 1985, February 22, 1989 and April 30,
1990. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection
System yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in an
increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the probability
of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in Core Damage Frequency (CDF) due to Engineered
Safety Features Actuation System unavailability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core
melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5
fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of RPS instrumentation. This reduction
is primarily attributable to testing in bypass and less frequent surveillance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in [***] core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability
resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values determined by the WOG [Westinghouse Owners Group] and presented in the WCAP for the increase in CDF were
verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff. Based
on the small value of the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the CDF, the increase is considered acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to Surveillance Test Frequencies for the Reactor Trip System Interlocks do not represent a significant reduction
in testing. The currently specified test interval for interlock channels allows the surveillance requirement to
be satisfied by verifying that the permissive logic is in its required state using the annunciator status light. The
surveillance, as currently required, only verifies the status of the permissive logic and does not address verification
of channel setpoint or operability. The setpoint verification and channel operability are verified after a refueling
shutdown. The definition of the channel check includes comparison of the channel status with other channels for the
same parameter. The requirement to routinely verify permissive status is a different consideration than the availability
of trip or actuation channels which are required to change state on the occurrence of an event and for which the function
availability is more dependent on the surveillance interval. The change in surveillance requirement to at least
once every 18 months does not therefore represent a significant change in channel surveillance and does not involve
a significant increase in unavailability of the Reactor Protection System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not result in an increase in the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes affects the probability of failure of the RPS but does not alter the manner
in which protection is afforded nor the manner in which limiting criteria are established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not result in a change in the manner in which the Reactor Protection System provides plant protection.
No change is being made which alters the functioning of the Reactor Protection System (other than in a test mode). Rather
the likelihood or probability of the Reactor Protection System functioning properly is affected as described above.
Therefore,the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident nor involve a reduction
in a margin of safety as defined in the Safety Analysis Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve hardware changes except those necessary to implement testing in bypass. Some
existing instrumentation is designed to be tested in bypass and current technical specifications allow testing
in bypass. Testing in bypass is also recognized by IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Standards.
Therefore, testing in bypass has been previously approved and implementation of the proposed change for testing
in bypass does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Furthermore,
since the other proposed changes do not alter the functioning of the RPS, the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints or limiting
conditions for operation are determined. The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a
longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Experience has shown that the initial
uncertainty assumptions are valid for reduced testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Less frequent testing will result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and fewer actuations of Engineered Safety
Feature Actuation System components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Improvements in the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation. This
is due to less frequent distraction of the operator and shift supervisor to attend to instrumentation testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Specifications 3.4.9.3 and 3.4.11 to incorporate power operated relief valve
(PORV) Technical Specification (TS) changes in accordance with the guidance in Generic Letter 90-06 as implemented
in NUREG-1431 Improved Standard Technical Specifications (ISTS), with some exceptions and modifications to reflect
plant specific design features. Certain other TS sections would also be modified to address related TSs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve the details of (a) limiting conditions of operation, and (b) surveillance testing for
equipment needed to protect the reactor vessel from overpressure conditions. This equipment includes PORVs and
their associated block valves, charging pumps, reactor coolant system (RCS) vent, accumulators, and the overpressure
protection system. Numerous administrative changes are also proposed, such as renumbering sections, spelling
out mathematical symbols, changes in nomenclature for consistency, and relocating sentences and paragraphs.

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes consolidate the power operated relief valve requirements into Specifications 3.4.9.3 and
3.4.11 which generally adopt the new Improved Standard Technical Specifications of NUREG-1431 to address the concerns
identified in Generic Letter 90-06 except for those changes required to reflect plant specific design features.
These changes are proposed to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves. Since the proposed
changes augment or preserve the requirements contained in the current technical specifications, we have concluded
that these changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to the PORVs or their setpoints. These changes do not delete
any function previously provided by the PORVs nor has the probability of inadvertent opening been increased. Accordingly,
no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
single failure been identified as a result of these changes. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes have been incorporated to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves
to ensure their availability when called upon to perform their function. These changes do not affect the manner by
which the facility is operated or involve a change to equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics
of the facility. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis. The staff notes that a significant effort has been made by the NRC
and by industry over the last several years to improve and tighten the TS requirements for overpressure protection
systems. These efforts are documented in Generic Letter 90-06 and NUREG-1431. The changes proposed by the licensee
appear to result in TSs that are significantly more comprehensive and restrictive than those now existing for Beaver
Valley Units 1 and 2, and, therefore, should help to reduce the probability of an accident. The staff disagrees with
the licensee's claim that the changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated (consideration number
3 above). However, the staff believes that the proposed TS changes require more restrictive operation (such as more
careful control of the number of charging pumps which can inject into the RCS) and do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Based on the NRC staff's review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification section 4.8.1.1.2 to replace the current qualitative

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated since the diesel generator availability and reliability is not being changed. The quantitative acceptance
criteria for new fuel oil is not being changed. Diesel generator performance will therefore not be changed due to the
proposed revision to SR [surveillance requirement] 4.8.1[.1].2.d.1.d. The diesel generator will continue to provide
sufficient electrical power to ESF [engineered safety feature] systems. The ESF systems will continue to function,
as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant system, and containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design limits are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this changes will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated due
to the continued availability and reliability of the emergency diesel power source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the method of operating the plant. This change will continue to ensure that the addition
of new fuel oil complies with accepted standards regarding fuel oil quality. Since design requirements continue
to be met and the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new failure mode has
been created. As a result, an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report will not be created due to this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is not reduced because the emergency diesel generators will continue to provide sufficient capacity,
capability, redundancy, and reliability to ensure availability of necessary power to ESF systems. The ESF systems
will continue to function, as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant systems, and
containment design limits are not exceeded. The replacement of the clear and bright qualitative examination with
the proposed quantitative test to determine the actual water/sediment and particulates will ensure that new fuel
oil meets the required limits for these properties prior to addition to the storage tank, therefore assuring that
the quality of the stored fuel is unaffected by the addition of new fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will delete from Facility Operating License No. NPF-73 the Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement
to perform infrared aerial photography every other year. The acceptance limit which forms the licensing basis for
this technical specification is related to environmental impact and has no impact on the margin of safety, accident
analysis, or other design basis impacting the margin of safety. No increase in adverse environmental impact has been
identified over that previously identified in the Final Environmental Statement - Operating License Stage, environmental
impact appraisals, or in any decisions of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. The Final Environmental Statement
concluded, based on a model of combined drift from Units 1 and 2, that no adverse impacts to sensitive species of natural
vegetation or to sensitive species of crops were expected. The staff also examined infrared aerial photographs taken
from 1975 through 1983 and found no injury to vegetation from cooling tower drift in the vicinity of Unit 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued terrestrial monitoring was performed for Beaver Valley Unit 2 by infrared aerial photography in 1986,
1988, 1990, and 1992. The results as provided in the Annual Environmental Reports Non-Radiological concluded, ``Based
on interpretation of the infrared photographs and field verification, there is no evidence to suggest that the BVPS
[Beaver Valley Power Station] cooling towers are causing vegetation stress.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the compilation of the infrared aerial photography performed for both BV-1 and BV-2, deletion of this terrestrial
monitoring requirement will have no impact on the environment or the operation of the plant. Therefore, the proposed
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement to perform infrared aerial photography reflects a commitment described
in Final Environmental Statement Section 5.14.1. Therein it is stated that the preoperational monitoring studies
for BV-2 are based primarily on the BV-1 operational monitoring programs. ``Results of these studies have shown that
there were no BV-1 operational impacts on flora, thus, the only terrestrial monitoring planned for BV-2 is continued
infrared aerial photography every other year. The photographs will be compared with preoperational photographs
of the BV-2 area, nd any signs of injury as a result of salt drift and other sources will be checked. The details of this
terrestrial monitoring program will be specified in the Environmental Protection Plan that will be included in Appendix
B of the operating license.'' The subject of this concern is the impact of salt and water drift on area vegetation including
sensitive agricultural crops. From the standpoint of soil salinization (the effects of the accumulation of salts
in the soil), described in the Environmental Report-Operating License Stage Section 5.3.3, no appreciable impact
resulting from operation of the natural draft cooling towers is anticipated. This is based on the average rate of precipitation
of 36.2 inches annually which greatly reduces the potential for accumulation of salt in the soil. The terrestrial
monitoring program has been performed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Plan and has provided additional
verification that operation of both cooling towers has not produced any evidence of vegetation stress. The proposed
change does not introduce any new mode of plant operation or require any physical modification to the plant, therefore,
this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrared aerial photography surveillance does not affect safety systems and/or systems important to safety. Terrestrial
monitoring is not used in any accident analysis and does not provide a basis for evaluating the radiological consequences
of an accident. Deleting the requirement to perform infrared aerial photography will not result in any environmental
impact from operation of the cooling tower and will not affect the operation of the cooling tower. The operating history
of both the BV-1 and the BV-2 cooling towers has demonstrated that there is no evidence of vegetation stress in accordance
with the results obtained from the infrared aerial photography and other associated methods of environmental monitoring.
Therefore, based on the above, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment will revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 for Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) by removing
the option that allows High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) Pump 1C to be used as an alternative to the preferred pump
for subsystem operability. HPSI pump 1C is an installed spare which is not required to be maintained in an operable
status, and this change is being requested to upgrade the ECCS operability requirements consistent with actual plant
operating needs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment will remove the option of using High Pressure Safety Injection Pump 1C (HPSI-1C) to
satisfy, in part, the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) operabilityrequirements specified in Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2. HPSI-1C is an installed spare pump that is not required to be operable unless it is being
used in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump. The required functional response of the ECCS or the
required availability of the minimum equipment necessary to accomplish the ECCS safety function will not be changed
by removing the spare pump option from the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated cooling performance of the St. Lucie Unit 1 ECCS during postulated accidents conforms to the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 50.46 and the ability to achieve this required performance, including considerations of single-failure
criteria, is independent from optional use of HPSI-1C. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
Eliminating the option for the licensee to utilize HPSI-1C in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump
does not involve the addition of new or different types of equipment to the previously analyzed ECCS. Equipment important
to safety will continue to perform their safety functions as previously analyzed and will not be affected by this proposed
amendment. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing the option to employ the installed spare HPSI pump 1C in lieu of the preferred B-train pump to determine ECCS
operability only removes an operational flexibility that has rarely been used by the licensee. St. Lucie Unit 1 accident
analyses do not take credit for an installed spare pump, the minimum complement of safety injection equipment required
for safe operation of the facility and that is required by LCO 3.5.2 is not changed, and the results of plant accident
and transient analyses are not influenced by this proposed amendment. The proposed change does not alter the bases
for any Technical Specification related to the establishment of, or maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.

Seismic monitoring instrumentation is not an accident initiator nor a part of the success path(s) which function
to mitigate accidents evaluated in the plant safety analyses. The proposed technical specification change does
not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the
consequences of an accident, nor do the changes alter any assumptions or conditions in any of the plant accident analyses.
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase

the magnitude of a seismic event, should it occur. Conditions evaluated in plant accident and transient analyses
do not involve seismic instruments. The proposed changes do not alter the basis for any technical specification that
is related to the establishment of, or the maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specifications Section 3/4.7.1.1, Turbine Cycle, Safety Valves, to delete
a specific reference to the 1974 edition of the ASME Code and refer to testing in accordance with Technical Specification
4.0.5, the In-Service Inspection and In-Service Testing Specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the main steam code safety valves will continue to be tested in accordance with current
NRC requirements as implemented through 10 CFR 50.55a. The NRC specifies the ASME code requirements for a facility
through revisions to 10 CFR 50.55a and through the review and approval of the plant specific in-service testing plan
for pumps and valves at the beginning of each in-service inspection interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability or consequences of an accident are not increased because testing of the main steam safety valves is
in accordance with the appropriate NRC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of this modified specification can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated since there is no physical change to the facility or the set points for the main steam safety valves.
The valves will be tested in accordance with current requirements. No new failure mode is introduced due to the change
because no plant change is being made and main steam safety valve test methods are consistent with the endorsed edition
of the ASME Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing technical specification references an outdated version of the ASME Code. This change corrects the reference
to Specification 4.0.5 which ensures that in-service testing of ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 pumps and valves will be
performed in accordance with a periodically updated version of Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
and Addenda as required by 10 CFR 50.55a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety valve setpoints or tolerances are not changed by this proposal. Therefore, the modified specification corrects
the ASME Code reference and does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, we have determined that the proposed amendment does not (1) involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the probability of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety; and therefore
does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the requested revisions do not affect the FSAR safety analyses involving these system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to Definition 15, ``Primary Containment Integrity'' and Definition 16, ``Secondary Containment
Integrity'' agree with the corresponding definitions of the STS. These changes are administrative in nature in that
they only clarify the requirements for containment integrity and the appropriate means of isolating penetrations.
These changes do not affect the operation or function of the containment isolation systems and, therefore, do not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary Containment Integrity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to TS section 3.7.A, ``Primary Containment Integrity'', only adds a specific requirement to restore
primary containment integrity within 1 hour or commence a plant shutdown. These actions are consistent with the actions
specified in STS for primary containment integrity. No changes to the primary containment boundary or the requirements
for primary containment integrity have been proposed. Therefore, this change does not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to TS section 3.7.B, ``Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves'' are editorial in nature
in that the wording has only been changed to be consistent with the STS requirements for primary containment isolation
valves. These changes do not affect the function of the valves, the requirements to isolate a penetration with an inoperable
containment isolation valve or the actual methods of isolation. Penetrations are still required to be isolated within
4 hours in a manner that cannot be adversely affected by a single active failure. Therefore, these changes do not result
in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drywell Average Air Temperature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of limits, actions, and surveillance requirements for drywell average air temperature are intended
to ensure that the initial assumptions in the DAEC Primary Containment Response Analysis to a DBA remain valid. The
temperature limit (135
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) corresponds to the initial drywell average temperature assumed for this analysis in the UFSAR. The specified
limits, actions and surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. The addition of this limit to the TS will not
affect the actual operation or function of any equipment but will ensure that the containment analysis remains valid.
Therefore, the addition of this limit will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressure Suppression Chamber-Reactor Building Vacuum Breakers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.D only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the pressure suppression
chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS.
Specifying separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed),
or open better reflects the dual functions of these valves (vacuum relief and containment isolation). The additional
surveillance requirement will better ensure that the containment isolation function of these valves is maintained.
The rewording of existing surveillances only clarifies current requirements. These changes do not affect the actual
function, setpoints, or number of valves required to be operable and therefore do not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drywell-Pressure Suppression Chamber Vacuum Breakers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.E, only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the drywell-pressure
suppression chamber vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS. Specifying
separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed) or open better
reflects the dual functions of these valves. The additional requirement to verify that each vacuum breaker is closed
at least once per week will better ensure that the isolation boundary between the drywell and torus is maintained.
The elimination of the requirement to exercise all operable drywell-pressure suppression chamber vacuum breakers
upon determination that a vacuum breaker is inoperable for opening will not affect the reliability of these vacuum
breakers. The only valid reason to exercise the operable vacuum breakers is if a common mode failure is suspected.
We have reviewed the maintenance history of these valves and have not identified any instance of common mode failures.
Conditional testing of these changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Main Steam Isolation Valve Leakage Control System (MSIV-LCS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to TS Section 3/4.7.F, ``MSIV-LCS'', deletes the unnecessary and potentially non-conservative conditional
surveillance testing of the redundant MSIV-LCS subsystems. Although the proposed change will reduce the amount
of testing of the MSIV-LCS, reliability of these systems would not be decreased and the necessary assurance that the
alternate systems/subsystems/components will operate when needed is provided by the ASME Section XI IST Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of human error will decrease with reduced testing. Human error such as a misalignment of valves after
the system is returned to its normal configuration following testing and the misdirection of the operators attention
from monitoring and directing plant operations is less likely to occur if this testing is eliminated. Additionally,
reducing the scope and frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the probability of equipment failure (due
to testing) which could require plant shutdown. Therefore, this change will not increase the probability of occurrence
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suppression Pool Level and Temperature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.F, ``Suppression Pool Level and Temperature'', are intended to clarify these requirements
and make them more consistent with STS. The revision to the applicability statement which deletes the requirement
for suppression pool level and temperature to be within the specified limits during work which has the potential to
drain the vessel is in accordance with STS. Suppression pool level and temperature limits ensure that the suppression
pool has the capability of acting as a heat sink for design basis events but are not appropriate or applicable during
the refueling or cold shutdown conditions. No changes have been made to the actual suppression pool temperature or
level limits and therefore, the assumptions made in the accident and transient analyses remain valid. These limits
are consistent with the STS. The revisions to the surveillance requirements are also intended to improve clarity
and consistency with STS. The deletion of the requirement to monitor suppression pool water temperature every 5 minutes
during relief valve operation is appropriate in that plant operating and emergency operating procedures already
specify what actions are to be taken when suppression pool average water temperature increases above 95
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F including initiation of suppression pool cooling. Monitoring pool temperature every 5 minutes during these
events is not necessary and is redundant to other actions. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase
the probability of occurrence of the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containment Atmosphere Dilution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the applicability of TS section 3.7.H, ``Containment Atmosphere Dilution'', requiring the containment
atmosphere dilution system to be operable only when the reactor is in power operation and the primary containment
is required to be inerted will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the CAD system can only function when the containment is inerted. The function of the CAD system
is to inject nitrogen into the containment after a LOCA and ensure the containment remains inerted. Drywell inspections
performed after plant startup and prior to plant shutdown require that the primary containment be de-inerted for
personnel access. Therefore, CAD system operability is not required during these inspections. No changes to the
actual function or purpose of the CAD system are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oxygen Concentration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.1, ``Oxygen Concentration'' are administrative in that they only clarify the requirement
that both the suppression chamber and the drywell must have oxygen concentrations less than 4 [percent] by volume.
The revisions to the surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. Decreasing the frequency of verification
of oxygen concentration from twice per week to once per week is in accordance with STS and reflects the fact that during
power operation, the containment is inerted and slightly pressurized such that air (oxygen) cannot leak into the
containment. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary Containment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion of the requirement to operate the SGTS immediately after a secondary containment violation is identified
will not affect the reliability of the secondary containment in that containment integrity is normally fully restored
immediately after a violation is identified. The testing of the SGTS involves insertion of a Group III containment
isolation signal and is only appropriate if the restoration of secondary containment involves a temporary or new
secondary containment boundary. These modifications to a secondary containment boundary, however, would require
that the SGTS be operated as part of post modification testing. Deleting the requirement for the SGTS to be operated
after minor secondary containment violations will reduce the possibility of human error (such as misalignment of
valves after the system is returned to its normal configuration) due to reduced testing. Operation of the SGTS after
a secondary containment violation is not required by STS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision of the definition of calm wind conditions will not affect the reliability or availability of the secondary
containment or SGTS. An engineering evaluation on the effects of wind speed and direction on the ability of the SGTS
to maintain 1/4'' vacuum in secondary containment has been performed. The results indicate that while wind effects
can be seen on individual instruments, there is minimal effect on the average instrument readings with wind speeds
up to 15 mph. A discussion of this evaluation has been added to the Bases of TS section 3.7. Therefore, these changes
will not significantly increase the probability or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary Containment Automatic Isolation Dampers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of operability requirements, actions and surveillance requirements for secondary containment isolation
dampers better ensures the integrity and isolation capability of the secondary containment. The new specifications
are consistent with the requirements of the STS. The actual function or operation of the secondary containment isolation
valves/dampers will not be affected. The appropriate valves/dampers will be incorporated in plant procedures that
are subject to the change control provisions of TS. Therefore, these changes will not increase the probability of
occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the TS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standby Gas Treatment System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to the output requirements of the inlet heaters for each train of the SGTS from 11 kw to 22 kw better ensures
that these heaters (and the SGTS) can perform their design function. The 22 kw output requirement ensures that the
inlet air humidity does not exceed the 70 [percent] humidity specified in the UFSAR. This change does not affect the
actual operation of the heaters or the SGTS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to demonstrate the HEPA filter uniform air distribution after HEPA filter replacement or after structural
maintenance on the filter system housing (rather than annually) will not decrease the reliability of the SGTS. The
air flow test will be performed after work or modifications which have the ability to disrupt the system geometry or
result in potential flow blockage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the shutdown LCO requirement in the various specifications from requiring the plant to be in Cold Shutdown
in 24 hours to requiring Hot Shutdown in 12 hours and Cold Shutdown (or other condition not requiring equipment operability)
in the following 24 hours is consistent with STS and the shutdown requirements in TS section 3.5. This new requirement
will allow the reactor to be shutdown in a more controlled manner and will not result in a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the Bases are administrative in that they only reflect the changes to the individual specifications
described previously in this section or correct minor discrepancies. All changes are consistent with the applicable
specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed amendment will not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the above response to question #1, none of the proposed changes alters the design of the plant or equipment
or the plant's transient response. The changes to the definitions and limiting conditions for operation applicable
to TS section 3.7 are consistent with STS and better ensure that equipment assumed to be operable in our accident analysis
will be operable upon demand. The addition of limiting conditions for operation for drywell average temperature
and secondary containment isolation valves will better ensure that the assumptions in our accident analysis remain
valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the surveillance requirements are consistent with the STS. Those systems required to mitigate accidents
evaluated in the UFSAR will still be operable and available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in conditional surveillance testing of certain systems and equipment will reduce the probability
of equipment failure as a result of excessive testing or due to human error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the limiting conditions for operation in Chapter 3.7 of the TS will not invalidate the original licensing
basis assumptions and will not invalidate any assumptions or input parameters for any DAEC event analysis. These
changes provide more specific guidance only and are in accordance with the STS. Extending the time period within which
the DAEC must achieve Cold Shutdown conditions will permit increased operator attention and minimal distractions
for operators during shutdown, thus minimizing the risks of unexpected operational transients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional surveillance testing for certain instrumentation and systems will provide additional assurance that
these systems will be available when needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elimination of unnecessary or conditional surveillance testing will not reduce the minimum necessary equipment
operability requirements or equipment reliability. Elimination of the redundant testing will reduce equipment
failure due to excessive testing or human error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed administrative changes do not change the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and do not involve a reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed license amendment is judged to involve no significant hazards consideration.

The amendment would temporarily allow the Operations Manager to not have a senior reactor operator (SRO) license
for Millstone 3, providing other conditions are met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change affects only an administrative control, which was based on the existing industry guidance in
ANSI N18.1-1971, that recommended the Operations Manager hold a SRO license. The current guidance in Section 4.2.2
of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987 recommends, as one option, that the Operations Manager have held a license for a similar unit
and the Operations Middle Manager hold a SRO license. The Operations Middle Manager position does not exist at NNECO
[Northeast Nuclear Energy Company]. Therefore, the proposed change requests an exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 to
allow use of ANSI/ANS-3.101987 in a limited circumstance. Specifically, the proposed revision to Technical Specification
6.3.1 would temporarily allow the Operations Manager to have held a SRO at a PWR [pressurized water reactor] other
than Millstone Unit No. 3. The proposed revision would be in effect for the period ending three years after the Staff's
approval for this request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposed exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 will allow at least one of the Operations Assistants (instead of a Operations
Middle Manager) to hold, and continue to hold, a SRO license, if the Operations Manager does not hold a license. The
proposed change includes the requirement if the Operations Manager does not hold a SRO license at Millstone Unit No.
3, he shall have held a license for a similar unit in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987. For those
areas of knowledge that require a SRO license, at least one of the Operations Assistants hold a SRO license and provides
technical guidance normally required by the Operations Manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the design of any system, structure, or component. It does not change the way any
plant systems are operated. It does not reduce the knowledge, qualifications, or skills of any operator on watch,
and does not affect the way the Operations Department is managed by the Operations Manager in maintaining the effective
performance of his personnel and to ensure the plant is operated safely and in accordance with the requirements of
the Operating License. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not detract from the Operations Manager's ability to perform his primary responsibilities.
In this case, by having previously held a SRO license for a similar unit, he will have gained the necessary training,
skills, and experience to fully understand the operation of plant equipment and the watch requirements for operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not weaken the supervisory chain that presently exists in the Operations Department. All
Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by the licensed Shift Supervisor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed change does not affect the ability of the Operations Manager to provide the plant oversight
required of his position. In addition, it does not have any [e]ffect on the probability or consequences of any previously
evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Technical Specification 6.3.1 does not affect the design or function of any plant system, structure,
or component. It does not affect, in any way, the performance of NRC licensed operators, nor does it change the way any
plant equipment is operated. Operation of the plant in conformance with technical specifications and other license
requirements will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold an NRC SRO license. The proposed change to Technical
Specification 6.3.1 ensures that the Operations Manager will be a knowledgeable and qualified individual. The proposed
change does not introduce any new failure modes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves only an administrative control which is not related to the margin of safety as defined
in the technical specifications. The proposed change does not reduce the level of knowledge or experience required
of an individual who fills the Operations Manager position, nor does it affect the conservative manner in which the
plant is operated. All Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold a SRO license.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not affect the the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The safety analysis performed for this change concludes that the ground water level is stable, predictable, and significantly
below the acceptance criteria established in the Technical Specifications. Thus, less frequent monitoring of the
ground water level does not increase the probability that the Spray Pond will become inoperable due to rising ground
water levels or the probability of any accident scenarios associated with Spray Pond inoperability. The Technical
Specification change will not impact the function or the method of operation of plant systems, structures, or components.
Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR are not
increased by the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change dies not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation
of the SSCs; and therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance frequency to biannual does not reduce
the margin of safety. The ground water level in the vicinity of the Spray Pond has been proven to be stable and predictable
through twelve years of monthly data collection. This data has shown the highest ground water levels (still considerably
lower than the Technical Specification limit) to occur in the months of April and October. Therefore, surveillance
of the ground water level at the observation sites during April and October will adequately monitor this aspect of
the Spray Pond operability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to relocate the Salem specific radiation monitor numbers to the Bases is administrative. There

would be increased from 0.2 to 1.0 micro Ci/gm. The limit for total specific activity of the reactor coolant would be
increased from 84 to 100/E micro Ci/gm, where E is the average beta and gamma energies per disintegration in Mev. Both
increased allowable levels are consistent with NUREG-1431 ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation is consistent with NRC requirements concerning this instrumentation. This
instrumentation is considered NNS [nonnuclear safety] and performs a local monitoring and alarm function only.
In addition, the NRC has recently approved the removal of Core Spray Sparger Break Detection Instrumentation from
the Technical Specifications of another BWR [boiling water reactor] with a similar situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. CS Sparger Piping integrity is still assured. The instrumentation
systems to be removed from the ECCS Actuation Instrumentation Technical Specifications do not perform any automatic
control or trip function. In addition, this instrumentation does not provide information that is required to permit
the control room operator to take manual actions that are required for safety systems to accomplish their safety functions
for design basis accident events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not result in any system hardware modification, function change or new plant configuration.
The requested change to ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not impact any FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] safety
analysis involving the ECCS or Protection Systems. These monitoring functions are not contributors to the initiation
of accidents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative changes to correct typographical errors on Tables 3.2.1 and 4.2.1 will have no affect on plant
hardware, plant design, safety limit setting or plant system operation and therefore, do not modify or add any initiating
parameters that would significantly increase the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is concluded that there is not a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The function of the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation to be removed from the Technical Specifications
is for local indication and alarm only. These functions are not necessary for operators to accomplish any safety functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any change in hardware, function, Technical Specification trip setpoints,
plant operation, redundancy, protective function or design basis of the plant. There is no impact on any existing
safety analysis or safety design limits. Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation functions do not initiate
nuclear system parameter variations which are considered potential initiating causes of threats to the fuel and
the nuclear system process barrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed administrative change only corrects typographical errors concerning equipment
identification numbers. This change doe not affect any equipment and it does not involve any potential initiating
events that would create any new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not affect any existing safety margins. This equipment is NNS and performs
a local indication and alarming function only. The original intent of this detection system was because the first
BWR plants had only the CS System for long-term core cooling. Later, plants like VY [Vermont Yankee] were provided
with Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Systems in addition to CS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Technical Specification requirements for automatic trip functions are unaffected. Failure of the Core
Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not preclude the ability of the CS System to perform its safety function
to mitigate the consequences of accidents or of any other safety system to accomplish its safety functions. Proper
ECCS functioning post-accident is not relied upon by NNS alarming functions but by such systems as safety related
reactor level indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. The removal from the Technical Specifications has no affect
on the bases of Protective Instrumentation which is to operate to initiate required system protective actions. The
Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not perform any safety function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed administrative change which corrects typographical errors does not affect any
equipment involved in potential initiating events or safety limits. [***].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1993, the licensee submitted a significant modification to its original request of March 18, 1992 (April
19, 1992 (57 FR 12349)). The modified request would amend the Technical Specifications (TS) to provide two surveillance
tests to determine the operability of the catalyst beds in the containment atmospheric control (CAC) system. One
test compares hydrogen content in the influent to the hydrogen content in effluent process streams to assure the catalyst
is operating. The second test measures the temperature profile in the catalyst bed to ensure that sufficient catalyst
remains available for the recombination process during postulated accident conditions. Since the original proposal
has been significantly changed, the staff is issuing a new notice and proposed no significant hazards consideration
determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is
presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of the hydrogen recombiners, which are
accident mitigation systems. The proposed change revises surveillance requirements to ensure that existing equipment
will perform as designed in response to postulated events. The proposed change does not, therefore, involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of existing equipment, and does not, therefore,
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change increases surveillance requirements for existing equipment to ensure that the equipment will
perform as designed. With equipment performing as designed in response to postulated accidents, the proposed change
does not affect any existing margins of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the licensee's analysis and the staff's analysis, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant Technical Specifications (TS) by incorporating
operability and surveillance requirements for the recently installed Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure
Trip instrumentation. Proposed surveillance requirements would be added to Table TS 4.1-1, ``Minimum Frequencies
for Checks, Calibrations and Test of Instrument Channels.'' TS 3.4, ``Steam and Power Conversions System,'' would
be revised to explicitly link operability of the associated Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip
channel to operability of the associated auxiliary feedwater pump. In addition, minor format inconsistencies in
TS 3.4.b.1.A and 3.4.b.1.B would be corrected.

The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change defines the necessary surveillance requirements for the recently installed Auxiliary Feedwater
Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip channels. The intent of adding surveillance requirements to the TS's is to ensure
the availability and reliability of the components. The proposed change is an additional restriction not presently
included in the TS's. Therefore, it will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
in the USAR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed revision is an additional requirement in the TS's to ensure the availability and reliability of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change defines the necessary operability requirements for the recently installed Auxiliary Feedwater
Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip channels. Installation of this protection was recommended and approved by the NRC
prior to their installation. The proposed change requires that the reactor not be heated &gt; 350
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F unless both motor driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps and their associated low discharge pressure trip channels
are operable. Also, the reactor shall not be heated &gt; 350

&cir;F unless the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump and its associated low discharge pressure trip channel
are operable, or if not demonstrated operable prior to &gt; 350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, they shall be declared inoperable when 350
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is exceeded. Furthermore, when the reactor is &gt; 350
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, an auxiliary feedwater pump low discharge pressure trip channel may be inoperable for a period not to exceed
4 hours. If this time is exceeded, the associated auxiliary feedwater pump shall be declared inoperable and the appropriate
limiting condition for operation of TS 3.4.b.2 entered. The intent of adding these operability requirements to the
TS's is to ensure the availability of the components. The proposed change is an additional restriction not presently
included in the TS's. Therefore, it will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
in the USAR.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment request proposes to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to implement the NRC's Final Policy Statement
on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors (58 FR 39132). These improvements involve focusing
the Technical Specifications on those requirements that are of controlling importance to operational safety by
screening each TS in Section 3/4.1 through 3/4.11 using the criteria provided in the policy statement. The purpose
of the proposed amendment request is to relocate the specifications that do not meet any of the four policy statement
criteria. The relocated specifications will be moved to Updated Final Safety Analysis (USAR) Chapter 16. Based on
the screening, all or part of 38 technical specifications were identified as not meeting any of the criteria and, therefore,
as candidates for relocation. The licensee has categorized the TS changes as (1) specifications relocated intact
to USAR Chapter 16, (2) specifications relocated with portions retained in TS, (3) specifications relocated with
programmatic requirements referenced in Section 6 of TS, (4) modifications to retained specifications to accomodate
relocation of other specifications, and (5) new specification requirements incorporated into the TS. The last category
is used to effect the retention of portions of relocated specifications and accomodate the policy statement recommendation
to incorporate industry experience in the determination of TS content.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes involve relocating requirements that are not conditions or limitations
on reactor operation necessary to obviate the possibility of an abnormal situation or event giving rise to an immediate
threat to the public health and safety. The proposed changes were identified through the application of criteria
designed to cull those requirements that are not important to operational safety from the Technical Specifications.
In this process, selected provisions of the Technical Specifications identified for relocation were retained if
necessary to support a Technical Specification that was to be retained. Thus, only specification requirements that
have little or no operational safety significance are proposed for relocation. In addition, those requirements
that would be relocated will be included in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and, therefore, will be
controlled and implemented as NRC commitments. In this manner, those requirements that have no operational safety
significance but involve maintaining the plant in its as-designed state (for example, through surveillance programs)
would be controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the criteria for identifying requirements to be retained in the Technical Specifications specifically
call out, for retention, those structures, systems, or components that are required to mitigate accidents previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to another licensee-controlled
document. No changes or physical alterations of the plant are involved. Also, no changes to the operation of the plant
or equipment are involved. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do the proposed changes involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to the USAR. The requirements to
be relocated were identified by applying the criteria endorsed in the Commission's Policy Statement. Thus, those
specifications that would be relocated do not impose constraints on design and operation of the plant that are derived
form the plant safety analysis report or from probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) information and do not belong
in the Technical Specifications in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36 and the purpose of the Technical Specifications stated
in the Policy Statement. Therefore, relocation of these requirements does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, revisions to the USAR will be evaluated in accordance with the 10 CFR 50.59 process which considers the
reduction in safety margin. Therefore, any future revisions to the provisions in the USAR will consider reductions
in the margin of safety using the criteria for identifying an unreviewed safety question.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Operation at 3565 MWt does not
affect any of the mechanisms postulated in the USAR to cause LOCA or non-LOCA design basis events. Analyses, evaluations
and minimum DNBR [departure from nucleate boiling ratio] calculations confirm that the USAR conclusions remain
valid for the proposed changes. On these bases it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents
previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possiblity of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created. The proposed change provides revised operating limits
necessary to support Cycle 8, and does not change the method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases
in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The analyses and evaluations discussed in the safety
evaluation demonstrate that all applicable safety analysis acceptance criteria continue to be met for the proposed
operating conditions. Items not specifically cited in this safety evaluation have been reviewed and have been found
to be bounded by the evaluations performed for Reference 1 [Wolf Creek Generating Station Technical Specifications].
Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical specification, is
not reduced.

During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application complies with the standards and requirements
of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission
has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I,
which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards

as indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applications for amendment, (2) the amendment, and (3) the
Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment as indicated. All of these items

The amendments modify the TS for the overpressure protection systems. The allowable outage time (AOT) for one inoperable
residual heat removal (RHR) relief valve with one or more of the reactor coolant system cold leg temperatures less
than or equal to 310 degrees Fahrenheit is being decreased from 7 days to 24 hours for water-solid conditions. The required
AOT for low temperature conditions, other than water-solid, will remain at 7 days with one RHR relief valve inoperable,
provided the pressurizer level is less than or equal to 30 percent and a dedicated operator is assigned to monitor and
control the reactor coolant system pressure.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment modifies the technical specifications (TS) to address new containment purge and vent valves to be installed
in the 1994 refueling outage. The amendment changes the containment purge and vent valve TS as follows: (1) removes
the requirement ensuring that valve position remains at less than or equal to 70 degrees, (2) changes the containment
leak testing requirements for the metal-to-metal seated valves from 6 months to 2 years since they have improved seat
designs, and (3) makes administrative changes to delete an out-of-date note, to relocate an action statement requirement
from the TS surveillance section to the TS action statement section, and to change a related TS reference to this surveillance
section. Valve opening position does not need to be limited to less than or equal to 70 degrees. The resiliently-seated
valves have a permanently installed mechanical stop to limit the open position to ensure adequate closure times.
The metal-to-metal seated valves are designed to close from the 90-degree open position.

Stephen Mignotte (Mr. Mignotte) held Senior Reactor Operator License No. SOP&hyph;11160 (License) issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55. The license authorized Mr. Mignotte
to manipulate, and to supervise the manipulation of, the controls of the nuclear power reactor at the New York Power
Authority's (Facility Licensee) Indian Point 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Buchanan, New York. On November 23, 1993, Mr.
Mignotte resigned his employment with the New York Power Authority, which caused the License to expire. Additionally,
the Facility Licensee, in a letter dated December 23, 1993, informed the NRC that the New York Power Authority no longer
had a need to maintain Mr. Mignotte's operating license for the Indian Point Unit 3 Nuclear Power Plant.

The responsibilities associated with a Senior Reactor Operator license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55 require
that individuals be fit for duty while performing safety-related activities at the facility. The character of the
individual, which includes the individual's trustworthiness, is a consideration in issuing an operator license.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182a of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2232a). In determining whether or not an individual
seeking a license to be a reactor operator or senior reactor operator has the necessary character and trustworthiness,
the Commission takes into account any history of illegal drug use by the applicant. Prior to May 26, 1987, each applicant
for a reactor operator or senior reactor operator license was required to certify that the applicant had no drug or
narcotic habit on the Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. Since that time, the NRC has required an evaluation
of the applicant prepared by a physician as part of a license application.

In accordance with 10 CFR Part 26, the Facility Licensee established a program to provide reasonable assurance that
nuclear power plant personnel are not under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal, which affects their
ability to safely and competently perform their duties, including measures for early detection of persons who are
not fit to perform licensed activities. In addition, licensed operators are required by 10 CFR 55.53(j) to refrain
from use of illegal drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. Licensed operators are also required by 10 CFR 55.53(k)
to participate in 10 CFR Part 26 fitness-for-duty programs established by the Facility Licensees.

On November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte, while on duty as a Senior Reactor Operator at the Indian Point 3 facility, was requested
by the Facility Licensee to provide a urine sample to the nurse at the plant after being randomly selected as part of
the routine fitness for duty chemical testing program required of the Facility Licensee by the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR
26.24. After receiving a sample from Mr. Mignotte, the nurse checked the temperature of the sample, noticed that it
felt ``cool to the touch'', and found that the temperature was below specifications in 10 CFR Part 26, Appendix A, &sect;2.4(g)(14),
for acceptable urine samples. As a result, Mr. Mignotte was requested to provide a witnessed urine sample to the Facility
Licensee in accordance with the same section of the Appendix. Mr. Mignotte provided a second sample which was subsequently
determined, on November 30, 1993, to contain both marijuana and cocaine above cutoff levels specified by the Appendix.
After the witnessed urine sample had been collected on November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte was suspended from licensed
duties and he subsequently resigned that same day. These facts were provided to the NRC by the Facility Licensee, in
letters dated December 23, 1993 and January 3, 1994, and were discussed in the report of an NRC inspection conducted
January 12&hyph;13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the second, witnessed urine sample indicate that Mr. Mignotte used illegal drugs, which is a violation
of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j). Furthermore, his performance of licensed duties while
under the influence of illegal drugs is also a violation of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j).
Based on the temperature of the first urine sample provided by Mr. Mignotte and the fact that the first sample yielded
negative results when tested for illegal substances while the subsequent, witnessed sample yielded positive results,
I conclude that the first sample was a surrogate false sample, submitted by Mr. Mignotte in an attempt to conceal illegal
drug use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) prohibits any employee of a licensee from deliberately submitting to the NRC, a licensee, or a licensee's
contractor or subcontractor, information that the person submitting the information knows to be incomplete or inaccurate
in some respect material to the NRC. The urine samples collected within the context of a licensee's chemical testing
program pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 26 represent information material to an access authorization
and fitness-for-duty decision. Therefore, Mr. Mignotte's deliberately submitting inaccurate information material
to the NRC in the form of a false sample is a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2). In addition, Mr. Mignotte violated 10 CFR
50.5(a)(1) by deliberately providing to the Facility Licensee a surrogate urine sample that he knew to be inaccurate
at the time he submitted it and which, but for detection, would have caused the Facility Licensee to be in violation
of 10 CFR 50.9(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Nignotte's failure to comply with the prohibition against illegal drug use and his attempts to circumvent the
chemical testing program to avoid detection of illegal drug use while employed by the Facility Licensee are violations
of the conditions of Mr. Mignotte's license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53 (j) and (k), and demonstrate an intentional disregard
for the important obligations of a licensed operator.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above, Mr. Mignotte, an employee of the New York Power Authority at the time of the incident, engaged in
deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(1) and (2) by deliberately violating 10 CFR 55.53(k), in that
he submitted to the facility licensee information which he knew to be inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC.
Mr. Mignotte, a licensed Senior Reactor Operator at the time of the event, also used illegal substances and performed
licensed duties while under the influence of illegal substances in violation of 10 CFR 55.53(j), and deliberately
failed to participate in the fitness-for-duty program established by the facility licensee in violation of 10 CFR
55.53(k).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC must be able to rely on its licensees and their employees, especially NRC-licensed operators, to comply with
NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information and maintain records that are complete and accurate
in all material respects. Mr. Mignotte's actions in using illegal drugs and attempting to circumvent fitness-for-duty
requirements have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements applicable
to licensed individuals and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that Mr. Mignotte will conduct any 10 CFR Part 55 licensed
activities in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected
with Mr. Mignotte engaged in such licensed activities at this time. Therefore, I find that the public health, safety,
and interest require that Mr. Mignotte be prohibited from involvement in 10 CFR Part 55 licensed activities for three
years from the date of this Order. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the misconduct
described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.

In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Mignotte must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this
Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically
admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Mr.
Mignotte or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued.
Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN:
Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement
at the same address; to the Regional Administrator, Region I, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 475 Allendale
Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406; and to Mr. Mignotte, if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Mignotte.
If a person other than Mr. Mignotte requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in
which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested by Mr. Mignotee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Mignotee or any person adversely affected, by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time that answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from
the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.

<DOCTITLE>Florida Power and Light Co. (Turkey Point and St. Lucie Nuclear Plants) Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision
Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1994, Thomas J. Saporito, Jr. filed a petition under 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's
regulations requesting that the NRC take action against Florida Power and Light Co. as operator of the Turkey Point
and St. Lucie nuclear power stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioner asks that the NRC institute a show cause proceeding to modify, suspend or revoke Florida Power and Light
Co.'s operating licenses and that the NRC take escalated enforcement action for retaliatory actions which were taken
against him, a former employee, for engaging in protected activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.7. Petitioner asks that
the NRC also take escalated enforcement action against every employee of the company who is found to have been involved
in the retaliatory actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to determine which Licensee employees were involved in the relatiatory actions and to assess the overall
work environment at the plants, Petitioner asks that the NRC conduct an investigation. In addition to the specific
acts of retaliation he claims were taken against him, the Petitioner alleges that other employees have also been retaliated
against, creating a chilling effect at the Turkey Point plant beginning in 1988. Petitioner asks that the NRC initiate
an investigation into his claims, which involve alleged violations of 10 CFR 50.7 and 19.15 and the Energy Reorganization
Act, notwithstanding the fact that they are being pursued within the Department of Labor, because of the asserted
public health and safety implications involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioner's request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206,
appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Co. Notice of Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM&hyph;2501</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2501
held by Virginia Electric and Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Surry ISFSI, located in
Surry County, Virginia. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment revises the Technical Specifications making procedural changes to spent fuel characteristics for
the CASTOR V/21 cask and allows use of the CASTOR X/33 cask at the site. These changes do not affect fuel receipt, handling,
and storage safety. They are procedural in nature and result in a change in process operations and equipment that does
not alter the scope and type of operations presently authorized. The safety evaluation for this amendment demonstrates
that the accident consequences for the analyzed design basis accidents remain negligible. There is reasonable assurance
that the public health and safety will remain protected by activities authorized under this amendment and that the
environmental impact will remain insignificant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as
required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license
amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant
hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental
impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance
of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applications for amendment dated December 23, 1988, May
3, 1991, and November 19, 1993, and (2) Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2501, and (3) the Commission's
letter to the licensee dated June 29, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the report of the National Performance Review (NPR) recommendation to convert the FAR from rigid rules
to guiding principles, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy has established a Board of Directors (hereinafter
the Board), comprised of senior level individuals from the Executive Branch, to develop a plan for the FAR rewrite.
This notice solicits public comment on two approaches for the rewrite, including drafting principles, the Board
is considering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both approaches delineate mandatory and nonmandatory provisions. The first approach would provide for (1) a FAR
that is limited to mandatory governmentwide regulations, and (2) an acquisition manual that would reprint the FAR
and also include nonmandatory governmentwide policies, procedures, etc. In addition, agency supplements, including
both mandatory and nonmandatory provisions, would be authorized to implement agency-unique statutes, policies,
etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second approach would consist of (1) the FAR which would include all mandatory Governmentwide provisions, and
(2) separate acquisition manuals developed by an agency or a group of agencies. The manuals would include mandatory
provisions necessary to implement statutes unique to the agency or group of agencies, a minimal number of mandatory
policies and procedures not required by statute, and nonmandatory guidance.

Both approaches would result in a FAR containing only mandatory provisions. However, the first approach would promulgate
governmentwide nonregulation guidance, while the second approach would permit an agency to promulgate in agency
manuals whatever nonregulation guidance the agency deems appropriate. Additionally, the first approach would
retain agency FAR supplements, while the second approach would replace agency supplements with agency acquisition
manuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has prepared a model rewrite of FAR Part 9 to illustrate the first approach. It is drafted as a governmentwide
manual containing both the new FAR (which will also be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations); and policies,
procedures, provisions, forms, and clauses that do not constitute regulations. An actual FAR rewrite would likely
include a wider variety of options and illustrations than appear in the nonregulation component of the model. This
notice solicits comments only on the proposed approach for the FAR rewrite, and not on the content of the model rewrite
of Part 9.

The Board intends to provide for a mutual exchange of ideas and information with affected parties both in the government
and the private sector by publishing this notice, soliciting public comments, and holding a public meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the NPR which required simplification of the procurement
process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid rules to guiding principles. According to the report, the FAR, which
is the government's principal set of procurement regulations, is too process oriented, changes too often, minimizes
discretion of procurement officials, and stifles innovation. The Board intends to develop a plan to rewrite the FAR
to move from a system of rigid rules to guiding principles, promote decision making at the lowest possible level, eliminate
unnecessary regulatory requirements, facilitate innovative contracting and develop a more effective process
to listen to its customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This project will be accomplished under the direction of the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy with the
assistance of a Board of Directors comprised of senior-level officials from the Executive Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has begun planning the FAR rewrite project by defining two approaches and by drafting a model FAR Part 9 that
adheres, for the most part, to the drafting principles outlined in this announcement as the first approach. However,
if the FAR is actually rewritten along the lines of the model, we expect that there would be additional material and
more than one optional approach or illustration to be included in many parts of the nonregulation part of the model.
The Board intends to recommend adoption of the NPR philosophy of giving greater flexibility in the formulation and
administration of contracts.

Questions for Commentors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist the Board in its deliberations, it is requested that all interested parties review the proposed approaches,
drafting principles, and illustration of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. This notice solicits comments on the proposed
approaches for the FAR rewrite and not on the content of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. In preparing comments the Board
requests that commentors consider the following questions with regard to each approach:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does the proposed approach represent an improvement to the existing FAR system? If not, please suggest an alternative
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the proposed approach remove from the regulations system unnecessary, burdensome direction while still
providing the procurement community with sufficient common policy and principles? If not, please suggest an alternative
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the proposed approach increase discretion and encourage innovation while still fostering good contracting
practices? If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Does the proposed approach simplify the procurement process? If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Does the approach of publishing nonregulation information in an acquisition manual provide useful guidance for
contracting officers in decision making, formulating process or practical solutions, identifying alternatives?
If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Does the proposed approach for the Code of Federal Regulations to contain only the regulation component of the model
raise any concerns for you? If so, please suggest an alternative approach.

8. Which types or categories of provisions and clauses would you recommend to be included in the regulation component
of the model? In the nonregulation manual component of the model?

9. Does the proposed approach to include only guidance needed by procurement personnel improve the contracting process?
If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Is there a better approach for rewriting the FAR? What is it?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

First Proposed Approach

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic thrust of this approach under consideration by the Board is to divide the FAR into regulation and nonregulation
(a Governmentwide manual) components. The new FAR will essentially retain its current 53 Part structure and will
contain policies, provisions and clauses necessary to implement statutory requirements, primary regulation requirements,
basic policies/guiding principles and essential governmentwide procedures. Much of the material, provisions
and clauses that will be removed from the FAR will be made available in nonregulation remarks in a Federal acquisition
manual. In addition, agencies will continue to issue supplements to the FAR, including minimal mandatory as well
as nonmandatory provisions. The FAR will be mandatory for use by the agencies, and will be codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government acquisition manual will include the FAR text, and in addition, will provide nonmandatory guidance,
alternative approaches, forms, clauses, and other examples that may be used, at their discretion, by contracting
officers in structuring a procurement. The nonregulation material in the manual will be published for public comment
only when required by Section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), which does not require
publication of the type of information normally provided nonregulation component of the acquisition manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR system will promote decision making at the lowest practicable level by permitting contracting officers to
use, modify, tailor to best suit individual situations or disregard nonregulation policies, procedures, provisions,
forms and clauses. For example, in the illustration of a new FAR Part 9, the clauses covering First Article Approval,
Contractor Testing, (FAR 52.209&hyph;3) would be eliminated from the regulation component but would be included
in the nonregulation component.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Drafting Principles_Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Include in the FAR statements of general policy, standards, forms, provisions, and clauses that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Are required by, or reasonably necessary to implement Statutes, Executive Orders, OMB Circulars, OFPP Policy
Letters, and, as appropriate, case law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The FAR Council or joint FAR signatories decide must have governmentwide application because consistency is essential
to maintain an effective and efficient acquisition system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Do not include in the FAR:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Procedures, policies, provisions or clauses which are not essential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Guidance that is not needed by procurement personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Include in the acquisition manual_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Examples of various optional methods for compliance with FAR policies, provisions, and clauses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Procedures, practices, forms provisions, and clauses that may be used, modified, or not used, at the discretion
of the Contracting Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Drafting Principles_General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Clearly identify the statutory requirements, basic policies, and principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Avoid proscription and rigid rules in favor of setting forth guiding principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Use goals and expected outcomes in place of processes or procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Assume the reader is a procurement professional with appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities to do the job.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Assume contractors and contracting officials are going to do the ``right thing.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Assign responsibility for decisions to the lowest practicable level, giving contracting officers authority,
responsibility, and maximum flexibility to find the most efficient, cost-effective way to meet customer mission
needs and time frames.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Minimize administrative and paperwork burdens on contracting officials and contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Include in the FAR references to procurement related statutes and regulations, such as labor laws, and small business
size standards. Provide, as appropriate, in the acquisition manual, necessary additional information to assist
the contracting officers in complying with those requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Provide guidance that encourages sound business practices, streamline the contracting process, contributes
to increased productivity, and cost effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Provide guidance that implements policies based on statute without just restating the law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Avoid guidance and other controls that impose unnecessary dollar thresholds, approval levels, contractor certifications,
coordination and documentation requirements, determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Provide guidance that offers maximum opportunity for innovative contracting approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Avoid the creation of regulations to address every contracting contingency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Provide guidance to contracting officers that encourages risk management rather than risk avoidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Avoid regulations that impose government-unique, unnecessary requirements on federal contractors. Promote
the acquisition of commercial products and reliance on the commercial marketplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Apply a consistent set of drafting conventions so that the FAR will be succinct and understandable to the general
reader.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Second Proposed Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second approach is essentially the same as the first approach with respect to which material would be regulations
and which material would be provided in a nonregulation acquisition manual. However, the nonregulation material
would not be published as a governmentwide manual. Rather, each agency, or group of agencies would be authorized to
publish its own manual containing its own guidance. These manuals would contain a minimal amount of mandatory material
applicable to the internal operations of the agency or necessary to implement the statutes that apply to that agency
or group of agencies. The remainder of the material in the manual would be that as noted in the first approach as nonregulation
in nature and not mandatory. Thus the FAR system would be comprised of the FAR (regulations) and agency acquisition
manuals (nonmandatory guidance and minimal mandatory requirements) that would take the place of current agency
supplements.

Illustration of the First Proposed Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Model of revised Part 9. The model FAR Part 9 is provided in the appendix to illustrate the first approach being considered
by the Board. Comment only on the approach illustrated by this model rewrite, and not on the content of the model rewrite
on Part 9. FAR Part 9 will be submitted to a committee for revisions in accordance with these Drafting Principles once
the Drafting Principles have been approved. The following model rewrite of FAR Part 9 shows the governmentwide acquisition
manual as it would appear under proposed number one.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed approach number two would follow the same criteria as is followed under proposed approach one to determine
which material is to be codified in the CFR and which material is to appear in nonregulation guidance. However, under
proposed approach number two, the nonregulation guidance would be published by individual agencies in manuals that
apply to contracts issued by that agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 3, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34133 (May 31, 1994), 59 FR 29308 (June
6, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex is amending Section 140 of its Listing Standards and Requirements relating to the fees charged to listed companies
for the original listing of common stock. Specifically, the Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee
applicable to the original listing of stock issues on the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the listing fee for stock issues ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares to more
than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already have
securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers listed
on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50 percent of the rates for U.S. companies, including the $5,000 one-time
charge, with a maximum of $30,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee of $45,000 ($50,000 inclusive of the one-time charge of
$5,000) for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares. In addition, the Exchange is reducing the maximum listing fee
for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from $30,000 to $25,000, inclusive of the one-time charge.

Section 140 is amended to require the following fees:

Less than 1 million shares_$5,000
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&blank;1+&hyph;&blank;2 million shares_$10,000

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&blank;7+&hyph;&blank;8 million shares_$27,500
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15+&blank;&blank;&blank; million shares_$45,000
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above per-share fee, there is a one-time charge of $5,000 for companies that do not have a stock or
warrant issue listed on the Exchange. (The one-time charge of $5,000 does not apply to any company which previously
paid the one-time charge in connection with the listing of a debt issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges, the fee, including the one-time charge, is 50%
of the rates set forth above, with a maximum fee of $25,000. Where the original listing of more than one class of stock
is included in the same application, the fee is based on the aggregate number of shares of all such classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes, based upon discussions with prospect companies, that each year several large companies elect
not to list on the Amex due to the expense of the Exchange's listing fee at the upper end of the fee schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 More specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the
Act which requires that the rules of an exchange assure the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other
charges among members, issuers, and other persons using its facilities. The Commission believes that the reduced
original listing fees for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares are not unfairly discriminatory as proscribed
by Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that adopting a maximum original listing fee for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares
is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in attracting
large companies for listing with its regulatory interests in listing only bona fide companies on the Exchange. For
example, although decreasing listing fees for issues over 15 million shares should attract additional larger issuers
to its market, as well as provide an incentive for current Exchange issuers to list their new issues on the Amex, the
fee amendment will not affect the Amex's quantitative criteria for listing stock on the Exchange. Moreover, the adoption
of a maximum fee provides for a more equitable allocation of listing fees among issuers and should eliminate any disincentive
for large issuers to list on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also believes that reducing the maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock for non-U.S.
companies listed on foreign stock exchanges from $30,000 to $25,000 (inclusive of the $5,000 one-time charge) is
consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in view of the reduction in fees for U.S. companies with issues exceeding
15 million shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approved the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;12) is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Designatronics Incorporated, Common
Stock, $.04 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;8543</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
June 29, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designatronics Incorporated (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on June 2, 1994,
to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According
to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility
and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist on the Amex; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's shareholders more liquidity than is
presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Company believes that the NASD/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group
of market makers and expand the capital base available for trading in the Common Stock; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Company believes that the firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASD/NMS system will also
be inclined to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional
research and advisory reports.

Any interested person may, on or before July 21, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars not originally

U.S.-certified versions of the 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4), and they are capable of being readily modified

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. &sect;1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Liphardt &amp; Associates, Inc. of Ronkonkoma, New York (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;004) petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into
the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 19748) to afford an opportunity for
public comment. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. The petition covers
both the 2-wheel drive Carrera 2 and the 4-wheel drive Carrera 4. The notice referred collectively to these vehicles
as the ``1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2/4.'' No comments were received in response to the notice. Based on its review of
the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HOPE for Elderly Independence Program is intended to demonstrate that effectively targeted and tailored supportive
services, coupled with tenant-based rental voucher assistance, can help frail elderly persons continue to live
independently in a cost efficient way and prevent premature or unnecessary institutionalization. Effective delivery
of supportive services is the critical element in a successful program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive services for the frail elderly are coordinated by a PHA through a service coordinator and a professional
assessment committee (PAC). The PAC is competent to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons with
respect to the performance of normal daily living activities. The service coordinator is skilled and trained in dealing
with the frail elderly, is a member of the PAC, and is responsible for assuring, through case management, that program
participants are linked to the supportive services they need to continue independent living. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A service coordinator's training, educational, and work experiences must meet the following minimum guidelines:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A Bachelor of Social Work or degree in a related field such as gerontology, psychology or counseling is preferable;
a college degree is fully acceptable. However, individuals without a degree but with appropriate work experience
may be hired. A PHA may hire a person without a degree, with appropriate justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The service coordinator must be trained in the aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility
for and procedures of federal and applicable State entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing
service coordination, drug and alcohol use and abuse by the elderly, and mental health issues. This requirement is
not a prerequisite for hiring. However, training requirements, if not met at the point of hiring, must be satisfied
within one year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Two years of experience in social services delivery with senior citizens or demonstrated working knowledge of
supportive services and other resources for senior citizens in the jurisdiction where the demonstration is located.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to advocate, problem-solve and provide results for the elderly served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Demonstrated writing and organizational skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A service coordinator performs the following functions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Consults with frail elderly tenants, service providers, owners and other appropriate persons to identify the
particular needs and characteristics of frail elderly persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Builds professional relationships with agencies, service providers and volunteers in the community to secure
ongoing provision of supportive services and other necessary items for the program. Shops to determine the best value
in service pricing to assure individualized, flexible and creative services for the frail elderly. May set up a directory
of service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Screens applicants for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program, reviews any comments from applicants' physicians
and the adequacy of applicants' informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the applicant to
assist in meeting daily living needs), conducts preliminary assessments of frailty, refers potentially eligible
applicants to the PAC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Educates program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability, and client rights
providing advocacy as appropriate. Assists participants in making their own choices, refers and links participants
to service providers. These are, for example, case management, personal assistance, homemaker assistance, meals-on-wheels,
transportation, counseling, occasional visiting nurses, preventive health screening and legal advocacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Helps build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family, with the objective to provide only
those services necessary to maintain independence and to avoid dependence. If necessary, assists participants
with the decision to move to a higher level of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Ensures that the services included in participants' case plans are provided on a regular, ongoing and satisfactory
basis. Completes and maintains case files for the PAC including records of assessments, case plans, referrals, case

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications must contain the following information stated in a letter from the Executive Director of the PHA
to the Director of the Public Housing Division in the local HUD State or Area Office (see sample letter format, Attachment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The total number of HOPE for Elderly Independence Program participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The dollar amount of any PHA matching funds for supportive services costs under the HOPE for Elderly Independence
Program that is attributable to the costs of a service coordinator. If funds are received under this NOFA to pay service
coordinator costs that were formerly part of the PHA's required match, that dollar value match must be replaced with
payment for other additional supportive services costs. The PHA's application must identify any replacement supportive
services and their costs, and include firm written commitments from the service providers for at least the first year's
funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The annual salary proposed for the service coordinator, plus any fringe benefits and administrative costs (e.g.,
additional office equipment, supplies, car allowance, copying, training, etc.) for the first year, the amounts
needed for years two through five, and the total amount requested for the complete five year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service coordinator salary should be based on the following formula: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine the salary level, taking into consideration salaries for comparable jobs, modified by the hours worked.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Set the annual salary, including any fringe benefits that pertain to the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) List first year administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Set the total cost for year one: Annual salary, plus first year administrative costs, equals total cost for the
first year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The estimates for years two through five (or less) may be based on an annual inflation factor of up to five percent.
Any one-time, first-year start-up costs should be subtracted from the year one administrative cost before calculating
the year two through five estimates.

certification. Such evidence includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A pending civil rights suit against the PHA, referred by the Department's General Counsel and instituted by the
Department of Justice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Outstanding HUD findings of PHA noncompliance with civil rights statutes, regulations and executive orders,
as a result of formal administrative proceedings, unless the PHA is implementing a HUD-approved tenant selection
and assignment plan and a voluntary compliance agreement designed to correct the areas of noncompliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A deferral of the processing of applications from the PHA imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of

(HUD Handbook 8040.1), or under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD implementing regulations (24
CFR 8.57); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A pending proceeding against the PHA based upon a Charge of Discrimination issued under the Fair Housing Act. A
Charge of discrimination is a Charge under Section 810(g)(2) of the Fair Housing Act, issued by the Department's General
Counsel or legally authorized designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) There is an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual;

noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the event that the validity of a civil rights certification is drawn into question the application is eligible
to be funded, but the PHA may not draw down funds until it has satisfied any outstanding civil rights issues.

IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HUD State or Area Office will screen all applications and notify applicants of technical deficiencies by letter.
Since the funds available under this NOFA are not being awarded on a competitive basis, a technical deficiency would
be a significant discrepancy in information supplied by the applicant and information available to HUD, or the omission
or the incomplete submission of any of the items required to be submitted in the application. These are listed in section
III. of this NOFA, Checklist of Application Submission Requirements, above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant
of any technical deficiency. Information received after 3:00 p.m., local time, on the fourteenth calendar day of
the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be rejected as being incomplete.

V. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's
regulations at 24, CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in
the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room
10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.

(b) Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the provisions of this NOFA do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA
makes funds available for PHAs to employ or otherwise retain the services of up to one service coordinator for a period
of up to five years in conjunction with the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program. As such, there are no direct implications
on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among various levels of government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the policies announced in this Notice would not have a significant impact on the formation, maintenance,
and general well-being of families except indirectly to the extent of the social and other benefits expected from
this program of assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign
power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from
the statute's coverage.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to
influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those
who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking
of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912) as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule.
