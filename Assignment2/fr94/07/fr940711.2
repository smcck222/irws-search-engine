SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NAFTA Implementation Act authorizes the imposition of a temporary duty (snapback) for Mexican frozen concentrated
orange juice when certain conditions exist. Mexican articles falling under subheading 2009.11.00 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are subject to the snapback duty provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 309(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, certain price conditions must exist before the United States
can apply a snapback duty on imports of Mexican frozen concentrated orange juice. In addition, such imports must exceed
specified quantities before the snapback duty can be applied. The price conditions exist when for each period of 5
consecutive business days the daily price for frozen concentrated orange juice is less than the trigger price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this provision, the term ``daily price'' means the daily closing price of the New York Cotton Exchange,
or any successor as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture (the ``Exchange''), for the closest month in which
contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice are being traded on the Exchange. The term ``business day'' means
a day in which contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice are being traded on the Exchange. The term ``trigger
price'' means the average daily closing price of the Exchange for the corresponding month during the previous 5-year
period, excluding the year with the highest average price for the corresponding month and the year with the lowest
average price for the corresponding month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Price conditions no longer exist when the Secretary determines that for a period of 5 consecutive business days the
daily price for frozen concentrated orange juice has exceeded the trigger price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever the price conditions are determined to exist or to cease to exist the Secretary is required to immediately
notify the Commissioner of Customs of such determination. Whenever the determination is that the price conditions
exist and the quantity of Mexican articles of frozen concentrated orange juice entered exceeds (1) 264,978,000 liters
(single strength equivalent) in any of calendar years 1994 through 2002, or (2) 340,560,000 liters (single strength
equivalent) in any of calendar years 2003 through 2007, the rate of duty on Mexican articles of frozen concentrated
orange juice that are entered after the date on which the applicable quantity limitation is reached and before the
date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the determination that the price conditions have ceased to exist shall be the lower of_(1) the column 1_General
rate of duty in effect for such articles on July 1, 1991; or (2) the column 1_General rate of duty in effect on that day.
For the purpose of this provision, the term ``entered'' means entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption
in the customs territory of the United States.

A critical component in conducting a census is a current and accurate address list of all living quarters. The Census
Bureau will use two primary methods to create and update its address files: precanvass in urban areas (enumerators
systematically canvass census blocks to verify or update addresses on the census address list) and prelist in rural
areas (enumerators systematically canvass census blocks to obtain the physical location address and/or the mailing
address of all structures where people live or could live). In addition to these methods the Census Bureau will receive
additional address update information from outside sources including the United States Postal Service, local governments,
and the ``Be Counted!'' campaign. The added addresses from these outside sources will be field verified to confirm
their existence before being added to the census address list. The 1995 Census Test &hyph; Field Verification Operation
will help verify the accuracy and completeness of the Census Bureau's address control file that we will use for the
delivery of census test questionnaires.

Respondents and Status of Questionnaires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 11 and 12, 1994, the Department received information from MOFTEC and the American Embassy in Beijing, respectively,
containing the names and addresses of 40 producers/exporters of the subject merchandise in the PRC. Based on an analysis
of ships' manifest data (PIERS), the Department estimated that the named respondents accounted for approximately
40 percent of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation. Consequently,
on May 18, 1994, the Department sent 40 antidumping questionnaires to the named firms, with additional copies sent
to MOFTEC and the China Chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following an entry of appearance by counsel for a previously unnamed producer/exporter, the Department sent a questionnaire
to this additional firm on May 31, 1994. Finally, at the request of a second previously unnamed producer/exporter,
the Department sent a questionnaire to this additional firm on June 21, 1994.

Other Events

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 2, 1994, the Department issued a decision memorandum which stated that we would not postpone our preliminary
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on reasonably supported allegations submitted by petitioner on June 10, 1994, the Department initiated an
investigation on June 14, 1994, of whether critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from
the PRC. On June 14 and 21, 1994, the Department requested monthly shipment data for exports to the United States from
questionnaire recipients.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves,
whether or not peeled, fresh, chilled, frozen, provisionally preserved, or packed in water or other neutral substance,
but not prepared or preserved by the addition of other ingredients or heat processing. The differences between grades
are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subject merchandise is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. The subject garlic is currently classifiable
under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, 0710.80.9750, 0711.90.6000, and 2005.90.9500 of the

 (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope description provided above differs from the scope description used by the Department in its notice of initiation
of this investigation (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994). Changes to the scope include (a) the addition of more concise
language (and additional HTS subheadings) related to the packing of the subject merchandise, and (b) additional
language to exclude further processed products. The revisions are a result of comments received from the Customs
Service on March 17 and June 30, 1994, and from counsel for petitioner on June 29 and 30, 1994.

Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA)
is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise in this investigation. In deciding whether to use BIA, section
776(c) provides that the Department may take into account whether the respondent was able to produce information
requested in a timely manner and in the form required. In this case, exporters of fresh garlic from the PRC did not respond
to our requests for information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As outlined in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, the Department made several attempts to obtain information
from a number of sources. We have not received any responses to our questionnaire with which to perform our antidumping
analysis. Consequently, we based our preliminary determination in this investigation on BIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperate in an investigation, and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who do not cooperate in an investigation. Since the potential respondents in this case have
not cooperated, we assigned a BIA margin based on the most adverse assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, BIA is the highest margin contained in the petition (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994), and is listed below for all manufacturers, producers and exporters of fresh garlic
in the PRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. Section
733(e)(1) of the Act provides that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist
if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of investigation at less than its fair value, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding criterion (A) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more as sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping. Since the preliminary estimated dumping margin for all exporters of fresh garlic in the PRC is in excess
of 25 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping under section 733(e)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding criterion (B) above, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f), we generally consider the following factors in determining
whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) the volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal
trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. If imports during
the period immediately following the petition increase by 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately
preceding the filing of a petition, we consider them massive. Respondents have failed to respond to the Department's
questionnaire, as well as to our request for monthly export data. As a result, the Department has assumed, as BIA, that
there have been massive imports over a relatively short period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, because the dumping margin is sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping, and because we have determined
that imports of fresh garlic have been massive, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances do exist
in this investigation.

In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of fresh garlic from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date 90 days before the date of publication of
this notice in the

the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 21&hyph;3, COBOL, which adopts ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985,
and ANSI X3.23a 1989, is being proposed for Federal use. This revision will adopt the forthcoming amendment (ANSI
X3.23b&hyph;1993) to American National Standard for COBOL which adds corrections and clarification to the language.
The proposed amendment is upwardly compatible with the current standard except for the reserved word FUNCTION.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard COBOL, as specified in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985,
X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23b&hyph;1993, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) This revision
supersedes FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 and reflects corrections and clarifications to the COBOL specifications. The American
National Standards define the elements of the COBOL programming language and the rules for their use. The purpose
of the standards is to promote portability of COBOL programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standards
are used by implementors as the reference authority in developing processors and by users who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard language.

Objectives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more
effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary
objectives of Federal programming language standards are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications and programs
that are either developed or acquired for government use. FIPS COBOL is one of the high level programming language
standards provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS COBOL is especially suited for applications
that emphasize the manipulation of characters, records, files, and input/output (in contrast to those primarily
concerned with scientific and numeric computations).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. The use of FIPS high level programming languages is strongly recommended when one or more of the following situations
exist:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
_It is anticipated that the life of the program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of
different makes, models and configurations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program will or might be run on equipment other than for which the program is initially written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through
the use of this high level language regardless of interchange potential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (i.e., State and local governments,
and others).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Nonstandard language features should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot reasonably be implemented
with the standard features alone. Although nonstandard language features can be very useful, it should be recognized
that their use may make the interchange of programs and future conversion to a revised standard or replacement processor
more difficult and costly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. It is recognized that programmatic requirements may be more economically and efficiently satisfied through the
use of report generation, database management, or text processing languages. The use of any facility should be considered
in the context of system life, system cost, data integrity, and the potential for data sharing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Programmatic requirements may be also more economically and efficiently satisfied by the use of automatic program
generators. However, if the final output of a program generator is a COBOL source program, then the resulting program
should conform to the conditions and specifications of FIPS COBOL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. When it is determined that a programming language that has been adopted as a FIPS is to be used for an application or
program, a processor conforming to the FIPS programming language shall be used, if available. It is not intended that
existing programs be rewritten solely for the purpose of conforming to a FIPS programming language. If a program is
to be part of an existing application written in a programming language not conforming to a FIPS, the language processor
used for the existing application may be used for the new program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FIPS COBOL specifications are the same as American National Standard COBOL as specified in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985,
ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23b&hyph;1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985, ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1993 specify the form of a program written in
COBOL, formats for data, and rules for program and data interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards do not specify limits on the size of programs, minimum system requirements, the means of supervisory
control of programs, or the means of transforming programs internally for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the following requirements apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For purposes of FIPS COBOL, the modules defined in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985 and ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1989 are combined
into three subsets and four optional modules. The three subsets are identified as Minimum, Intermediate, and High.
The four optional modules are Report Writer, Communication, Debug, and Segmentation. These four optional modules
may be associated with any of the subsets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The high subset is composed of all language elements of the highest level of all required modules. The intermediate
subset is composed of all language elements of level 1 of all required modules except the Intrinsic Function module.
The minimum subset is composed of all language elements of level 1 of the Nucleus, Sequential I&hyph;O, and Inter-Program
Communication modules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table reflects the composition of the required subsets and the relationship of the subsets and the optional
modules. The numbers in the table refer to the level within a module as designated in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985 and ANSI
X3.23A&hyph;1989, and a dash denotes the corresponding module is omitted or may be omitted.

b. A facility must be available in the processor for the user to optionally specify monitoring of the source program
at compile time. The monitoring may be specified for a FIPS COBOL subset, for any of the optional modules, for all of
the obsolete language elements included in the processor, or for a combination of a FIPS COBOL subset, optional modules,
and all obsolete elements. The monitoring may be specified for any FIPS COBOL subset at or below the highest subset
for which the processor is implemented and for a level of an optional module at or below the level of the optional module
for which the processor is implemented. The monitoring is an analysis of the syntax used in the source program against
the syntax included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules. Any syntax used in the source program
that does not conform to that included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules will be diagnosed
and identified to the user through a message on the source program listing. Any syntax for an obsolete language element
included in the processor and used in the source program will also be diagnosed and identified through a message on
the source program listing. The determination of the need to flag any given source program syntax in accordance with
these requirements cannot be logically resolved until the syntactic correctness of the source program has been established.

Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The implementation of FIPS COBOL involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of COBOL processors, interpretation
of FIPS COBOL, and validation of COBOL processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.1&blank;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acquisition of COBOL Processors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This publication is effective [insert a date 90 days after the approval date]. COBOL processors acquired for Federal
use after this date should implement at least one of the required subsets of FIPS COBOL. If the functionality of one
or more of the optional modules meets programmatic requirements, then those optional modules also should be acquired.
Each optional module that is needed to meet programmatic requirements should be explicitly cited as a requirement
in the order for the processor. Conformance to FIPS COBOL should be considered whether COBOL processors are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transition period provides time for industry to produce COBOL processors conforming to the standard. The transition
period begins on the effective date and continues for one (1) year thereafter. The following apply during the transition
period:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The provisions of FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 apply to processors ordered before the effective date but delivered subsequent
to the effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The provisions of this publication apply to orders placed after the effective date; however, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 21&hyph;4, if available, may be acquired for use prior to the effective date. If a conforming processor
is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 may be acquired for interim use during the transition
period.

Waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement-sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 119, Ada, will adopt the revised voluntary
industry specifications, American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization
Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, as a Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS). American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference
Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, specifies the form and meaning of programs written
in Ada. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of Ada programs for use on a variety of data processing
systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters,
or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and state and local governments.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with
the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.
Interested parties may obtain copies of the technical specifications from the Standards Processing Coordinator
(ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, Room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899,

Announcing the Standard for Ada
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Name of Standard. Ada (FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Programming Language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Explanation. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 119 and supersedes that document in its entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization
Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, as a Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS). American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference
Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, specifies the form and meaning of programs written
in Ada. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of Ada programs for use on a variety of data processing
systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters,
or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

8. Objectives. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies
to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources.
The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard language specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications that are either
developed or acquired for government use. FIPS Ada is one of the high level programming language standards provided
for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS Ada is suitable for use in programming and any applications for
which there is no specific language available specifically targeted to that application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The use of FIPS Ada is recommended for the following applications and situations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Those involving control of real-time or parallel processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Very large systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Systems with requirements for very high reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Systems which are to be developed with reusable software packages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_When it is anticipated that the life of an application will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of
different makes, models and configurations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

_The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through
the use of this high level language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (i.e., State and local governments,
and others).

10. Specifications. FIPS Ada specifications are the language specifications contained in American National Standard
and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC
8652:1994 standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the
Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994 standard document specifies the form of a program written in Ada,
the effect of translating and executing a program, predefined library entities that must be supplied, and detection
of compilation and/or link errors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard does not specify limits on the size or complexity of programs, the results when the rules of the standard
fail to establish an interpretation, the means of supervisory control of programs, or the means of transforming programs
for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Implementation. The implementation of FIPS Ada involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition
of Ada processors, interpretation of FIPS Ada, and validation of processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.1&blank;Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective ninety (90) days after the publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Ada Processors acquired for Federal use after this date should
conform to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transition period provides time for industry to produce Ada language processors conforming to the standard. The
transition period begins on the effective date and ends March 1, 1997. The provisions of FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1 apply
to orders placed after the effective date of this publication. If, during the transition period, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1 is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 119 may be acquired for interim use during
the transition period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This transition period is intended to give implementations that conform to FIPS PUB 119 time to make the enhancements
necessary to enable conformance to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1. No further transitional period is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.2&blank;Acquisition of Ada Processors. Conformance to FIPS Ada should be considered whether Ada processors
are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used
under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology
for procurement of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp;
Telecommunications Standards Index, Chapter 4 Part 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.3&blank;Interpretation of FIPS Ada. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution
of questions (see FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 29 October 1992) regarding the
specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation
of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS Ada Interpretation,
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, FAX:
301&hyph;948&hyph;6213, e-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.4&blank;Validation of Ada Processors. Implementations of FIPS Ada shall be validated in accordance with the
NIST Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS Ada. Recommended procurement terminology
for validation of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation,
Prior Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option and shall
specify whether a Validation Summary Report or Certificate of Validation is required. The agency shall specify appropriate
time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Validated Products List 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for information about the validation status of Ada products. This information may be used to specify validation time
frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate
is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the Ada implementation offered. The criteria for applicability
of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require
that the offered version/release of the Ada implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software
environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter
settings; e.g., the same parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve
waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may re-delegate such authority
only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only
when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government wide savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room
B&hyph;154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), shall be part
of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), is being proposed.
This proposed revision corrects a technical flaw that made the standard less secure than had been thought. The algorithm
is still reliable as a security mechanism, but the correction returns the SHS to the original level of security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SHS produces a 160-bit output called a message digest for a message of any size. This message digest can be used with
FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), to compute a signature for the message. The same message digest should
be obtained by the verifier of the signature when the received version of the message is used as input to the Secure Hash
Algorithm (SHA). Any change to the message in transmit should produce a different message digest, indicating to the
verifier that a change has been made to the message.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, state, and local government
users prior to submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) specifications which deal with the technical aspects of
the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interest parties may obtain
copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards
and Technology, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Name of Standard: Secure Hash Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category of Standard: Computer Security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Explanation: This Standard specifies a secure hash algorithm, SHA&hyph;1, for computing a condensed representation
of a message or a data file. When a message of any length &lt;2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bits is input, the SHA&hyph;1 produces a 160-bit output called a message digest. The message digest can then be input
to the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which generates or verifies the signature for the message (see Figure 1).
Signing the message digest rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process because the message
digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The same hash algorithm must be used by the verifier of a digital
signature as was used by the creator of the digital signature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SHA&hyph;1 is called secure because it is computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a
given message digest, or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest. Any change to a message
in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and the signature will fail to verify.
SHA&hyph;1 is a technical revision of SHA (FIPS 180). A circular left shift operation has been added to the specifications
in section 7, line b, page 9 of FIPS 180 and its equivalent in section 8, line c, page 10 of FIPS 180.* This revision improves
the security provided by this standard. The SHA&hyph;1 is based on principles similar to those used by Professor Ronald
L. Rivest of MIT when designing the MD4 message:

c. Encourage the adoption and use of the specified secure hash algorithm by private and commercial organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualifications: While it is the intent of this standard to specify a secure hash algorithm, conformance to this standard
does not assure that a particular implementation is secure. The responsible authority in each agency or department
shall assure that an overall implementation provides an acceptable level of security. This standard will be reviewed
every five years in order to assess its adequacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waiver Procedure: Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve
waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority
only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. Waiver shall be granted
only when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Compliance with a standard would cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide
savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standing cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room
B&hyph;154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any accompanying documents,
with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 United States Code Section 552(b), shall
be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) develops fire safety standards which are known collectively as
the National Fire Codes. Federal agencies frequently use these standards as the basis for developing Federal regulations
concerning fire safety. Often, the Office of the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 approves the incorporation by reference of these standards under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Standards developed by the technical committees of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) have been used
by various Federal Agencies as the basis for Federal regulations concerning fire safety. The NFPA standards are known
collectively as the National Fire Codes. Often, the Office of the Federal Register approves the incorporation by
reference of these standards under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions of existing standards and adoption of new standards are reported by the technical committees at the NFPA's
Fall Meeting in November or at the Annual Meeting in May each year. The NFPA invites public comment on its Report on Proposals.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Federal Register on January 20, 1994 (59 FR 3072), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (``NIST''),
U.S. Department of Commerce, issued a notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that
NIST was contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the United States to practice the invention embodied in
U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176, titled ``Method and Apparatus for Precisely Measuring Voltages Applied to X-Ray Sources''
to Radcal Corporation, having a place of Business in Monrovia, California. In the course of negotiations with Radcal
Corporation, additional matters have arisen which may affect the prospective license, and which NIST wishes to bring
to the attention of potential respondents through this notice.

 on June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34568), CITA announces that Customs would be conducting other investigations of transshipments
of textiles produced in China and exported to the United States. Based on these investigations, the U.S. Customs Service
has determined that textile products in Categories 339 and 352, produced or manufactured in China and entered into
the United States with the incorrect country of origin, were transshipped in circumvention of the Memorandum of Understanding
dated January 17, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China. Consultations
were held between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China on this matter on June 9 through
10, 1994. Accordingly, in the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to
charge the following amounts to the 1994 quota levels for the categories listed below:

to the Silk Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes dated June 23, 1994 and June 27, 1994, between the Governments
of the United States and the People's Republic of China; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651
of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on July 15, 1994, entry into the Customs territory
of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption

which the Government of the People's Republic of China has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below.
Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement or become
subject to import quotas, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement

license will be printed on a purple guilloche pattern background. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate
copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into
the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each visa stamp shall include the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for China is ``CN''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying
the shipment; e.g., 4CN123456.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTS or successor documents) shall be reported in the spaces provided within the visa stamp (e.g., ``Cat. 340&hyph;510
DOZ'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise
may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the
actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise,
the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature,
category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in
any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the
quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered
shall be charged to any applicable quota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the People's Republic of China,
replacement visa issued by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., or a visa waiver may be
issued by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements at the request of the Embassy of the People's
Republic of China in Washington, D.C., and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment
will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive
the quota requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The replacement visa shall consist of a Textile Export Visa/Invoice form bearing an official Chinese Embassy embossed
stamp on the front and include the standard information required on an export visa and the signature of an official
authorized by the Government of the People's Republic of China to issue replacement visas. The signature must match
one of two original signatures of authorized officials provided to the Government of the United States by the Government
of the People's Republic of China. U.S. Customs shall not permit entry of the shipment if any of the information required
on the replacement visa is missing, incorrect or illegible, or has been crossed out or altered in any way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct
category limit. If a shipment from the People's Republic of China has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United
States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall
charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered
by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked
commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The visa stamp remains unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions taken concerning the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to imports of textiles
and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of
Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the
Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs
exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of improved solar water
heating technologies for use in buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of wide commercialization of solar water heating systems.
Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual
national energy consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE Funding for the Grant is estimated at $212,000 and the anticipated
period of performance is twelve (12) months.

The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of improved solar heating
technologies for use in buildings. Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of wide commercialization
of solar water heating systems. Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S.,
accounts for about 40% of annual national energy consumption.

projects and other invited papers. Pre-congress courses will be taught by experts in the field on subjects such as:
Drafting a Geothermal Project for Financing by International Organizations, Injections, Drilling Technology
and Regulation, Software for Geothermal Applications, Geothermal Heat Pumps, Small Power Plants, Direct Uses and
Environmental Aspects of Geothermal Development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the IGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff of the International Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to provide this service. The IGA
is an international association for the geothermal industry. Its membership includes 1,971 organizations and individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IGA's base of operations is an office in Berkeley, California, and is fully capable of meeting their needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

adverse effect on continuity and completion of the activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``*&blank;*&blank;* providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology *&blank;*&blank;* necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy

(2) Geothermal EPACT/Climate-Change Action Group_This group will be comprised of representatives of the geothermal
industry, the utility industry, utility regulators and environmental- and energy-advocacy groups. The purpose
of the group will be to devise initiatives that the geothermal industry and DOE could undertake through cost-sharing
arrangements and that address accelerated use of geothermal resources in the United States, thereby helping to reduce
greenhouse gases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Utility Outreach Program_The NGA will provide the data and documentation that utilities and utility commissioners
need in order to understand geothermal power generation better and incorporate it into their portfolios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Develop information on Exporting Goods and Services_Information will be developed that will aid the U.S. geothermal
industry in exporting its goods and services.

 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, and replace with approximately 6.5 miles of 20-inch diameter pipe and 0.1 mile
of 16-inch diameter pipe as an auxiliary crossover pipeline on five segments of Line 1740. Columbia does not request

equivalent design delivery capacity and the facilities proposed for abandonment are obsolete due to class location
changes or are physically deteriorated to the extent that replacement is deemed advisable. The proposed construction
would cost approximately $6,624,000 and the estimated net debit to retirement associated with the abandonment is
$331,000.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Section 205.282(b) of the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy, 10 C.F.R. &sect;205.282(b),
notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set forth below. The Proposed Decision relates
to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc., Gray Trucking Company and William
Valentine &amp; Sons, Inc., which settled alleged violations of the DOE price regulations involving these firms'
sales of crude oil during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures and standards that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
funds remitted by these firms and being held in escrow. The DOE has proposed to distribute the funds in accordance with
the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986)
(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and
injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each
state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would
be based on the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate
injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to submit two copies of their comments. Comments should be submitted within 30 days of publication of
this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in these proceedings
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1:00 to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence

In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the
Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed three Petitions for the Implementation of Special Refund
Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on July 17, 1992, December 7, 1993 and April 13, 1994, respectively.
The Petitions request that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant
to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc. (Western), Gray Trucking Company
(Gray) and William Valentine &amp; Sons, Inc. (Valentine).

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period of Federal petroleum price controls, Western was engaged in crude oil refining and reselling.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The firm was therefore subject to regulations governing the pricing of crude oil set forth at 10 C.F.R. Parts 205, 210,
211, and 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations. As a result of an ERA audit of its operations,
a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) was issued to Western on April 4, 1984 pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart O (ERA
Docket No. 940X00182). The PRO alleged violations of the pricing and certification rules that applied to crude oil
resellers. Essentially, the firm was charged with selling price-controlled crude oil as uncontrolled stripper
well crude oil at unlawfully high prices in violation of the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L and 10 C.F.R.
&sect;212.131. In another enforcement proceeding, on May 7, 1981, a Notice of Probable Violation was issued to Western
which alleged that the firm unlawfully received Small Refiner Bias Entitlements (ERA Docket No. N00S90197) in April
and May 1977. These alleged violations of DOE crude oil regulations by Western were settled by a Consent Order between
the firm and DOE on May 30, 1984. The PRO was therefore withdrawn and the NOPV was rescinded. Western agreed to remit
$300,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Western has complied with
this obligation, remitting a total of $390,059.12 to the DOE. In return, the DOE has released Western from any liability
regarding its failure to comply with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period August
19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, with the sole exception of any potential violations of the Entitlements Program
after September 30, 1980.

Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., and Gibson Oil and Refining Company, were all controlled
by Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels during the price controls period. Textual references to ``Western'' in this Decision
include all parties to the consent order.

Gray was also a crude oil reseller during the period of price controls. On March 29, 1982, Gray and the DOE entered into
a Consent Order whereby Gray would remit $31,500, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow
account. The DOE agreed not to pursue its claim that, during the period March 1977 through January 1980, Gray overcharged
its customers by charging unlawfully high prices for crude oil in violation of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L.
Despite its agreement with the terms of the Consent Order, Gray failed to comply fully with its financial obligations
to the DOE, and remitted only $4,738.86 to the DOE. On October 15, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Texas, Amarillo Division, granted the DOE an Amended Judgment against Gray for an additional $34,625. However,
the Amended Judgment has not resulted in any additional payments to DOE by Gray. ERA has petitioned that the $4,738.86,
plus accrued interest, obtained from Gray be distributed by OHA in accordance with the Subpart V regulations.

Valentine was engaged in crude oil reclamation during the period May 1979 through December 1980.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Through an unincorporated subsidiary, Big Muddy Oil Processors Inc. (Big Muddy), Valentine obtained waste crude
oil from oil spills, pipeline ruptures, waste oil pits and oil tank bottoms. After numerous separation and filtering
processes, the waste oil was mixed with various blending agents (naphthas, natural gasoline, natural gas by-products,
etc.) and the resulting product was sold as pipeline-quality crude oil. Big Muddy, and by extension Valentine, was
therefore a reseller of crude oil, subject to the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L, which governed the resales
of crude oil.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ERA audit uncovered evidence that Valentine sold crude oil at unlawfully high prices during the period May 1979
through December 1980. On December 2, 1987, OHA issued a Remedial Order to Valentine directing the firm to refund $1,454,876
in overcharges, plus interest.

16 DOE &para;83,025 (1987). Valentine appealed OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). On March 23, 1989, FERC rejected Valentine's Appeal of the Remedial Order and upheld OHA's findings.

46 FERC &para;61,252 (1989). Valentine appealed that decision and, on January 24, 1990, the U.S. District Court for
the District of Wyoming ruled that Valentine's challenge to DOE's Remedial Order and to FERC's ruling was without
merit. At the same time, the Court also approved a Settlement Agreement in which Valentine agreed to remit to DOE no
less than $108,739 plus interest. In return, DOE agreed to deem Valentine in full compliance with the price control
program and to release all administrative and civil claims against the firm. Valentine has paid $126,402.66 into
an interest-bearing DOE escrow account in compliance with the Settlement Agreement.

II. Jurisdiction and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges,
51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986) (The MSRP). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement
(the Stripper Well Agreement) in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
M.D.L. No. 378 (D.Kan. 1986), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will be divided among the states, the federal
government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to twenty percent of these crude
oil overcharge funds will be reserved to satisfy valid claims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty
percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states
and federal government for indirect restitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly after the issuance of the MSRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the MSRP in all
Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August
20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing
refund applications in crude oil refund proceedings. On April 6, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous
comments and setting forth generalized procedures to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil
monies under the Subpart V regulations. 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April Notice).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April Notice, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., New York Petroleum, Inc.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various states filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that
the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly
calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Frank G. Theis issued an Opinion
and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). Judge Theis concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the]
OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling
them to a refund.''

M.D.L. 378 overcharges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in
10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify
the persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the
amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the
OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see

Office of Enforcement,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981). After reviewing the records submitted in support of the three Petitions, we have concluded
that a Subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the $521,200.64 in funds obtained from Western,
Gray and Valentine. We therefore propose to grant the ERA's Petitions and assume jurisdiction over distribution
of the funds.

A. Refund Claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April Notice to the crude oil Subpart V proceedings that are the
subject of the present determination. As noted above, the monies deposited with the DOE in settlement of the alleged
crude oil violations totalling $521,200.64, plus accrued interest, are covered by this Proposed Decision. We have
decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $104,240.13 plus interest,
for direct refunds to claimants, in order to insure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the
process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined
products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 14 DOE &para;85,475 (1986). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes
of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, we will presume
that an applicant incurred a crude oil overcharge in the purchase of a product if the product was either identified
as a covered product in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760, or if
the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller.

Great Lakes Carbon Corp.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 22 DOE &para;85,248, at 88,662 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products,
whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are
presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not
submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price
controls. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15 DOE &para;85,495 at 88,893&hyph;96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence
which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., Berry Holding Co., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16 DOE &para;85,405 at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt
on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.

need not file another Application. That previously filed Application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund
proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing
an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.

filed before June 30, 1994, at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants who filed
their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide
in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.

Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this
Proposed Decision, or $416,960.51, plus interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government,
for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in
each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained
in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and
reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

by Gray Trucking Company pursuant to the Consent Order signed on March 29, 1982; and by William Valentine and Sons,
Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L. Marchant, pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement signed on January 24, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

 of September 8, 1993, 58 FR 47273, and in accordance with Procedure for Public Participation in the Formulation of
Marketing Policy published July 6, 1978, 43 FR 29186. In the Notice, Southeastern proposed a System Policy which would
deal with the complete Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects including systems both east and west of
the Savannah River. Based on analysis of proposals and recommendations received, consultations with interested
parties and further studies and considerations, Southeastern decided to develop a policy applying to the system
effective with the expiration of existing contracts, or as soon thereafter as is practical. The policy, when finalized,
will constitute written guidelines for future disposition of power from the system. The policy is developed under
authority of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s, and Section 302(a) of the Department of Energy
Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7152. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments directly to Southeastern
and/or present written or oral views, or data at the public comment forums on the proposed policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Southeastern received only one response to its September 8, 1993, solicitation for proposed and recommendations
contained in its Notice of Intent to Formulate Power Marketing Policy. This response was carefully considered as
were facts gathered from those who consulted with Southeastern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Major issues raised by the proposed policy are determination of marketing area, allocation of power among area customers,
handling of energy at pump-storage installations, utilization of area utility systems for power integration, firming,
wheeling, exchange and other essential relationships, wholesale rates, handling of resale relationships, and
conservation measures. An Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact have been prepared indicating
that the proposed power marketing policy will not have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment.
A copy may be obtained by contacting the Administrator at the address or telephone number listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment forums will not be adjudicative in nature. The Administrator shall act as or appoint a forum chairman.
At the start of the forums the chairman shall briefly explain procedures and rules. Customers and the public shall
be allowed to make oral statements and comments, introduce relevant documents, and ask questions regarding the proposed
power marketing policy of Southeastern representatives at the forum. Persons requesting to speak shall notify Southeastern
at which forum or forums they desire to speak at least 3 days before the particular forum is scheduled so that a list of
forum participants can be prepared. If necessary, the chairman may establish time limitations for oral presentations
by these participants to assure that all who register to speak shall have an opportunity to do so. Others will be permitted
to speak if time allows. Those unable to speak because of time limitations and others who so desire may submit written
comments. The chairman and Southeastern representatives may question forum participants and, the chairman, at
his discretion, may permit other participants a like privilege. Questions not answered by Southeastern representatives
during a forum shall be specifically identified by the chairman in the transcript and shall be subsequently responded
to by Southeastern in writing. All documents introduced and written answers to questions shall be available for inspection
and copying at Southeastern headquarters in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Forum proceedings shall
be transcribed. Copies of the transcript may be purchased from the reporter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customers and the public may consult or file written comments and questions with Southeastern regarding the proposed
marketing policy on or before September 16, 1994. All such questions shall receive expeditious response, September
16, 1994. All such questions shall receive expeditious response, and all such comments, questions and answers shall
be available at Southeastern headquarters for inspection or copying in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act. The forum transcripts will likewise be available for inspection at Southeastern headquarters in Elberton,
Georgia.

It will become effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will be applicable to the sale of system power in respective utility areas as then existing contracts, or necessary
extensions, expire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy will be implemented through negotiated contracts for terms not to exceed 10 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transmission facilities owned by utilities within the marketing area will be used for all necessary purposes including
transmitting power to load centers. Deliveries may be made at the projects, at utilities' interconnections or at
customer substations, as determined by Southeastern. The projects will be hydraulically, electrically, and financially
integrated, and will be operated to make maximum contribution to the power supply of the selected utility areas. Preference
in the sale of the power shall be given to public bodies and cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing Area. The marketing area shall consist of the approximate 112,000 square mile area generally known as The
Southern Company service area, and the approximate 40,000 square mile area generally known as the service areas of
the South Carolina Public Service Authority and the South Carolina Electric and Gas Company plus that portion of the
Duke Power Company's service area within a radius of 150 miles of the Hartwell, Russell or Thurmond projects. Eligible
public bodies and cooperatives in this marketing area are listed in Appendix A attached hereto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocations of Existing Power. Existing power available under this policy for allocation from the Georgia-Alabama-South

Except where duplication of allocation would result, each public body and cooperative within the marketing areas
as shown in Appendix A will be eligible for an allocation of existing power, except for the City of Oxford, Georgia.
No reallocation of existing power for the benefit of Oxford is proposed at this time. Existing preference customers
within the marketing area will retain their present allocations of capacity and essentially the same energy accompaniment.
It is Southeastern's goal to allocate all available and useful system power (that power remaining after provision
for an appropriate capacity margin and losses) to preference customers, except power that may be used for pumping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocation of Power From Russell Pumped Storage Units. Currently, the pump generator units at the Richard B. Russell
Project are undergoing a series of environmental tests to meet the requirements of an injunction imposed by the U.S.
District Court in the case of

Marsh et al, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
866 F.2d 97 (4th Cir 1989). The first opportunity for commercial operation of the pumping units is after the completion
of these tests. The environmental tests and schedules were agreed upon by the Corps of Engineers and the party litigants,
and the results of the tests must be approved by the district court before the units become commercially available.
Should pumped storage units at the Russell project become commercially available during the tenure of contracts
implementing this policy, after the approval of the district court, after further mitigating modifications required
by environmental concerns, or by any other means, Southeastern will allocate this additional power as detailed in
the Power Marketing Policy for the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects promulgated on October 1,
1980 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The capacity relative to the Russell pumped storage units will be allocated to the City of Oxford, Georgia, and to
the existing customers in The Southern Company service area including Alabama Electric Cooperative and South Mississippi
Electric Power Association (130 MW), the Duke Power Company service area (65 MW), the South Carolina Electric and
Gas service area (5 MW) and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (60 MW). Adequate capacity has been retained
to provide an appropriate capacity margin. Russell pumped storage capacity is predicted a this time on testing accomplished
to date and reflects the best estimate at this time. Energy accompaniment to the pumped storage capacity will be sufficient
to provide viable peaking capacity. The Russell pumped storage power will be allocated as follows:

Power From Pumped Water. Southeastern will utilize its combination pumped storage and generation resources to produce
high-value on-peak power. Pumping power, whether generated within the system of projects or obtained by purchasing
or exchange agreement, will be used in pumped storage operations, at Southeastern's discretion. Should the purchase
alternative be selected, Southeastern will obtain pumping energy from utilities offering the best terms, and/or
resulting in the most benefits to the system. Should the exchange alternative be selected, pumped storage operations
will be handled with public bodies, cooperatives and the utilities in a manner not involving the direct purchase and
sales approach, with preference given to public bodies and cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Utilization Of Utility Systems. In the absence of transmission facilities of its own, Southeastern will use area
generation and transmission systems to integrate the Government's projects, provide firming, wheeling, exchange
and backup services and such other functions as may be necessary to dispose of system power under reasonable and acceptable
marketing arrangements. Utility systems providing such services shall be entitled to adequate compensation. Specific
terms and conditions of all such arrangements shall be the subject of negotiations between Southeastern and the generation
and transmission utilities providing the services. Individual preferred agencies directly affected by the negotiations
shall, through representatives selected at the outset of negotiations, be kept currently advised on the status and
progress of negotiations. Southeastern also will consult with and seek advice from these affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Wholesale Rates. Rate schedules shall be drawn to recover all costs associated with producing and transmitting the
power in accordance with then current repayment criteria. Production costs will be determined on a system basis and
rate schedules will relate to the integrated output of the projects. Rate schedules may be revised periodically.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Resale Rates. Resale rate provisions requiring the benefits of Southeastern power to be passed on to the ultimate
consumer will be included in each Southeastern customer contract that provides for Southeastern to supply more than
25 percent of the customers' total power requirements during the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Energy and Economic Efficiency Measures. Each customer who purchases Southeastern's power is encouraged to participate
in an integrated resource plan that considers both supply and demand side alternatives. It is recognized that some
Southeastern customers are members of a power supply organization that does resource planning for its customers
(i.e., power supply cooperatives and joint action agencies). Where a customer, or a power supply organization that
does resource planning for a Southeastern customer, is responsible to a regulatory body or another Government agency
for an integrated resource plan, the customer will make a copy of such integrated resource plan available to Southeastern.
All Southeastern customers shall agree to encourage the efficient use of energy by ultimate customers.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In December 1993, Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposed to change the way it markets power and energy
produced by the Provo River Project (PRP) and to include it as one of the Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated
Projects). During the comment period on the proposal, comments were received which indicated that customers of Western's
Integrated Projects would not support inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. Western has decided to modify
its original proposal to market this power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Capacity and energy
produced by the PRP will be allocated to those members of Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah
Municipal Power Agency (UMPA) located in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. ICPA and UMPA are hereafter referred to
as potential contractors. Power would be allocated to these potential contractors proportional to their load. Separate
power sales contracts would be offered to the potential contractors. Potential contractors would pay all of the annual
powerplant expenses of the PRP including an amount to assist the Provo River Water Users Association (Water Users)
repayment of the United States original investment in the PRP. In return, potential contractors would receive all
of the marketable output of the PRP.

 notice dated December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65180&hyph;65181), Western proposed to include the PRP with the Integrated
Projects and to market the power and energy produced by the PRP to members of ICPA and UMPA within a marketing area comprised
of Utah and Wasatch Counties, Utah. Western accepted comments on its proposal until January 12, 1994. A public information/comment/scoping
meeting was held in Spanish Fork, Utah, on January 4, 1994. As a result of comments received, at both the meeting and
in writing, Western is revising its proposed marketing plan for the PRP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the commentors, the Colorado River Energy Distributor's Association (CREDA), an organization of many Integrated
Projects customers, commented that CREDA believes ``the same principles commonly used in other Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) water projects having power generation features should be applied to the extent lawful in the instance
of PRP.'' Western's review of the appropriate laws shows that construction of the PRP and the methods of repaying the
United States for its investment in the project were first established in 1936, under Contract No. Ilr-874 dated June
27, 1936 (1936 Contract). The 1936 Contract states that surplus revenue from the sale of surplus water and power shall
be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water Users. No distinction was made in the contract that this payment
was to be for irrigation investment or for investment beyond the irrigators' ability to pay as is common in other Reclamation
projects. In fact, from the beginning, almost three-fourths of the water developed by the project was for municipal
and industrial use. Western has agreed to pay from power revenues $1.623 million toward the Water Users' obligation
by 2008. Of this amount, $191,587 has been paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CREDA also stated that it did not believe Western had adequately supported the need to integrate the projects. When
Western established the Integrated Projects in 1986, it intended to include the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP),
the Collbran Project, the Rio Grande Project, and the PRP. The PRP was not included because of uncertainty associated
with commitments to the Water Users. Western's intent was to bring PRP into the Integrated Projects on an equal basis
with the rest of the projects. Western has agreed that it is not necessary to include the PRP in the Integrated Projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a further comment, CREDA objected to all Integrated Projects customers paying costs of the Water Users since these
constitute repayment of municipal and industrial water development costs. CREDA had no objection to marketing the
PRP resource to ICPA and UMPA under separate contracts from the Integrated Projects. In fact, ICPA and UMPA are both
members of CREDA. Western has determined that it can still meet its objectives of beneficially marketing the PRP through
separate contractual arrangements and has revised its proposal to do so. This will require development of power sales
contracts with potential contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the PRP has only been sold to Western's CRSP, a rate for the capacity and energy produced has never been developed.
A power repayment study (PRS) has been prepared each year to determine the revenues needed to meet project repayment,
including operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses. The CRSP purchased the energy produced by the PRP for
this amount. Western now proposes that the PRS still be used to identify the annual revenue requirements of the PRP.
Potential contractors would pay their proportional share of one-twelfth of the annual amount each month to Western.
In addition, the potential contractors would pay a total of $102,243.80 each year to Reclamation to be applied toward
the Water Users' payment obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other Integrated Projects customers in Utah, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (Weber Basin) and Bountiful
City Light and Power (Bountiful), operate generating plants on the Weber River. Both claimed when water is diverted
from the Weber River into the Provo River under existing agreements, they incur losses in generation and asked to be
compensated for these losses. Western has determined that the water diversions from the Weber River into the Provo
River were established before Weber Basin or Bountiful constructed generation on the Weber River. Neither entity
had a power right to the waters of the Weber River. PacifiCorp, which is compensated for generating losses, owned an
operating generating plant on the Weber River and held power rights to the flows of the river prior to the Provo River
diversion. Discussions with Reclamation and examination of Weber Basin and Bountiful contracts have confirmed
this position. Weber Basin and Bountiful are not entitled to an allocation of PRP power to compensate them for harm
caused by reduced flows in the Weber River because their plants have never been entitled to, or used, the diverted water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentor, Reclamation, stated that the marketing criteria should consider arrangements for providing
assistance to the Water Users. Also, the amount of assistance should be included in the PRP power marketing contracts,
and arrangements made so that payment could be made directly to Reclamation on behalf of the Water Users during the
contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These issues are still subject to further discussions with the Water Users and Reclamation. However, Western has
committed to provide a means for annual payment to be made toward project repayment on behalf of the Water Users by the
power purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reclamation also noted that the amount of winter season surplus energy is affected by several factors, including
the agreement dated May 16, 1986, known as the Interim Operating Agreement of Deer Creek and Strawberry Exchange of
Bonneville Unit Water (Interim Operating Agreement), and future agreements on the operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle
Reservoirs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reclamation has made it clear that the Interim Operating Agreement and future agreements may severely impact the
amount of generation available from the PRP during the winter season. The Interim Operating Agreement anticipated
that compensation to PacifiCorp, for energy lost when water is diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River,
would be affected and it provided a remedy. However, the Interim Operating Agreement does not address compensation
to the Water Users by Central Utah Water Conservancy District (Central Utah) for other winter season generation which
would be lost. Draft language on an agreement for joint operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle Reservoirs provides
a means for Central Utah to compensate the Water Users for this reduction. Drafts of this agreement stipulate that
a separate agreement among Central Utah, the Water Users, Western, PacifiCorp, and Reclamation will be developed
to provide for this compensation. It is anticipated that this agreement will be completed prior to initial service
under Western's proposed marketing plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Water Users commented that Western's criteria for marketing the surplus power and energy of the Deer Creek Powerplant
must fairly compensate the Water Users for the value of the surplus electric power and energy in the form of assistance
on its repayment obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western's criteria specify that the annual revenue requirements, including Western's commitment to the Water Users,
will be recovered from the potential contractors in return for all of the marketable power and energy produced by the
PRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Water Users further commented that the rate for nonfirm energy should be the same as the blended rate of firm energy.
Western's revised proposal would eliminate any distinction between firm and nonfirm energy. All energy produced
by the PRP would be delivered in return for the potential contractors paying all of the PRP's annual powerplant expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the Water Users' comments are concerned with their claim to a contractual obligation that surplus revenue from
the sale of power be applied toward the repayment obligation of the Water Users for the PRP. Western has stated that
it will consider $1.623 million by 2008 as a repayment assistance to the PRP. The Water Users assert that there is an
obligation to develop surplus revenue from power sales that can be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water
Users beyond 2008 until all repayment obligations have been met. Western knows of no legal basis for the Water Users'
position. Resolution of these issues are outside the scope of this proposed action. These issues have been the focus
of several meetings between the Water Users, Western, and Reclamation. Western's proposal would provide a means
to ensure that the balance of the $1.623 million commitment is paid in annual increments by 2008.

Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UMPA states that use of PRP energy in Utah County, Utah, will result in reduced reliance on fossil fuels and will enhance
the environment, especially air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue will be addressed in the environmental assessment which will be done on the proposed action. However, because
of the quantities of energy involved in the proposal, it is unlikely that the action will have a significant impact
on air quality in Utah County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Stonefly Society (Society), a local environmental organization, commented that operation of the PRP on the Provo,
Duchesne, and Weber Rivers has produced devastating impacts on these river systems. Among these are: (1) Destruction
of the Provo's natural channel and riparian areas, (2) anoxic water discharge from Deer Creek Reservoir, (3) dewatering
of the Weber River, and (4) dewatering of the Duchesne River. They state that three actions should be taken: (1) studies
of the environmental impacts of the PRP should be conducted immediately; (2) funds should be allocated from Deer Creek
Power revenues to correct these serious problems; and (3) no funds should be allocated to the PRP until these environmental
impacts have been both assessed and corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western's proposal is to only change the way power from the PRP is marketed. It will have no effect on how the PRP is operated.
The Society's issues are concerned with the way the project is operated and not on how power is marketed. Therefore,
their comments are outside the scope of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Society asked ``if the PRP were included in the Integrated Projects, will the powerplant at Deer Creek Reservoir
be operated independently or will the operation be integrated with other Western generating facilities? If its operation
is integrated, will there be environmental impacts at these other facilities?'' Western's proposal is to market
the PRP independently of the Integrated Projects. There would be no operation connection between the projects. Furthermore,
since Deer Creek Powerplant is not controlled by Western, delivery of power and energy to the customer would be, as
always, on a run-of-the-river basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress granted to the Secretary of Energy acting by and through Western's Administrator the authority to market
Federal power. In response to requests from UMPA and ICPA to receive power produced by the PRP, Western has examined
the merits of reorganizing the marketing of the PRP resource. Western believes these proposed marketing changes
will benefit both the potential contractors and the Water Users.

b. Marketable Resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A contract among Reclamation, the Water Users, the Weber River Water Users Association, and PacifiCorp dated December
20, 1938 (1938 Contract), provides for diversion of water from the Weber River into the Provo River for storage in Deer
Creek Reservoir and for use by the Water Users. Because PacifiCorp operated generating units on the Weber River below
the point of diversion to the Provo River, PacifiCorp's ability to generate was reduced when water was diverted. The
1938 Contract provides that PacifiCorp is to receive all of the electrical generation of the PRP during the period
of time that water is diverted. This means that for up to 6 months, from October 15 to April 15 of each year, there may be
no marketable energy generated by the PRP. Historically however, marketable energy has averaged 23,000,000 kilowatthours
(kWh), with 15,000,000 kWh generated during summer months, and the remaining 8,000,000 kWh from winter surplus energy.
Typically, about 3,000,000 kWh are available in each of the 3 peak summer months of June, July, and August; approximately
1,000,000 kWh are available in April; 2,500,000 kWh in May; and another 2,500,000 kWh in September. ICPA and UMPA would
receive all of the marketable energy generated by the PRP each year in return for paying all of the PRP powerplant expenses.

c. Marketing Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the size of the resource, Western proposes to limit the marketing of this resource to preference entities
within the drainage area of the Provo River. All eligible utilities are members of ICPA and UMPA, and are located in
Utah and Wasatch Counties. Members of ICPA are the cities of Heber City, Lehi, Payson, Springville, and the Strawberry
Electric Service District (Strawberry). Affected members of UMPA are the cities of Provo, Salem, and Spanish Fork.
It is anticipated that marketing of the PRP resource to these potential contractors would assure that each would receive
a beneficial amount of power.

d. Class of Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PRP generation is dependent upon water releases that are dictated by minimum stream flow requirements and the Water
Users' needs. No load following ability exists. Since April 1, 1994, the PRP has been included in Western's Upper Colorado
Missouri Basin control area. With the PRP in Western's control area, Western is able to enhance the usability of the
product and to allow it to be scheduled, even though it has no control over PRP generation. Western provides control
area and regulating services for several other customers and has a developed methodology to share the expenses of
operating a control area and providing for regulating capacity. Under the revised proposal, the PRP would be required
to pay for its share of these services. These costs will be included in the PRS as an operating expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy will be scheduled to the potential contractors in megawatts in accordance with anticipated generation levels
from the PRP. When variations occur, the hourly schedules will be adjusted to reflect actual operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western will maintain an energy deviation account between the PRP and the Integrated Projects. At the end of each year,
an accounting of scheduled and generated energy will be made. Differences between the two projects will be made up
by adding to or subtracting from the following year's schedules to the potential contractors. The potential contractors
will be responsible for reserves in accordance with Inland Power Pool requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
e. Resource Allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western proposes to allocate PRP resources in proportion to the historical sales of each of the ICPA and UMPA members.
UMPA members serve approximately 70 percent of the load in the marketing area, and the city of Provo is by far the largest
member. ICPA members serve approximately 30 percent of the marketing area load. Proportional allocation of the PRP's
average annual output of 23,000,000 kWh would mean UMPA members could expect an average of 16,100,000 kWh and 3,500
kilowatts (kW) of contingent capacity, and ICPA members could expect an average of 6,900,000 kWh and 1,500 kW of contingent
capacity. Of ICPA members' 30 percent, Heber City would receive 6 percent, Lehi 2.7 percent, Springville 12.9 percent,
Payson 4.8 percent, and Strawberry 3.6 percent. Of UMPA members' 70 percent, Provo would receive 60.9 percent, Salem
1.4 percent, and Spanish Fork 7.7 percent. Western would develop firm power sales contracts with ICPA and UMPA on behalf
of their members which would specify the terms and conditions of receiving PRP power. The power sales contracts would
be structured such that if a member withdraws from either ICPA or UMPA, it would be able to retain its entitlement of
PRP power.

ICPA and UMPA would pay the PRP's total annual powerplant expenses in return for the total marketable PRP production.
Each would pay its proportional share of the operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses identified in the
PRS in 12 monthly installments. In addition, before January 1 of each year, ICPA would pay $30,685.71 and UMPA $71,600.00

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Western will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 through preparation of an environmental assessment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western has no operational control over the PRP. Deer Creek Dam is operated primarily for the benefit of water storage
and delivery. Power production is a secondary benefit and does not influence dam operations in any manner. Therefore,
the proposed PRP marketing changes will have no effect on dam operations.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), each agency, when publishing a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment
an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined
that: (1) This rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of
the Act, and (2) the impacts of an allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities.

needs. A 5-place analytical balance is required for weighing filters before and after sampling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test samplers representative of this method have been tested by the applicant, in accordance with the test procedures
specified in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submitted by the applicant,
EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this method should be designated as a reference method. The information
submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with
40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a designated reference method, this method is acceptable for use by States and other air monitoring agencies under
requirements of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes, the method must be used in accordance
with the guidance in appendix J to 40 CFR part 50 and the specific procedures contained in the operation or instruction
manual associated with the method. Use of the method is also subject to any limitations specified in the applicable
designation (see description of the method above). Vendor modifications of a designated method used for purposes
of part 58 are permitted only with prior approval of EPA, as provided in part 53. Provisions concerning modification
of such methods by users are specified under section 2.8 of appendix C to 40 CFR part 58 (Modifications of Methods by
Users).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, this designation applies to any sampler which is identical to the sampler described in the designation.
Similar samplers manufactured and sold prior to the designation may be upgraded (e.g., by minor modification or by
substitution of a new operation or instruction manual) so as to be identical to the designated method and thus achieve
designation status at a modest cost. The manufacturer should be consulted to determine the feasibility of such upgrading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 53 requires that sellers of designated methods comply with certain conditions. These conditions are given in
40 CFR 53.9 and are summarized below for PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that the State of South Carolina is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision
Primacy Program. South Carolina has adopted drinking water regulations for Volatile Organic Chemicals, Synthetic
Organic Chemicals and Inorganic Chemicals (known as Phase II and Phase IIB of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Regulation)
and for Lead and Copper. EPA has determined that these State program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding
federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve the State program revisions.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(r)(10) of the Clean Air Act directs the President to conduct a review of release prevention, mitigation,
and response authorities across the Federal government. The Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with
the other member agencies of the Federal National Response Team (NRT), conducted the review and submitted its report
to the Congress in February 1994. The report concludes that while the current hazardous materials safety system achieves
its statutory goals to protect public health and safety and the environment, it is overly complex and confusing and,
as a result, imposes unnecessary costs on government, industry, and the public. To address these issues and to consider
appropriate remedies, the report proposes a second phase involving stakeholder participation that will focus on:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Streamlining the multiple and overlapping statutory terms for regulated substances and reportable events,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Harmonizing multiple and/or redundant hazard classification systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Analyzing the efficacy of multiple requirements for facility contingency plans and the desirability of a
Federal baseline standard with added components for special concerns, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Streamlining accident data collection and management systems to improve efficiency, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Improving Federal/state/local coordination of emergency planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of the second phase of the project is to identify specific administrative and statutory changes that will
yield a more coordinated, rational, and efficient approach to hazardous materials safety. The period provided under
this notice for statements is designed to provide an opportunity for interested parties to have input into this process
and help shape any potential recommendations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised federal MSWLF criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Florida applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Florida's application and
proposed a determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF
criteria. After consideration of all comments received, EPA is today issuing a final determination that the State's
program is adequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the federal criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised federal criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.

B. State of Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 20, 1993, Florida submitted an application for adequacy determination for their municipal solid waste landfill
permit program. On March 2, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Florida's
program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 9980&hyph;9983 (March 2,
1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and
a public hearing which was held by EPA_Region IV on April 25, 1994, in Tallahassee, Florida. The public comment period,
which originally ended on April 25, 1994, was extended an additional seven (7) days because of public interest. Comments
were accepted on the tentative determination through close of business on May 2, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Region IV received written and oral comments during the public comment period and public hearing on the tentative
determination of adequacy for Florida. In addition to comments supporting EPA's determination, several issues
and concerns were raised, which are outlined and responded to below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Liner design_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following issues regarding Florida's
liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills: (1) Florida fails to require adequate liner design criteria which
complies with minimum federal requirements and that would reduce leaks and improve leak detection capabilities,
(2) Florida's liner designs contemplate the allowance of a double geomembrane liner without a low permeable clay
component, (3) many of the assumptions that Florida made in their required MuitiMed modelling efforts were not actually
indicative of conditions in Florida or did not present actual ``worst-case'' conditions, as is required when states
submit alternative liner designs for EPA review, and (4) Florida's liner design demonstration was based on a point
of compliance nearly 500 feet from the landfill boundary (almost five (5) times the distance allowed by state law).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA was charged with reviewing state municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs to determine if they meet
the standards presently set forth in the federal criteria for municipal solid waste landfills, which are found at
parts 257 and 258 of Chapter 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 257 and 258). Florida's regulations incorporate
ten (10) liner designs to be used in landfills in the state. Nine (9) of the liner designs are single composite systems
which incorporate_from top to bottom_a leachate collection system, a flexible synthetic membrane and a layer of
compacted soil (the federal standard liner system is also a composite requiring the same components, in the same order).
The tenth of Florida's designs is a double liner system, which incorporates_from top to bottom_a leachate collection
system, a flexible synthetic membrane, a second leachate collection/detection system, a second flexible synthetic
membrane and a layer of compacted soil. The state of Florida has presented information to satisfactorily demonstrate
that each of the liner systems prescribed in their regulations will meet the federal performance standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA performed an extensive review of Florida's liner requirements and found them to be comparable to the federal criteria
at 40 CFR part 258. In addition, EPA Region IV retained an independent contractor to evaluate Florida's liner systems
and conferred with an EPA landfill liner expert. After thorough review of all submitted information, the contractor
also found Florida's liner systems to be comparable to the federal criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's expert was called upon in the matter of Florida's assumption of 1 cm2/acre defect density in the flexible membrane
portion(s) of their liner system. According to the EPA expert, with appropriate quality assurance/quality control
(QA/QC) during installation of the flexible membranes, the referenced defect density is achievable and has been
extensively documented. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 contain no specific QA/QC provisions. It is assumed
that QA/QC will be ensured prior to disposal of wastes in landfill units. As Florida's QA/QC requirements are quite
extensive and as it is the state alternative liner designs and not QA/QC that is being evaluated for comparability,
it is appropriate to assume that Florida will ensure that QA/QC requirements are met during installation of municipal
solid waste landfill liner systems in their state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the distance that Florida used for the point of compliance in their modelling, states must demonstrate
to EPA that proposed alternatives meet federal performance standards. The federal performance standard for liner
designs is that maximum concentration limits (MCLs) for listed constituents not be exceeded in the uppermost aquifer
at the point of compliance, which must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately
500 feet of the landfill unit boundary). Although Florida requires that MCLs not be exceeded at a maximum distance
of 100 feet (which is more restrictive than the federal criteria), utilization of the 500 foot distance is appropriate
for Florida's demonstration that their requirements meet the federal performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Authority for and implications of approving alternative liner designs in Florida_Comments were received during
the public comment period questioning whether EPA is authorized to allow statewide alternative liner designs and
stating that Region IV's decision on Florida's liner designs will have national implications based on the presumption
that any alternative liner design that EPA approves for Florida must likewise be approved in other states, ``given
Florida's extreme vulnerability to groundwater pollution.'' EPA Headquarters has addressed the issue of EPA's
authority to approve statewide alternative liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills. After review of 40
CFR part 258, the preamble to part 258 and EPA Headquarters training materials on the implementation of part 258, EPA
Headquarters prepared a memorandum which concluded that the flexibility afforded to an approved State/Tribe allows
the application of an alternative liner design on a State/Tribal-wide basis so long as that design meets the performance
standard in all locations throughout the State/Tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the presumption that alternatives approved for Florida will have to be approved for other states, the State/Tribal
adequacy review process requires EPA to evaluate each state's municipal solid waste landfill permit program based
on the specifics of individual state requirements. Proposed alternatives to any of the federal standards are only
to be accepted if the state demonstrates that the alternative(s) would meet federal performance standards. States
proposing alternative liner designs are required to present data from analysis via the MultiMed fate and transport
model, which requires information that can only be expressed based on particular state conditions (eg., precipitation,
hydrologic conditions, etc.). EPA's decision to approve or disapprove a state's alternative liner design weighs
heavily on the results of this state-specific modelling. Therefore, approval of an alternative liner design in one
state would not automatically make the same liner approvable in another state.

3. Groundwater/Drinking Water_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following concerns
regarding the effects of municipal solid waste landfills on groundwater and drinking water in the State of Florida:
(1) Florida's present municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately protect high quality groundwater
and the State should prohibit landfills from being located in sensitive areas, such as above underground sources
of drinking water, and (2) there is the possibility of leachate discharges from municipal solid waste landfills contaminating
drinking water wells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The federal criteria require that groundwater be monitored for constituents at a distance no more than 150 meters
(approximately 500 feet) from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property boundary, whichever
is less. The point at which groundwater is monitored is to be chosen considering several factors, one of which is whether
the groundwater is used for drinking water. Florida's program meets these standards. Florida has made revisions
to their requirements to include all of the contaminants for which the federal standards require monitoring. Florida
also requires periodic sampling of leachate generated by the landfill to determine which contaminants would be of
concern in the event of a release to the subsurface. This analysis is not required by the federal criteria. Further,
as previously mentioned, Florida requires monitoring of groundwater and corrective action if groundwater is found
to be contaminated at a distance not to exceed 100 feet from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property
boundary, whichever is less. Again, Florida's 100 foot distance is more stringent than the federal criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding landfills being sited in the vicinity of drinking water intakes, the federal criteria for locating municipal
solid waste landfills are very general and include restrictions (but not necessarily prohibitions) to locating
municipal solid waste landfills in floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas and
areas in close vicinity to airports. The State of Florida's regulations have been deemed adequate in that they meet
the minimum federal requirements. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 do not address drinking water intakes with
respect to locating landfills. Further, EPA cannot 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
require
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Florida to adopt more stringent requirements to receive approval of their program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Health/Risk Assessment_Comments were received during the public comment period presenting the concern that
Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately assess the adverse impact on human health
resulting from exposure to landfill leachate in drinking water. It was suggested that Florida be required to evaluate
human health effects from chronic exposure to contaminants released from municipal solid waste. Addressing this
issue was beyond the scope of EPA's review of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting program. However,
the types of complex health studies that are referenced are generally conducted as research projects by organizations
and health scientists trained in this field. Such work is ongoing in federally-funded laboratories, universities
and other research organizations. On occasion, these studies are conducted in community populations that are known
to have been exposed to environmental contaminants over an extended period of time and that claim to have a high level
of health problems believed to be associated with the contamination. With the multiple stresses and health problems
that typically exist in a community, it is extremely difficult to prove a causal association with a specific environmental
exposure. Such health studies are complex, difficult to interpret and often inconclusive. Therefore, a requirement
for health evaluations are not typically included, per se, in regulatory permit programs but rather these programs
use toxicity and risk assessment information to develop the technical permit requirements that would be health protective.
Florida's municipal solid waste landfill program was developed in a manner which satisfactorily meets the above
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Public Participation_Comments were received during the public comment period petitioning for ``corrective
action to redress inadequate public participation in development of Florida's Solid Waste Management Plan.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under EPA's rules for public participation, a state, in its development of rules for a Subtitle D program, has the option
of following the requirements of the state's administrative procedures act, if one exists. Florida does have an administrative
procedures act and the State complied with its requirements in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, Florida has
complied with EPA's rules for public participation. In addition, EPA has provided public participation opportunities
in its review of whether the Florida program is adequate when compared to the criteria of 40 CFR Part 258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Environmental Justice_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that there should
be an evaluation of the environmental justice implications of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting
rules prior to approval of Florida's program. There is concern that (1) Florida's program was ``developed with grossly
inadequate provisions for participation by persons most threatened by toxic pollution of their water supplies''
and (2) Florida's present program fails to provide equal protection to people obtaining drinking water from private
wells (low-income communities were specifically referenced).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Review of Florida's practices with respect to environmental justice was beyond the scope of this adequacy determination.
In an effort to address questions of environmental justice, EPA_Region IV established the Office of Environmental
Justice in 1993. In March 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive Order that is designed to focus federal attention
on the environmental and human health conditions in minority communities. EPA's primary objectives with respect
to environmental justice are: (a) ensure that all EPA Region IV environmental programs do not adversely impact minority
populations and persons living at or below the poverty level, (b) address complaints from communities regarding
subjection to a disproportionate burden of the pollution generated by industry and municipalities and (c) provide
for outreach programs that will bring minority communities, environmental groups, and government together on relevant
environmental issues. Guidelines for implementing these objectives and the requirements of the Executive Order
within EPA programs are presently being developed at the Regional and Headquarters levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Mandated Recycling_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that Florida be required
to mandate separation of recyclables and toxic contaminants from municipal solid waste prior to disposal in landfills.
The federal operating criteria for municipal solid waste landfills include procedures for excluding the receipt
of regulated hazardous waste, which require implementation of ``a program at the facility for detecting and preventing
the disposal of regulated hazardous wastes and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) wastes''. The state's program must
incorporate, at a minimum: random inspections of incoming loads, records of inspections, training facility personnel
to recognize prohibited wastes and notification of the proper authorities if a regulated hazardous waste or PCB is
discovered at the facility. Florida's program meets the federal requirements for exclusion of regulated hazardous
substances in municipal solid waste landfills. However, there presently are no federal regulations which mandate
recycling. Therefore, requiring separation of recyclables from municipal solid waste streams prior to disposal
is a decision which must be made on the state and/or local level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Florida's rules for municipal solid waste landfills are not enforceable at municipal solid waste landfills
located on Indian Lands in the State of Florida.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the public comments, I conclude that Florida's application for adequacy determination meets all
of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted a determination
of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the federal criteria. See 56

FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's/Tribe's program are already in effect as a matter of State/Tribal
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply.
Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents: State or local governments and businesses or other for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Needs and Uses: Part 69 of the Commission's rules and regulations establishes the rules for access charges for interstate
or foreign access provided by telephone companies on or after January 1, 1984. Part 69 essentially consists of rules
or the procedures for the computation of access charges which are not information collections as defined by 5 CFR 1320.
Any reporting or disclosure requirements occurs in connection with particular tariff filings with the FCC or other
state commissions or with records maintained in accordance to the Uniform Systems of Accounts (USOA). Section 69.3
requires the annual submission of access charge tariffs. Section 69.116(c) and 69.117(c) requires LECs to file information
with NECA semi-annually pertaining to the number of lines in their study areas and interexchange carriers to which
such lines are presubscribed. This information will be used by NECA to assess revenue requirements needed to fund
the Universal Service Fund and Lifeline Assistance Programs. Section 69.104(k)(1) requires that a state or local
telephone company wishing to implement an end user common line reduction or waiver for its subscribers file information
with the FCC demonstrating that its state lifeline assistance plan meets certain criteria. This is a one-time filing
requirement. Section 69.104(l) requires local telephone carriers to calculate for NECA their projected revenue
requirements for the lifeline assistance programs. Section 69.605 requires carriers who are participating in the
pool to report access revenues and cost data so that NECA may compute monthly pool revenues distributions. The information
is used by FCC staff to compute charges in tariffs for access service (or origination and termination) and to compute
revenue pool distributions. Neither process could be implemented without the information.

Part I_General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Program Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Head Start is a national program providing comprehensive developmental services primarily to low-income preschool
children and their families. To help enrolled children achieve their full potential, Head Start programs provide
comprehensive health, nutritional, educational, social, and other services. In addition Head Start programs are
required to provide for the direct participation of the parents of enrolled children in the development, conduct,
and direction of local programs. Head Start currently serves approximately 713,000 children through a network of
approximately 1,395 grantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Head Start is targeted primarily toward children whose families have incomes at or below the poverty line or
who are eligible for public assistance, regulations permit up to 10 percent of the Head Start children in local programs
to be from families which do not meet these low-income criteria. Head Start regulations also require that a minimum
of 10 percent of enrollment opportunities in each program be made available to children with disabilities. Such children
are expected to be enrolled in the full range of Head Start services and activities in a mainstream setting with their
non-disabled peers, and to receive needed special education and related services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background on Demonstration Project ``A Head Start on Science'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The report from the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion emphasizes that quality services to Head
Start families must be given priority attention by all Head Start programs. The report underscored the need for staff
development and training and supports initiatives designed to increase staff understanding of concepts and principles
which will help them become more effective in early childhood settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project is designed to link colleges and universities to Head Start programs for the purpose of teaching science
to Head Start staff. Highly intensive, hands-on instruction will provide teachers, assistants, and home visitors
with exposure to the principles of science and increase their insights and skills regarding how to take their college
campus experience and create classroom environments which invite child exploration and discovery. The staff will
also increase their understanding of the natural learning environment presented by the out-of-doors, and the child's
own home. We expect that ``A Head Start on Science'' model will be developed and documented in suitable printed and
visual materials to be used to transmit the concept and approaches to other institutions of higher learning and Head
Start communities. Project funds may also be used to present and distribute information at appropriate regional
and national Head Start events, and to members of the Head Start training and technical assistance network. Also,
it would be appropriate for the grantee to develop strategies and products which will assist other local Head Start
programs to negotiate with their local college or university for similar staff training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that as a result of participating in ``A Head Start on Science'' demonstration project, Head Start teachers,
teacher assistants, and home visitors will be instrumental in creating a lifelong interest in science both for themselves
and for the children and families with whom they work. We believe that staff will be impacted by the knowledge that science
is found not only in a laboratory under a microscope, but in the everyday world in which they live. As a result of this
experience, teachers, assistants and home visitors' concepts of science and their own scientific abilities will
increase and in turn have a powerful effect on their ability to engage in discovery and establish environments in which
children and families may explore, discover and interpret scientific activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This announcement is soliciting applications from four-year colleges or universities, i.e., institutions of higher
learning that grant degrees. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although projects
periods may be for two years. Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year
budget period but within the two year project period will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive
basis, subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued
funding would be in the best interest of the Government. The Department of Health and Human Services will award one
grant under this announcement. Up to $550,000 will be available for a 24 month project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the first year of the grant, the grantee institution will use these funds to create, demonstrate and evaluate a summer
institute prototype on their campus during the summer of 1995 with follow-up assistance to Head Start staff graduates
as they implement their new skills at their local programs. Also in year one the grantee will recruit another college
or university in which to replicate the model in year two.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the second year of this grant, the grantee institution will improve the prototype program based on year-one experiences,
and will offer the hands-on science program to a new group of Head Start staff during the summer 1996. Also during the
second year, the ``A Head Start on Science'' grantee will fund for one year, and mentor another college or university
to: (1) implement the prototype ``A Head Start on Science'' model in the summer of 1996 and; (2) provide follow-up assistance
to the Head Start staff as they plan to implement their new skills in their local programs. The addition of a second institution
will provide the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness and transferability of the concept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the grant period, a third party evaluator must be secured by the grantee institution to assess the effectiveness
of the approach, content and transferability of the ``A Head Start on Science'' project. The third party evaluator
must not be involved in the conduct of the demonstration. The evaluation of the students in both institutes in the summer
of 1996 will be completed by the end of the project period. It should focus on the students' plans for the implementation
of the program and principles.

D. Project Period and Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of approximately $550,000 in ACF funds will be available to fund the demonstration project for a 24 month period.
Applicants must propose how much will be needed for each 12 month period of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee must provide at least 20 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $550,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of approximately $275,000 per budget period) must provide
&sect;137,500 in cash or in-kind contributions (20% of total project costs of $687,500).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of deadlines: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, the Department is required to submit to OMB for
review and approval any reporting and record keeping requirements in regulations, including program announcements.
This program announcement does not contain information collection requirements beyond those approved for ACF grant
applications under OMB Control Number 0348&hyph;0043.

G. Executive Order 12372_Notification Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR
Part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
Executive Order 12372, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa, and Palau
have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs).
Applicants from these 19 jurisdictions areas need not take action regarding Executive Order 12372. Applications
for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are exempt from the requirements of Executive
Order 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective
application and to receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOC
as early as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is
imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal
(or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPOCs have 30 days from the application deadline date to comment on applications submitted under this announcement.
We are requesting a shortened period for SPOC review. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine
endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between
mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate
or explain'' rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W., 6th
floor, Aerospace Building, Washington, D.C. 20447. ACF will notify the State of any application received which has
no indication that the State process has had an opportunity for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of SPOCs for each State and territory is included at Appendix A at the end of this announcement.

This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a&hyph;k of Section B.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall purpose of the program is to work toward the ultimate goal of reducing exposures to hazardous substances
and mitigating potential adverse health effects from such exposures. Applications should describe how progress
toward this goal will be measured. This program will assist State health or environmental departments to identify,
develop, disseminate, and evaluate appropriate educational materials and programs on the potential health effects,
prevention, medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosis and treatment of injury or disease related
to exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. Special emphasis will be placed on exposures found at or near
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites, and other sites identified by ATSDR's Health Activities
Recommendation Panel (HARP). See Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP) below for a description of HARP.
(Superfund sites are defined as sites on, or proposed to be on, the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL)). HARP sites
include petitioned sites and consultation sites, in addition to NPL sites. A list of HARP-recommended sites will
be included with the application package. Following are definitions or descriptions of the activities to be performed:

Site-Specific Preventive Health Education_An activity designed to address health risks in a community where presenting
specific information or recommendations can assist the community in understanding, preventing, or mitigating
the health effects of hazardous substances exposure. Target audiences are community members and health professionals.
Preventive health education related to sites should be integral to the entire public health activities process and
not simply performed when all other activities are completed. Sites for health education should be selected based
on public health need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following describes the two types of site-specific preventive health education activities.

Community Health Education_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any activity or activities directed toward the community near a site, designed to assist the community in understanding
their potential for exposure or assessing adverse health occurrence in their community and to prevent or mitigate
exposure to hazardous substances. Activities may include disseminating written materials, presenting coordinated
programs involving on-site actions and site-specific materials development (prevention oriented), or supporting
an on site health educator. It is assumed that in community health education, community members are involved in the
assessment, policy development, and assurance phases of site-specific preventive health education.

12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications.
Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point
of Contacts (SPOCs) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and to receive any necessary
instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to
contact the SPOC for each affected State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any
State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Henry S. Cassell, III,
Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Atlanta, GA 30305, no later than 30 days after the application
deadline date. (A waiver for the 60-day requirement has been requested.) The granting agency does not guarantee to
``accommodate or explain'' State process recommendations it receives after that date.

CERCLA as amended by SARA, provides for the recovery of costs incurred for response actions at each Superfund site
from potentially responsible parties. The recipient would agree to maintain an accounting system that will keep
an accurate, complete, and current accounting of all financial transactions on a site-specific basis, i.e., individual
time, travel, and associated cost including indirect cost, as appropriate for the site. The recipient would also
maintain documentation that describes the site-specific response actions taken with respect to the site, e.g.,
contracts, work assignments, progress reports, and other documents that describe the work performed at a site. The
recipient will retain the documents and records to support these financial transactions and documentation of work
performed, for possible use in a cost recovery case, for a minimum of ten (10) years after submission of a final Financial
Status Report (FSR), unless there is litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the specific
site, then the records will be maintained until resolution of all issues on the specific site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. State or incorporate by reference all applicable requirements imposed on the contractors under the terms of the
grant and/or cooperative agreement, including requirements concerning technical review (ATSDR selected reviewers),
ownership of data, and the arrangement for copyright when publications, data, or other copyrightable works are developed
under or in the course of work under a PHS grant-supported project or activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. State that whenever any work subject to this copyright policy may be developed in the course of a grant by a contractor
under a grant, the written agreement (contract) must require the contractor to comply with these requirements and
can in no way diminish the government's right in that work.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Great Lakes Human Health Effects Program is authorized under
section 106, Subsection 118(e) of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 [33 U.S.C. 1268(e)(3)], and Sections
104(i)(5)(A) and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(5)(A) and (15)].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in
consultation with ATSDR and the Great Lakes States, to initiate a research program and submit a report to Congress
assessing the harmful human health effects of water pollutants in the Great Lakes basin. The ATSDR Great Lakes Human
Health Effects Research Program focuses on populations that have been identified as having a higher risk of long-term
adverse health effects from exposure to Great Lakes contaminants in fish. They include Native Americans, sport anglers,
urban poor, and fetuses and nursing infants of mothers who consume contaminated Great Lakes fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1992, ATSDR awarded nine research grants designed to investigate and characterize the association between
the consumption of contaminated Great Lakes fish and potential long-term adverse health effects. The draft ATSDR
annual report for FY 1992 describes the Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program's strategy, and the research
activities and status of the nine awarded grants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements for State Injury Intervention Programs. These programs will develop, implement, and evaluate
multi-faceted, injury prevention and/or surveillance programs to reduce the incidence of injuries and deaths in
the following areas: bicycle-related head injuries, fire-related burn injuries, motor vehicle injuries, firearm-related
injuries, violence against women, and alcohol-related injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
described in ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve
the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Violent and Abusive Behavior and Unintentional
Injuries. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the Section

Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $3,500,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund up to twenty projects to implement and evaluate injury intervention
and surveillance programs in five priority areas: bicycle-related head injuries (4&hyph;5 to be awarded), fire-related
burn injuries (4&hyph;5 to be awarded), motor vehicle injuries (4&hyph;5 to be awarded), firearm-related injuries
(6 to be awarded), and alcohol-related injuries (1 to be awarded). Awards are expected to range from $150,000 to $200,000
with an average award of $175,000 for each 12-month budget period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, approximately $750,000 will be available to fund up to three projects to perform activities for the prevention
of violence against women. Awards are expected to range from $225,000 to $275,000, with an average award of $250,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds are expected to be awarded on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period. Programs

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to enable State public health agencies to implement and evaluate priority
injury prevention and control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. Specifically, State public health agencies may submit applications to develop programs in EACH OR ANY
of six areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Prevention of bicycle-related head injuries through increased usage of bicycle helmets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Prevention of fire-related burns through increased installation and utilization of smoke detectors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased usage of occupant protection, including seat belts, child
safety seats, and air bags; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identification of firearm-related injuries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Identification and prevention of violence against women; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Identification and prevention of alcohol-related injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs in any of these six areas will develop, implement, and evaluate targeted activities designed to accurately
measure and reduce morbidity, mortality, severity, disability, and costs associated with injuries. This funding
will allow the applicant to establish or strengthen a lead capacity for prevention and control of the targeted injury
(e.g., bicycle-related head injuries). It is expected that any program developed will function as a component of
the public health agency's injury control program, will coordinate related activities both within the agency and
within the jurisdiction, and will mobilize, seek input from, and utilize broad coalitions.

 I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is committed to carrying out a program to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. One aspect
of this program involves regulatory activities under the laws administered by the agency concerning the design,
manufacture, and distribution of medical devices. Patient safety, however, is dependent on more than properly functioning
devices. Although proper operation, maintenance, and periodic inspection of these devices by the user are matters
that cannot always be addressed effectively through regulatory action under the laws administered by the agency,
they are essential to minimize risks to patients. Consequently, as an important adjunct to its regulatory program,
FDA has initiated a variety of educational efforts to aid medical professionals in the safe use of medical devices.
These educational endeavors are conducted in cooperation with, and usually with the active participation of, the
relevant professional organizations and other groups within the private sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, to reduce unnecessary retakes in radiology and to improve image quality, FDA, in cooperation with the
American College of Radiology and other private sector organizations, developed voluntary recommendations for
radiology facilities concerning equipment quality assurance programs (``A Basic Quality Assurance Program for
Small Diagnostic Radiology Facilities,'' FDA 83&hyph;8218). In cooperation with the American College of Radiology
and numerous other medical professional societies, FDA also fostered the development of guides for clinicians on
the effective use of selected diagnostic imaging procedures (``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations,''
FDA 80&hyph;8104; ``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations: The Pelvimetry Examination,'' FDA 81&hyph;8174;
``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations: Chest X-ray Screening and Examination,'' FDA 83&hyph;8204).
As an adjunct to the teaching of medical students and radiology residents, FDA funded the development of a basic teaching
system in radiology, ``The Radiological Health Sciences Learning File,'' which is now in use in radiology education
and is used in 118 medical schools in the United States and in several foreign medical schools as well. These examples
illustrate FDA's commitment to ensuring that users of medical devices are sufficiently educated and motivated to
use medical devices safely and effectively.

II. Scope of the 1993 Recommendations Document
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recommendations document that the agency is now making available a revised version of the draft document entitled
``Draft Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1992,'' that was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 6, 1992 (57 FR 46033), and that was based on the original document entitled ``Draft Anesthesia Apparatus
Checkout Recommendations,'' that was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 27, 1987 (52 FR 5583). FDA also intends to make this document available to anesthesia clinicians through
their professional organizations and to anesthesia equipment manufacturers so that they may include it in their
user education programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommendations in ``Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1993'' should be followed for anesthesia
systems that conform to current and relevant standards (such as ``Standard Specifications for Minimum Performance
and Safety Requirements for Components and Systems of Anesthesia Gas Machines,'' ASTM F&hyph;1161&hyph;88) and
that include an ascending bellows ventilator and at least the following monitors: Capnograph, pulse oximeter, oxygen
analyzer, respiratory volume monitor (spirometer) and breathing system pressure monitor with high and low pressure
alarms. However, the recommendations document offers guidance that users are encouraged to modify to accommodate
differences in equipment design and variations in local clinical practice. Such local modifications should have
appropriate peer review. The original recommendations document (52 FR 5583) should be followed for other anesthesia
systems. Users should refer to the operators manual for specific procedures and precautions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the draft document entitled ``Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1992'' (57 FR 46033),
eight comments were received and reviewed by the agency. Some minor refinements were made to the checkout recommendations
in response to the comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the pre-use inspection procedure provided in the checkout recommendations will aid medical professionals
in the safe use of anesthesia devices. FDA regards the pre-use inspection procedure to be a recommendation as defined
in &sect;10.90(c) (21 CFR 10.90(c)). Therefore, the checklist is being made available under &sect;10.90(c) of the
agency's administrative practices and procedures regulations. That regulation provides for FDA to formulate and
disseminate recommendations about matters that are authorized by, but do not involve direct regulatory action under,
the laws administered by the agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued to the North Carolina
Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, University of North Carolina School
of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, for the manufacture of Source Plasma.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA conducted an inspection of the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory between July 30 and August 15, 1991. The inspection
documented serious deviations from the applicable Federal regulations and the biologics standards in the firm's
license. Deviations identified during the inspection included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) Failure
to adequately determine donor suitability, in that: (a) three donors who admitted to a history of hepatitis, liver
disease, or jaundice were regularly accepted for Source Plasma donation (21 CFR 640.63(c)(11)); (b) two donors who
previously tested repeatedly reactive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) continued to be accepted for donation,
despite having never met the established criteria for donor reentry as described in the December 2, 1987, FDA HBsAg
protocol (21 CFR 610.41); (c) two donors who failed to donate for a period of 6 months were not processed as new donors
(21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(iii)); and (d) five donors did not have serum protein electrophoresis testing performed every
4 months (21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(i)); (2) failure to limit the frequency of Source Plasma donation to two times within
a 7-day period, in that at least two donors were allowed to donate three times in a 7-day period (21 CFR 640.65(b)(5));
(3) failure to observe, standardize, and calibrate equipment used in the collection, processing, and distribution
of blood components (21 CFR 606.60); (4) failure to maintain adequate and complete standard operating procedures
for all steps in the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of blood components (21 CFR 606.100(b));
and (5) failure to report important changes in responsible personnel or manufacturing methods to FDA's Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 601.12 (a) and (b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA determined that the deviations from Federal regulations were significant and constituted a danger to public
health, warranting a suspension pursuant to 21 CFR 601.6(a). In a letter to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital dated
September 3, 1991, FDA detailed the violations noted above and suspended the firm's establishment and product licenses
for the manufacture of Source Plasma. In a letter to the firm dated May 20, 1992, FDA indicated that the firm had responded
satisfactorily to FDA's September 3, 1991, suspension letter. In the same letter, FDA permitted the firm to resume
collecting and storing Source Plasma on a limited basis for the purpose of reinspection to determine compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA conducted a followup inspection of the firm between July 27 and July 29, 1992. The inspection documented several
continuing deviations from Federal regulations. These deviations included, but were not limited to, the following:
(1) Inadequate facilities to provide for the storage of blood or blood components; (2) incomplete or incorrect disposition
records; and (3) incomplete or inadequate written procedures. FDA permitted the firm to continue to collect and store
Source Plasma on a limited basis, but FDA did not permit the firm to distribute the prepared plasma until otherwise
notified by FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA attempted to conduct a reinspection of the firm on February 2, 1993, to, in part, determine the firm's status. During
this inspection, it was observed that the donor chair had been removed and that no plasma had been collected since the
inspection ending July 29, 1992. The inspection was terminated because a meaningful inspection could not be performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter to FDA dated February 10, 1993, the firm requested voluntary revocation of its licenses and thereby waived
its opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 601.5(a). The agency granted the licensee's request by letter dated August
24, 1993, which revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license for the manufacture
of Source Plasma.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has placed copies of the letters relevant to the license revocation on file under the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. These documents include the following: FDA letters of September
3, 1991, May 20, 1992, and August 24, 1993; and the firm's letter of February 10, 1993. These documents are available
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), 21 CFR 601.5, and under authority
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director, Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.68), the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued
to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, for the manufacture
of Source Plasma were revoked, effective August 24, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of recombinant human interleukin 10 (rhIL&hyph;10) has been discovered to be a new potential means of treating
HIV infection. In vitro studies with rhIL&hyph;10 have shown it to be an inhibitor of HIV infection in human monocytes
and macrophages as well as having activity against HIV in certain T-cell and monocyte cell lines. This activity against
HIV occurs both at the time of infection and when added to previously infected cell cultures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These effects occur at IL&hyph;10 concentrations that are lower than those which inhibit other immune functions.
In addition, the use of IL&hyph;10 to interfere with HIV replication is expected to result in the amelioration of Kaposi's
sarcoma.

Novel nonpeptidic compounds designed to be inhibitors of the HIV protease enzyme have been discovered. These compounds
thus have potential as possible pharmaceutical compositions for the inhibition HIV replication and the treatment
of AIDS. Based upon SS isomers of substituted dibenzyl-5-hydroxyl-2-primidones, these compounds are expected
to not have the problems associated with current peptide-based protease inhibitors such as poor oral absorption,
poor stability, and rapid metabolism and elimination.

Novel conformationally constrained peptide polymer HIV vaccine candidates have been uncovered that generate a
strong humoral immune response not seen against monomeric peptides. Termed ``peptomers'', these candidates are
composed of specifically cross-linked synthetic peptide sequences from the highly conserved CD4 binding domains
of the gp120 regions of HIV&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HIV&hyph;2. Although peptides from these regions of gp120 do not possess any conformation in solution, the polymerized
forms were found to have conformations that resemble the theoretical conformations that might be found in these regions
of the native gp120 from HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2. Certain peptomers from HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2 bind CD4, the
cell receptor for HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2, and induce antibody responses in rabbits and rhesus monkeys that block
in vitro HIV&hyph;1 infection.

Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,
disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based
on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases.

On October 22, 1974, the U.S. District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Court for the Western District of Washington in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Weinberger, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash. October 22, 1974) stopped SSA from recovering overpaid Social Security benefits without
giving each member of the plaintiff class adequate written notice of the overpayment determination, the right to
contest such determination and the right to a pre-recoupment hearing. Moreover, the court stopped SSA from taking
any action to recover the overpayments before affording the class member the opportunity for a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court ordered that the written notice must include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement of the alleged overpayment, an explanation of the basis for the overpayment and SSA's proposed
action to recover the overpayment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement of the individual's right to a pre-recoupment hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructions and forms for requesting a pre-recoupment hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation that if the person did not request a pre-recoupment hearing within 30 days of the date of mailing
of the overpayment notice, it would be presumed that the person waived his/her right to the hearing and recovery of
the alleged overpayment would begin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement of any other administrative relief available (i.e., reconsideration of the fact and/or amount
of overpayment and waiver of recovery of the overpayment); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement that the local SSA office would help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court also ordered the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. SSA had to restore all benefits withheld from the named plaintiffs pending an opportunity for a pre-recoupment
hearing. The person had to be given the opportunity to examine his/her claims file at least 5 days prior to the date of
the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The pre-recoupment hearing had to be conducted by an SSA employee who had no prior knowledge of the events leading
to the overpayment determination and the decision to recover the overpayment. At the hearing the person requesting
waiver had to be given the opportunity to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Personally appear, testify, and cross-examine any witnesses;

&bull;Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submit documents for consideration at the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court, however, did not require that a transcript be made of the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. After the hearing, SSA had to issue a written decision to the individual (and his/her representative, if any) specifying
the findings of fact and conclusions in support of the decision to approve or deny waiver and advising of the individual's
right to appeal the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the court order, SSA began to issue overpayment notices containing all of the aforementioned information
and to offer pre-recoupment hearings to all class members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 20, 1979, the Supreme Court held in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Califano v. Yamasaki, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
442 U.S. 682 (1979), that individuals who filed a written request for waiver were entitled to the opportunity for a
pre-recoupment oral hearing, but those who requested only reconsideration were not so entitled. Thereafter, SSA
applied its revised overpayment notice and pre-recoupment hearing procedures to all individuals who are determined
to be overpaid under the title II or Black Lung programs.

No 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) required SSA to automatically schedule pre-recoupment hearings for persons whose
request for waiver of overpayment recovery could not be approved after initial paper review. On February 10, 1983,
the court in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved procedures developed by SSA in response to the 1981 decree whereby pre-recoupment
hearings would be automatically scheduled provided that the scheduling would be in writing. The scheduling letter
had to contain all the necessary information about the date, time, and place of the hearing; the procedure for reviewing
the file prior to the hearing; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled date, time, or place; and all other
information necessary to fully inform the claimant about the pre-recoupment hearing. SSA began to automatically
schedule pre-recoupment hearings in writing in April 1983.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Bowen, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved SSA's plan to transfer waiver decisionmaking authority from the processing
centers to the field offices for Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments. SSA implemented this change in
July 1988.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overpayment Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the court decisions, when an overpayment is discovered, the person is immediately notified. The
notice includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The overpayment amount and how and when it occurred; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A request for full, immediate refund, unless the overpayment can be withheld from the next month's benefit;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The proposed adjustment of benefits if refund is not received within 30 days after the date of the notice and
adjustment of benefits is available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation of the availability of a different rate of withholding when full withholding is proposed, installment
payments when refund is requested and adjustment is not currently available, and/or cross-program recovery when
refund is requested and the person is receiving another type of benefit from SSA (cross-program recovery is not available
to residents of New York and Pennsylvania); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation of the right to request waiver of recovery and the automatic scheduling of a folder review and
pre-recoupment hearing (commonly referred to as a personal conference) if a request for waiver cannot be approved
after initial paper review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructions about the availability of forms for requesting reconsideration and waiver; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation that if the person does not request waiver or reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the
overpayment notice, recovery of the overpayment will begin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation of the right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement that the local SSA office will help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation that the person receiving the notice should notify SSA promptly if reconsideration, waiver,
a lesser rate of withholding, repayment by installments, or cross-program adjustment is wanted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Form SSA&hyph;3105 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Form SSA&hyph;3105 (Important Information About Your Appeal and Waiver Rights) is included with each overpayment
notice. The SSA&hyph;3105 further explains the pre-recoupment review process and contains a tear-off form which
the person may complete and return to SSA if he/she wants reconsideration and/or waiver.

Delaying Recovery of the Overpayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure meaningful opportunity to contest the correctness of an overpayment determination and/or establish entitlement
to waiver, the date on which full refund is due and, if appropriate, the date on which adjustment will begin must be at
least 30 days after the date of the overpayment notice. If the individual responds within 30 days after the date of the
overpayment notice, SSA must take action to ensure that benefit payments are not interrupted. If the 30-day period
cannot be assured, SSA must postpone any proposed recoupment for a longer period. Anytime waiver is requested, SSA
stops recovery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Requesting Waiver
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When waiver is requested, the individual gives SSA information (usually on Form SSA&hyph;632&hyph;BK (Request
for Waiver of Overpayment Recovery or Change in Repayment Rate)) to support his/her contention that he/she is without
fault in causing the overpayment and that recovery would either cause financial hardship or be inequitable. That
information, along with supporting documentation, is reviewed to determine if waiver can be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Reviewing Waiver Request
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments, the waiver request is reviewed in the field office; in Disability
Insurance overpayments, it is reviewed in the processing center. If waiver cannot be approved after review of the
claims folder, the person is notified in writing and given necessary information about the dates, times, and place
of the folder review and personal conference; the procedure for reviewing the claims folder prior to the personal
conference; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled dates, times, or place; and all other information
necessary to fully inform the person about the personal conference. The folder review is always scheduled at least
5 days before the personal conference.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Folder Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the folder review, the person and/or the person's representative has the right to review the claims folder and applicable
law and regulations with the decisionmaker or another SSA representative who is prepared to answer questions. The
individual can get copies of any requested material from the claims folder or pertinent sections of the law or regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal Conference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the personal conference, the person is given the opportunity to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Personally appear, testify, cross-examine any witnesses, and make arguments;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submit documents for consideration by the decisionmaker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decisionmaker:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tells the person that the decisionmaker was not previously involved in the issue under review, that the waiver
decision is solely the decisionmaker's, and that the waiver decision is based only on the evidence or information
presented or reviewed at the conference;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertains the role and identity of everyone present;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indicates whether or not the person reviewed the claims file;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explains the provisions of law and regulations applicable to the issue;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Briefly summarizes the evidence already in file which will be considered;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertains from the person whether the information presented is correct and whether he/she fully understands
it;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allows the person and the person's representative, if any, to present the person's case;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Secures updated financial information, if necessary;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allows each witness to present information and allows the person and the person's representative, if any,
to question the witness;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertains whether there is any further evidence to be presented;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reminds the person of any evidence promised by the person which has not been presented;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lets the person and the person's representative, if any, present any final summary or closing statement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explains that a decision will be made and the person will be notified in writing; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explains further appeal rights in the event the decision is adverse to the person.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The City of Cedar Park (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit
pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number
PRT&hyph;788842. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroica chrysoparia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction and operation of a water pipeline, in Travis County,
Texas. The proposed development will eliminate about 4.2 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will not be made
before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the
Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are at 50 CFR 17.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant plans to construct a 20,193-foot long water supply pipeline from Lake Travis eastward to the Williamson
County line. An Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan has been prepared for the project. As mitigation
for the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler, the Applicant proposes to preserve documented perch trees
for the warbler along the route; limit clearing to 35 feet wide along the route and two 100 feet by 100 feet staging areas
in non-habitat; schedule work during the season when the warblers are absent from the area (August 1 through March
1); and the purchase and dedication of 33 acres of occupied warbler habitat to a conservation organization approved
by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three because they were not economically viable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 106 of the amended Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Secretary of Labor is required to set performance
standards for programs serving: (1) adults and youth under Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C; (2) dislocated workers
under Title III; and (3) older workers under section 204(d). The Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 (Amendments)
also introduced significant changes in the way job training programs are designed and operated at the local levels.
These statutory changes, combined with recent legislative and administrative initiatives to promote high-quality,
results-driven, customer-oriented services throughout the Federal Government, are not only reshaping the way
JTPA delivers its services, but also how to measure its effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
National job training objectives have remained unchanged since 1990 and focus on enhancing the long-term employability
and economic self-sufficiency of those most at risk of becoming or remaining unemployed. Current measures of the
program's progress in achieving these objectives relate directly to near-term employment and earnings levels of
adult program completers and levels of employment and skill enhancements of youth program completers. These outcomes
do not, by themselves, measure the quality of the services received or the extent to which the program is able to improve
upon participants' prior employment, earnings and welfare dependency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, the Department will be undertaking a comprehensive review of its performance standards over the
next year to examine alternative program measures and more cost efficient ways of assessing the program's long-term
effects on its graduates. Ongoing surveys of JTPA's customers will also provide invaluable feedback on how helpful
JTPA services are to its users, what other services are needed but not provided by the program, and the extent to which
good outcomes are related to levels of customer satisfaction. Finally, the Employment and Training Administration
will initiate a nationwide JTPA Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human
resource investments in terms of obtaining high-quality employment for those participants most at-risk of failure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outcome measures for Title II&hyph;A and C will be retained until this performance standards review is completed.
Numerical levels for these core standards have been updated to reflect the most recent JTPA program experience.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its Title III programs; therefore, changes in outcome
measures will be deferred until the results of this critical assessment are available. Governors will continue to
be required to set an entered employment rate standard for their Title III programs and are encouraged to establish
an average wage at placement goal. At the same time, the Department will be exploring ways to use performance standards
to improve the quality of services provided to dislocated workers, and to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 204(d) of JTPA, older worker programs are now subject to performance standards. However, no incentive
awards or sanctions are associated with these standards. Outcomes for these programs focus on increasing employment
and earnings similar to those programs serving other disadvantaged adults. Because field evidence suggests that
older workers are much more likely to remain employed once they are placed in jobs, employment and wages will be measured
at program completion rather than at a later follow-up period. Together, these measures underscore the employment
focus of the program, particularly in jobs that are higher paying.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with the legislative provisions, the Department considered adding specific outcome measures for hard-to-serve
participants and separate outcomes for in-school and out-of-school youth. In the interest of avoiding a proliferation
of performance measures and limiting local flexibility in programming, additional measures for these three separate
groups were not established. Rather, the requirement to promote services to hard-to-serve individuals will be addressed
from an incentive policy perspective and the issue of in-school and out-of-school standards will continue to be addressed
through the performance standards adjustment process. When judging service delivery area (SDA) performance and
awarding incentive funds, States will need to design incentive policies that will promote more effective services
to out-of-school youth and reward placements into jobs with employer-assisted benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy of excluding cost measures from incentive awards will remain unchanged; however, States are reminded
of the integral role of financial oversight in program management. States are also encouraged to utilize available
administrative data to relate overall costs of job training to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings
and reductions in welfare. The Office of the Inspector General will be collaborating with ETA in developing a mechanism
for measuring the program's return on its investments. The wider JTPA community will also be invited to participate
in this effort.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 1, 1994, proposed revisions to the performance standards for JTPA Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Title
III, and newly instituted section 204(d) performance standards were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 9910. Interested parties were invited to submit written comments through March 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor (DOL) received 96 written comments on the proposed performance standards issuance. Eighteen
of the letters explicitly endorsed the overall direction which the Department is taking in establishing performance
standards policy for Program Years 1994 and 1995. In general, the majority of comments requested clarifications
or raised issues about specific aspects of the proposed requirements. While the concept of imposing a hard-to-serve
``gate'' for incentive awards eligibility received support, its application to terminees rather than enrollments
drew considerable local and State criticism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following summarizes the major issues raised by the commenters and the Department's respective responses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Participants Rather Than Terminees as the Basis for Determining SDA Eligibility for Incentive Awards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department specifically sought comments on whether the hard-to-serve ``gate'' for incentive award eligibility
fully addresses the need to emphasize this population in the performance standards system, and whether compliance
with the gate should be measured against those enrolled in training or those completing the program. A majority of
those commenting on this issue agreed with the Department's approach of restricting eligibility for incentive awards
to those programs that enroll in training at least a minimum (65%) hard-to-serve adults as well as youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, fully three-fourths of States and SDAs submitting comments specifically recommended that the basis for
the gate should be participants (all individuals served during the year, including those still enrolled at the end
of the program year) rather than terminees. Basing the 65% hard-to-serve level on program terminees was seen as pressuring
SDAs to ``manipulate'' their terminations. Local programs can manage the recruitment process to ensure that adequate
numbers of hard-to-serve are enrolled. Ensuring comparable numbers of hard-to-serve individuals will graduate
each year is more problematic because of the clients' varying training needs. Participants with multiple barriers
typically need to remain in programs longer than those with fewer barriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concurs with the arguments made for changing the basis of the incentive award ``gate'' from terminations
to participants. Particularly compelling is the rationale that hard-to-serve participants need longer-term interventions
and the adverse effects that such a gate might create in prompting SDAs to terminate participants prematurely. Thus,
beginning in FY 1994 for SDAs to become eligible for incentives, at least 65 percent of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the SDAs' Title II&hyph;A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title II&hyph;C (in-school and out-of-school combined) participants receiving training, and/or other services
beyond objective assessment, must be hard-to-serve. For the purpose of determining compliance with this requirement,
those individuals with SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor are to be included as well as participants
in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in five percent-funded projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further reinforce JTPA's focus on serving hard-to-serve participants, the Department encourages Governors
to design incentive policies that explicitly promote increased service to that group. For example, Governors may
wish to adjust themselves based on the degree to which SDAs exceed the incentive eligibility ``gate'' or on a sliding
scale of continuous improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Improved Service to Out-of-School Youth and Employer-Assisted Benefits Incentive Award Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
About 30 percent of all commenters mentioned this issue. Most of the comments requested additional guidance and clarification
on how these two items could be incorporated into incentive award policies and asked whether Governors could ignore
or ``zero weight'' either one of them in the awarding of incentives. The Department is sensitive to concerns about
establishing incentive criteria without sufficient information on the program's prior experience in placing individuals
in jobs with employer-assisted benefits; or in the case of out-of-school youth, in the absence of effective program
models that have a positive impact on a youth's long-term earnings potential.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the field comments several changes have been made to the incentive policy guidance as originally proposed.
First, Governors will be encouraged, but not required, to include these criteria in State incentive policy for PY
1994. States will be required to incorporate these criteria (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) beginning in PY
1995. In the interim States can use data from the Standardized Program Information Reports (SPIR) for PYs 1992 and
1993 to establish performance benchmarks for programs serving out-of-school youth and job placements providing
employer-assisted benefits. Therefore, the Department is giving Governors maximum flexibility in terms of how
these criteria may be applied. Suggested approaches for rewarding improved service to out-of-school youth and placements
in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits will be included in the Training and Employment Guidance Letter appended
to this Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that the intent of the incentive provisions is to encourage service to more out-of-school
youth; thus, SDAs should be rewarded solely on the extent to which they exceed the statutory minimum service levels.
The Department's position is that rewarding SDAs simply on the basis of increasing the numbers of out-of-school youth
does not go far enough in addressing the disappointing findings from the National JTPA study. Thus, while SDAs will
not be exempted from the statutory requirement to serve at least 50% out-of-school youth, ETA is encouraging States
to use incentive funds to pilot innovative youth models and to evaluate and replicate promising strategies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
20-Hour Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(k) of JTPA requires for performance standards purposes that employment be for at least 20 or more hours
per week. This requirement applies to Title II&hyph;A (adults), Title II&hyph;C (youth), Section 204(d) (older
workers), and Title III (dislocated workers) programs. About 15 percent of the comments questioned the reasonableness
of this requirement for in-school youth, older workers, or disabled participants, and requested that the Department
waive it in these cases. Since this requirement is explicitly defined 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in the statute, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it cannot be waived.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also requested clarification about the reference period, i.e., whether a ``week'' means 5 or
7 days and whether follow-up is needed to verify that an individual actually worked for at least 20 hours. For determining
compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood
as a condition of employment. (See section 5 of the attached TEGL.) No formal verification is required, but the Department
encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking to assess compliance by SDAs.

Definition of ``Failure to Meet Standards''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(j)(i)(A) of JTPA requires the Secretary to establish uniform criteria of determining whether a service
delivery area fails to meet performance standards. To comply with this provision, the Department specified the number
of failed standards which constitute overall failure. Commenters generally agreed with the concept of a uniform
definition of performance failure; however, there was minor opposition to defining overall failure as missing a
combination of any three standards or simply missing both youth standards. The Department was criticized for placing
too much weight on the youth standards. Given Congressional interest in improving the quality of service to youth,
as reflected in various provisions in the amended JTPA, and given the need to respond to the programmatic issues raised
by the National JTPA Study, the Department believes its emphasis on youth program performance is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification on whether SDAs had to fail the same standards two consecutive years
to trigger a reorganization. The sanction policy does not apply to the same standards over the two-year period. Thus,
for the purpose of identifying whether an SDA has failed to meet performance standards for two consecutive years,
overall failure means failing any three core standards or both youth standards for two consecutive years. Definitions

Performance Standards for Older Worker Programs Under Section 204(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other major area of comment involved the performance standards for older worker programs under Section 204(d).
A total of 27 letters was received from advocates/service providers and State agencies on aging. These letters questioned
the methodology and data used for setting the performance standards levels. Many indicated that the proposed levels
were too high, particularly the level of the average wage at placement standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since March 1, 1994, when the notice appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, additional data became available from the PY 1992 SPIR. Reported information on the Section 204(d) Older Worker
program was analyzed and used to establish revised levels for the standards that are more closely related to actual
experience for that program. This has resulted in a lower entered employment rate standard, but the average wage at
placement standard remains unchanged. It should be remembered, however, that the Secretary's standards are merely

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
departure points
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which will be adjusted to account for local economic conditions and the characteristics of the terminees. The Department
will be providing States with a methodology for making these adjustments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance Standards Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 9 comments was received about the overall performance levels for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C standards.
Comments were mixed with hard-to-serve advocates supporting both higher and lower levels. The majority of comments
advocating lower levels were from youth advocates who felt that the standard for youth employment was too high given
the recent decline in the rate of placing youth in jobs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The numerical values of the standards are generally set so that if local programs continue to perform unchanged from
the prior program year, 75 percent of the system are expected to exceed their standards. The proposed numerical standards
for five of the six core measures (all but the YEER) and the Title III Entered Employment Rate measure are set in this
manner, using PY 1992 performance. Further adjustments were made to reflect the new 20 hour per week minimum requirement
for employment. To arbitrarily raise the level of all standards, as suggested by certain advocate groups, appeared
counterproductive when the Department was imposing new targeting requirements and employment caveats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One exception is the numerical standard for the YEER which if similarly set, would lead to reduced standards for SDAs.
The recently published 30-month results from the National JTPA Study suggest that employment and earnings experienced
by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to foster improved services to out-of-school
youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary's standards for the new older worker performance measures were derived from an analysis of available
PY 1992 Section 204(d) data from the SPIR. The same general rules that were used for setting the levels for the Titles
II&hyph;A, II&hyph;C, and III programs, including the adjustment for 20-hour employment, were used for the Section
204(d) program. Again, it must be emphasized that these national standards are merely departure points and States
must make adjustments to account for local conditions.

This issuance is procedural in character and gives directions to States and local service deliverers on the implementation
of performance standards under Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Section 204(d), and Title III of JTPA. Therefore,
it is not classified as ``major'' under Executive Order 12291 and no impact analysis is required. This issuance has
been assessed according to the Federalist policymaking criteria outlined in Executive Order 12612. The Department
believes that this issuance will not materially limit the policymaking discretion of the States. This issuance both
addresses Departmental policy objectives and permits States discretionary authority in the application of performance
standards. The procedural framework included in this issuance enables States to better assist localities in more
effective and efficient program design and management.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To transmit guidance on the Secretary's required performance measures and the Secretary's implementing instructions
for performance standards for Program Years (PY's) 1994 and 1995 (July 1, 1994&hyph;June 30, 1995; July 1, 1995&hyph;June
30, 1996). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sec. 106 of JTPA, as amended, directs the Secretary to establish performance standards for adult, youth, and dislocated
worker programs. These standards may be updated every two years based on the most recent JTPA program experience,
as well as program emphases and goals established by the Department of Labor. The Secretary also issues instructions
for implementing standards and parameter criteria for States to follow in adjusting the Secretary's standards for
service delivery areas (SDAs) and substate areas (SSAs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Job Training Reform Amendments (JTRA) of 1992 mandated significant changes in the design and operation of local
job training programs, as well as the criteria used to assess their performance. Revised Section 106 requires that
performance standards for Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Section 204(d) and Title III programs measure the number
of job placements that provide a minimum of 20 hours of work per week, and that programs be rewarded based on high performance,
increased service to the ``hard-to-serve,'' and quality job placements that are both high-paying and offer employer-assisted
benefits. Incentive and sanction policies are to be structured around more explicit criteria, and performance standards
failure is now federally defined to ensure greater uniformity in assessing underperformance nationwide. As a result
of the JTPA amendments, section 204(d) now mandates performance measures for the older worker program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in responding to the substantive changes required in the section 106 amendments, a Technical
Workgroup was convened in Washington, DC, in mid-July 1993. The workgroup had representatives from State and local
JTPA programs; public interest groups, including the Partnership for Training and Employment Careers; the U.S.
Conference of Mayors; the National Association of Counties; the National Governors' Association; and the National
Council on the Aging; and staff from the Department of Labor (DOL) Office of the Inspector General. This Guidance Letter
incorporates, to a large extent, the workgroup's findings.

Performance Management Goals for PY's 1994&hyph;1995.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Departmental goals, initially established for PY 1990 in anticipation of the amendments, remain unchanged and are
as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Targeting services to a more at-risk population;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Improving the quality and intensity of services that lead to skills acquisition, long-term employability and increased
earnings;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Placing greater emphasis on basic skills acquisition to qualify for employment or advanced education or training;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Promoting comprehensive, coordinated human resource programs to address the multiple needs of at-risk populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, with the passage of the 1992 JTPA Amendments, the performance management system has been tasked, through
its performance incentive policies, to improve service to out-of-school youth and also to foster employment in better
quality jobs which offer high wages and employer-assisted benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These goals are reflected in the Secretary's six Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C (core) measures, national numerical
standards for these measures, new incentive award criteria, and associated reporting requirements. Governors
still retain authority to establish additional standards which reflect State policy and to develop the specific
approach to determining incentive awards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issuance specifies the national standards for PY's 1994&hyph;1995 and introduces the new criteria which must
be a part of State incentive grant policies. Data to support additional non-cost measures will continue to be reported
and Governors may use these measures, or others in making State incentive award determinations. Data on costs together
with program performance will provide critical information for State monitoring, fiscal oversight, and assist
States in measuring returns on their human resource investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has identified two additional goals for PY 1994&hyph;1995. These are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Establishing a strong customer focus and orientation toward improving the program's responsiveness in meeting
the individual needs of participants; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Seeking and using customer feedback to monitor the appropriateness of JTPA services and to promote continuous program
improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States and SDAs are encouraged to survey customers on a regular basis as an integral part of their program oversight
to identify program weaknesses and to improve program services. Technical assistance will be made available on cost-effective
ways to gather and utilize such information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Explanation of Performance Standards Levels
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C numerical standards were derived from PY 1992 aggregate performance data reported
on the JTPA Annual Status Report (JASR) and are generally set at a minimally-acceptable level that approximately
75% of the SDA's can be expected to exceed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the numerical standard for the Youth Entered Employment Rate (YEER) in the same way would lead to reduced
standards for SDAs. However, recent National JTPA Study results suggest that employment and earnings experienced
by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to encourage improved services to out-of-school
youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earnings standards have been adjusted to account for expected future inflation. Finally, an additional special
adjustment has been made to employment-related standards to account for the requirement in section 106(k) that permits
credit, for performance standards purposes, only for employment that is scheduled for 20 or more hours per week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to the Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C standards, the Title III standard was derived from PY 1992 performance
data reported on the Worker Adjustment Program Annual Program Report (WAPR). This standard is set at a level that,
approximately, 75 percent of the substate areas can be expected to exceed. As with the employment measures for Titles
II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since discrete aggregate data were not available for PY 1992 Section 204(d) Older Worker program performance, available
SPIR data were used to assist in setting performance standards levels for that program. As with the employment measures
for Titles II&hyph;A, II&hyph;C, and III, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment
requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Programs operated under section 204(d) are State programs even though they may be managed by various local entities.
Therefore, performance standards will be applied to the total older worker programs State-wide. Unlike the adult
and youth programs under Title II&hyph;A/C, however, no incentive awards or sanctions are associated with these
standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors are required to set, for each SDA, a numerical performance standard
for each of the six Secretary's measures; for the Older Worker program, Governors are required to set numerical Entered
Employment Rate and Average Wage at Placement standards for programs operated under section 204(d); for Title III,
Governors are required to set for each substate area a numerical performance standard for the Entered Employment
Rate and are encouraged to establish an Average Wage at Placement goal

The Department offers Governors an adjustment methodology that conforms both to these parameters and to the requirement
in section 106(d). This methodology covers Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C Section 204(d), and Title III programs
and will be provided to States in a soon-to-be issued Training and Employment Information Notice. Should the Governor
choose to use an alternate methodology, or make adjustments not addressed by the Departmental model, it must conform
to the parameter criteria and be documented in the Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plan (GCSSP) prior
to the program year to which it applies. The State Job Training Coordinating Council and, where appropriate, the State
Human Resources Investment Council must have an opportunity to consider adjustments to the Secretary's standards
and to recommend variations. To determine whether an SDA has met or exceeded a performance standard, Governors must
use actual end-of-year program data to recalculate the performance standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Performance Standards Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Governors must calculate the performance of their SDA's, SSA's, and section 204(d) programs according to the definitions
included in the Attachments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D.

Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C Incentive and Sanction Policies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Performance standards are to be established for programs funded under Titles II and III of the Act. In applying the
Secretary's standards for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the six core measures and also consider criteria relating to programs successfully serving out-of-school youth
and placement in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Governors are encouraged to begin using these criteria
in PY 1994 incentive policies; these criteria are required (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) to be incorporated
into State incentive policies beginning in PY 1995. Governors may select additional non-cost measures, such as increased
service to hard-to-serve participants, to form the basis of incentive policies as long as the following criteria
are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As the basis for making incentive awards, the Governors must use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i.e., cannot ``zero weight'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the six Secretary's core measures. Beginning in PY 1995, Governors will also be required to reward innovative
out-of-school youth program models either identified by the Department of Labor or recognized by the State as having
a demonstrated record of success, and placements in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Although successful
programs for out-of-school youth remain the cornerstone of out-of-school incentives, SDA's will still be expected
to exceed the 50 percent minimum service level to be rewarded under that criterion. Governors have considerable flexibility
in implementing the new incentive criteria. Suggested approaches to addressing these criteria are included as Attachments
3 and 4 to this TEGL. Decisions regarding the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
relative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 weight or emphasis of each core measure (e.g., the Youth Entered Employment Rate) and incentive criterion (e.g.,
placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits) in a State's incentive award formula rest with the Governor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The core measures will be the basis for identifying SDA's that are candidates for technical assistance and for imposing
sanctions. At least 75 percent of the funds set aside for performance incentives must be related to these measures
and the out-of-school youth and employer-assisted benefits criteria, in accordance with section 106(b)(7)(E).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cost standards cannot be used for incentive award purposes. However, States are reminded of the integral role of
financial reviews in program management. States are encouraged to explore ways of relating overall costs of job training
to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Incentive policies may include adjustments to incentive award amounts based upon factors such as grant size, additional
services to the hard-to-serve, intensity of service, and expenditure level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A Secretary's standard for service to the hard-to-serve, as required by section 106(b)(7)(B) of JTPA, has been
established in the form of a stand-alone eligibility criterion (``gate'') for incentive awards. In order for an SDA
to be eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 incentive award, at least 65 percent of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the SDA's (a) Title II&hyph;A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (b) Title II&hyph;C (in-school and out-of-school youth combined) participants receiving training and/or other
service beyond objective assessment must be hard-to-serve. The definitions of hard-to-serve are to be consistent
with the definitions in sections 203(b), 263(b), and 263(d) of the Act. For the purpose of determining compliance
with this requirement, Governors are to include any SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor,
as well as the characteristics of participants in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in
five percent-funded projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. For those SDA's that successfully ``pass through'' the gate, three criteria (in addition to any funds set aside
for Governors' standards) will determine the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
amount
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the incentive award: (1) exceeding the Secretary's performance standards, (2) providing quality service to out-of-school
youth, and (3) placing participants in employment that provides employer-assisted benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The definition of ``employer-assisted benefits'' is to be consistent with the SPIR definition (see Attachment
4). For the purposes of reporting and performance standards, fringe benefits count so long as they are an acknowledged
component of employment conditions, whether actually received at the time of placement or not. Thus, State incentive
policies will be structured to include benefit information for those participants who entered employment at termination,
and Governors will have considerable latitude in implementing this incentive policy requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Consistent with present DOL policy, SDA's that pass through the ``gate'' and exceed all six of the Secretary's Titles
II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
receive an incentive award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Determination of an SDA's failure to meet these standards and the consequent imposition of technical assistance
and reorganization requirements under section 106(j) will be based only on the Secretary's Title II&hyph;A and Title
II&hyph;C core measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_``Meeting Performance Standards'' overall is defined as meeting at least four of the six core standards, one of which
must be a youth standard. Conversely, overall ``Failure'' is defined as failing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
three (3) or more of the core standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
failing both youth standards. Definitions for meeting and failing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individual 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
standards will be established by Governors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Failure for the first year precludes an SDA from receiving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
incentive awards and requires Governors to provide technical assistance to the underperforming SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Failure in the second consecutive year precludes an SDA from receiving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
incentive award and requires Governors to impose a reorganization plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 106(j)(3) requires each State to report to the Secretary, not later than 90 days after the end of each program
year, the actual performance and performance standards for each SDA within that State. Within the same timeframe,
technical assistance plans developed by the State are required for each SDA ``failing'' for the first year. A 90-day
timeframe also applies to the imposition of a reorganization plan, which is mandatory when an SDA ``fails'' for a second
consecutive year. Specific procedures for the formal performance standards report and required State action will
be provided under separate cover. However, in addition to the formal annual process, there should be ongoing oversight
of SDA performance and continuous technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at addressing areas where program
performance can be improved. In addition, the Employment and Training Administration will initiate a national JTPA
Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human resource investments in terms
of high-quality employment (type of job, wages and fringe benefits) for those participants most at-risk of failure.
Further information on the content and procedures for preparing the ``report card'' will be provided separately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Governors must specify in the GCSSP their incentive award policy under section 202(c)(1)(B) and 202(c)(3)(A)
and imposition of sanctions policy under section 106(j). It is recognized that the timing of this issuance may preclude
some States from submitting complete incentive policies with their PY 1994&hyph;95 GCSSPs. States are to provide
as much information as possible in compliance with required due dates and submit a GCSSP amendment containing complete
information no later than August 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In PY 1994 and 1995, Governors will continue to have the authority to exclude pilot projects serving ``hard-to-serve''
individuals funded from the 5 percent incentive fund set-aside in computing their standards and actual performance.
States and SDA's are encouraged to use such funds to develop or replicate model programs serving out-of-school youth,
particularly those based on contextual learning models.

Those terminees who receive only objective assessment and/or supportive services (or only objective assessment
and/or supportive services and entered employment) are to be excluded from the calculation of performance outcomes
for Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, and section 204(d) older worker programs. Participants in special 5-percent-funded
projects may, at the discretion of the Governor, also be excluded from the calculation of performance outcomes for
Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C.

The Title II&hyph;A adult and welfare follow-up employment measures will continue to be based on individuals who
terminate during the first three quarters of the program year and the last quarter of the previous program year. If
the response rates for those employed at termination and those not employed at termination in an SDA differ by more
than 5 percentage points in either the adult or welfare samples, then the calculations of the follow-up outcomes for
that group must be modified to adjust for non-response bias. The following defines the Title II&hyph;C performance

 As indicated in the definitions listed above, for performance standards purposes, the term ``employment'' means
employment for 20 or more hours per week. For determining compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period
of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood as a condition of the employment. No formal verification
is required, but the Department encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking
to assess compliance by SDA's.

Attachment 3_Rewarding Model Programs for Out-of-School Youth
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the Department of Labor's high priorities is to improve the effectiveness of JTPA programs for out-of-school
youth. Results from the National JTPA Study show that outcomes achieved by out-of-school youth 30 months after entering
the program are disappointing. To implement section 107(b)(7)(C) of the amended JTPA, the Department encourages
in PY 1994, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
will require
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in PY 1995, that Governors reward out-of-school youth programs that are identified by the Department or recognized
by the State as having a demonstrated record of success. States need to develop ways to identify such programs. Possible
approaches include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Using outcomes achieved to identify successful programs. Outcomes could include both the two youth performance
measures and measures such as learning gains and earnings/retention in full-time employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternatively, States could offer SDA's ``seed money'' from incentive funds to plan/operate programs that provide
innovative or high-quality training to out-of-school youth based on criteria established by the Governor. Examples
of such criteria include training that integrates occupational and basic skills training, and training that emphasizes
acquiring job skills in demand in the emerging workplace.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:

 Whatever method is used to reward successful out-of-school youth programs, access to such incentives must be limited
to those SDA's that serve in excess of 50 percent out-of-school youth in their overall Title II&hyph;C program.

Attachment 4_Rewarding Placements in Jobs Providing Employer-Assisted Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PY 1994 is the first year Governors are asked to reward SDA's for placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits,
including health benefits. (Governors will be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to do so beginning in PY 1995.) Rewarding such placements is intended to increase the focus on overall job quality.
To include placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits in their incentive policies, States will need to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Specify how the criterion will be measured. The definition must be consistent with that for SPIR Item 35c (i.e.,
consisting of, at a minimum, health insurance benefits and coverage under Social Security or an equivalent pension
plan). Note that it is not necessary for an individual to actually receive benefits when employment begins as long
as they are an acknowledged component of employment conditions. For example, health benefits available after a waiting-period
and benefits that are refused because of availability from another source both count as employer-assisted benefits.
Examples of measures of jobs with benefits, using data from SPIR Item 35c are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_among terminees who enter employment, the percent who are in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_among 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 terminees, the percent who enter employment and are in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Determine how to reward placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits. One possible approach would require
the State to determine a departure point or benchmark to use in setting rewards levels for benefits. This departure
point would serve the same function served by the numerical national standards for the Secretary's core measures.
It would be the level that, before any adjustment for local factors, identifies rewardable performance. Under this
approach, a State would also decide whether and how the departure point should be adjusted for local clientele and
economic conditions when setting reward levels for each SDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than setting reward levels for employer-assisted benefits using a process akin to setting standards for the
Secretary's core measures, States may choose a simpler approach. Because there are no sanctions based on this criterion,
it is not absolutely necessary to set a minimally acceptable performance level. It is possible to reward SDA's at all
levels of performance on employer-assisted benefits. One way to do this would be to set aside a portion of incentive
funds to reward such placements. This reward pool could be divided among SDA's based on their proportionate share
of all placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits. This procedure is equivalent to giving a fixed amount
for each placement (i.e., the amount is the value of the pool divided by the total number of placements into jobs with
benefits in the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this approach may be viewed as favoring SDA's in areas where benefits are widely prevalent, it should be viewed
as interim until better data on employer-assisted benefits are available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the spirit of the National Performance Review, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information
Service (NTIS) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will team up to demonstrate how government
can operate more effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Audiovisual Center at NARA will be transferred to NTIS under an agreement which will consolidate much
of the Federal government's capability for audio, visual, and multimedia materials production and dissemination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a time when NARA has developed a strategic vision of its future calling for a sharpening of its focus on the archival
aspects of its programs, the need for service support for audiovisual and multimedia across government is rapidly
increasing. Merging the complimentary strengths of the NARA National Audiovisual Center with the existing NTIS
which has been congressionally mandated to collect and disseminate scientific and technical information will result
in better services to agencies and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new National Audiovisual Center at NTIS will be ideally positioned to serve as a hub for access to Federally developed
media and training materials. By combining resources with the NARA center, NTIS will now be able to provide Federal
training technology transfer services to both the public and private sectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transfer of the National Audiovisual Center from NARA to NTIS will be effective October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

10. Abstract: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend the criteria for release of patients
administered radioactive material under 10 CFR Part 35. The proposed amendment requires the licensee to provide
the patient with instructions on how to maintain doses to other individuals as low as reasonably achievable, and to
maintain a record of the released patient and the calculated total effective dose equivalent to the individual likely
to receive the highest dose. These requirements are necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health
and safety, and that dose limits to other individuals are maintained as low as reasonably achievable.

Station, Unit 1, located in Will County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Braidwood, Unit 1, Technical Specifications (TSs) to remove the condition
limiting operation of the facility to 100 days during the present fuel cycle when T

&cir;F and to restore the reactor coolant dose equivalent Iodine-131 limit to 1 microcurie per gram of coolant from
the present value of 0.35. Both the limit on permissible operational time and the reduction in the permissible level
of Iodine-131 were incorporated into the TSs by Amendment No. 50 issued to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;72
for Braidwood Station, Unit 1, on May 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Braidwood Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 imposed a 100 calendar days with T

&cir;F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of main steam line break (MSLB) leakage
predicted in Braidwood Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic
method of draft NUREG 1477, ``Voltage Based Interim Plugging for Steam Generator Tubes_Task Group Report,'' with
the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 microcurie per gram (&mu;Ci/gm) to
0.35 &mu;Ci/gm. However, WCAP 14046; ``Braidwood Unit 1 Technical Support for Cycle 5 Steam Generator Interim Plugging
Criteria'' (WCAP&hyph;14046), docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal,
has shown using the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Leakrate Correlation that projected End Of Cycle (EOC)&hyph;5
MSLB leakage is 3.1 gallons per minute (gpm) which is less than the allowable limit of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This
analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP&hyph;14046.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus the Unit 1 100-day operating limit and reactor coolant dose equivalent iodine restriction imposed by Amendment
50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 100-day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report
(SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit
derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle
operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging
criteria applied at Braidwood 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights
from the draft Braidwood Individual Plant Examination (IPE). Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June
30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final form, it is believed that the quantification in hand is sufficiently robust
to allow a validation assessment of the impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in
the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit 2 dated August 19, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values calculated in WCAP&hyph;14046, for Beginning of Cycle (BOC) 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 Probability Of Detection
(POD) were used to develop a cycle average burst probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6
for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD
on core damage frequency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E&hyph;5 per reactor year with a total contribution
from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E&hyph;8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate
repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution
by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the
calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance
of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability
during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The
EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications.
The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one
volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD
of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To further address SG tube burst probability, the following qualitative discussion of limited tube support plate
(TSP) displacement is provided. As part of ComEd's technical support for the implementation of IPC at Braidwood Unit
1, numerous quantitative analyses were completed to assure the structural integrity of the SG tubing. These quantitative
determinations were provided as part of WCAP&hyph;14046. These analyses focused on the quantifiable elements of
the IPC to evaluate the impact of crack length on steam generator tube leakage and burst, and were completed consistent
with the guidance provided in draft RG 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded SG Tubes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bases for these calculations are the analyses completed by the utility industry and reported to the NRC in the EPRI
Draft Report TR&hyph;100407, ``PWR Steam Generator Tube Repair Limits_Technical Support Document for Outside
Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at Tube Support Plates'', Revision 1, August 1993. As explained in this document,
the analyses have been completed to assure that the general design criteria and the requirements of RG 1.121 are met
during plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preparation of these industry documents and the Braidwood Unit 1 specific WCAP&hyph;14046, all analyses for
leakage and burst potential were completed using the extremely conservative assumption that all Outside Diameter
Stress Corrosion Cracking (ODSCC) indications occur on the tubing freespan. In fact, as indicated in both WCAP&hyph;14046
and EPRI Draft Report TR&hyph;100407, ODSCC degradation is confined to the region of the tube/TSP intersection.
The burst capability of a section of tube containing ODSCC indications and located within the tube/TSP intersection
substantially exceeds the burst capability of a freespan tube section without ODSCC indications. Therefore, tubing
left in service by Braidwood's Unit 1 IPC amendment will not burst when confined by the tube support plates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, it is highly unlikely that a section of tubing within the tube support plate will leak, even with through wall
cracks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure structural integrity of the tubing, even during a MSLB accident, ComEd undertook extensive analyses, presented
as part of WCAP&hyph;14046, to show analytically that the TSP's do not move far enough during a MSLB to allow degraded
tubes to uncover, and subsequently, result in increased leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion Analysis is also being conducted and should be submitted
to the NRC by the end of August, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis is being performed using the following assumptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The TSP crevices are clean,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The TSPs are free to move, depending on applied loads, along the length of the SG tube, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Movement of the TSPs along the length of the tube is not restricted by bending or distortion of the SG tube hole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of these base assumptions is extremely conservative in its own right:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. For assumption 1, visual inspections of the secondary side of the tube bundles of Braidwood Unit 1 SGs show some quality
of deposits in the tube to TSP crevice, and along the length of the tube. Since these deposits are considered to be a possible
factor in causing ODSCC, it is likely that any tube having ODSCC indications has deposits in the tube/TSP intersection.
These deposits would tend to close the tube to TSP crevice, restricting by friction the ability of the TSP to move along
the tubes as loads are applied to the TSP during a MSLB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. With regards to assumptions 2 and 3, the TSPs tend to flex and in some locations, are constrained by tie-rods and wedges
attached to the tube bundle shroud. These constraints tend to cause the TSPs to ripple under the applied loads as indicated
in WCAP&hyph;14046. This effect tends to distort the shape of the tube holes, which are fitted to a tight tolerance
around the tubes. Therefore, any distortion of these tube holes caused by motion of the TSP will tend to cause the TSP
to bind against the outside diameter of the tube, further constraining its movement away from the degraded area of
the tubing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of these facts will lessen the ability of the TSP to move, thereby significantly reducing the possibility
that a degraded section of tubing would become uncovered during a MSLB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, this proposed license amendment request does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated within the Braidwood Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of this proposed change does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Removal of
the Amendment 50 and SER operating limits for Unit 1 does not provide a mechanism which could result in a new or different
kind of accident. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a SG in which the IPC has been applied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ComEd has implemented a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per day (gpd) through any one SG to help preclude the
potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational
leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free
span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit will provide for leakage
detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that
is associated with the longest permissible free span crack length. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation
due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during MSLB conditions,
the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at MSLB conditions. Thus, the 105 gpd limit
provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical crack lengths for MSLB conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained upon approval of this amendment request through inservice inspection
and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

&cir;F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of MSLB leakage predicted in Braidwood
Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic method of draft NUREG 1477,
with the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 &mu;Ci/gm to 0.35 &mu;Ci/gm. However,
WCAP 14046, docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal, has shown using
the EPRI Leakrate Correlation that projected EOC&hyph;5 MSLB leakage is 3.1 gpm which is less than the allowable limit
of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP&hyph;14046. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus the Unit 1 operating limit imposed by Amendment 50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 100 day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report
(SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit
derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle
operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging
criteria applied at Braidwood 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights
from the draft Braidwood IPE. Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June 30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was
docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical. While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final

impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit
2 dated August 19, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values calculated in WCAP&hyph;14046, for BOC 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 POD were used to develop a cycle average burst
probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6 for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications
greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD on core damage frequency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E&hyph;5 per reactor year with a total contribution
from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E&hyph;8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate
repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution
by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the
calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance
of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability
during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The
EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications.
The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one
volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD
of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

ODSCC degradation is confined to the region of the tube/TSP intersection. The burst capability of a section of tube

A Generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion Analysis is also being conducted and should be submitted

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis is being performed using the following assumptions:

1. The TSP crevices are clean,

This evidence, in conjunction with the probability of occurrence of a MSLB, and the probabilistic assessment of the

less severe than those assessed in WCAP&hyph;14046 and the generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion
Analyses.

The NRC staff has reviewed the pertinent portions of the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears
that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. This staff finding is partially based on the licensee's
usage of a constant value for the Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.6 as recommended in draft NUREG&hyph;1447. This
is consistent with the staff's position in the Safety Evaluation (SE) it issued in support of Amendment No. 50 to the
Braidwood, Unit 1, operating license. While the licensee also discussed in its analysis the usage of a higher value
for the POD, the staff did not rely on this. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request
involves no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the

who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

Introduction and Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 3(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (RTC Completion Act), Public Law No. 93&hyph;204,
enacted on December 17, 1993, added a new subparagraph (C) to &sect;21A(b)(4) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12
U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4), which requires the RTC to implement and maintain a program, in a manner acceptable to the Thrift
Depositor Protection Oversight Board (Oversight Board), to provide an appeals process for business and commercial
borrowers to appeal decisions by the RTC, when acting as conservator of an insured depository institution, which
would have the effect of terminating or otherwise adversely affecting credit or loan agreements, lines of credit,
and similar arrangements with such borrowers who have not defaulted on their obligations to the institution in conservatorship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC submitted this Policy on Procedures for Non-defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions
of the RTC Acting as Conservator to the Oversight Board for consideration at its June 16, 1994 meeting. The Oversight
Board adopted a resolution approving the policy at that meeting. In that resolution the Oversight Board suggested
that the RTC make the public aware of the new policy through publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC is rapidly resolving the remaining institutions it operates in conservatorships. Inasmuch as the policy
affects only the operation of those institutions in conservatorship, there is a critical need to make the public aware
of this new policy quickly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the request of the Oversight Board and the need to publicize the policy quickly, the RTC has concluded that
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be the best means of disseminating the new policy to members of the public with an interest in the subject matter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Policy on Procedures for Non-Defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions of the RTC Acting
as Conservator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RTC is issuing procedures which provide a process for non-defaulting business and commercial borrowers to appeal
the RTC's decisions (when acting as a conservator) which terminate or otherwise adversely affect credit or loan agreements,
lines of credit or other similar arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appeals process outlined herein pertains to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting commercial
borrower made by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution for which the RTC was acting as conservator
on or after December 17, 1993. These procedures shall only apply to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting
commercial borrower made on or after December 17, 1993 by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution
and only during the period for which the RTC acts as conservator for such insured depository institution. The appeals
process is not intended to deny borrowers any rights otherwise provided under law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appeals process described in this policy does not limit or affect the exercise by the RTC, as conservator or receiver,
of its authority to repudiate contracts pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &sect;1821(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, a predecessor institution retains the obligation to fund unfunded or partially funded loan commitments,
and such obligations are not transferred to or assumed by the new savings association which the RTC operates in conservatorship.
However, it has also been the RTC's policy for the conservator to consider funding partially funded loan commitments,
as generally outlined in the Asset Management and Disposition Manual, Circular 10100.1, Change-One, Section F(3),
and as further detailed with respect to the handling of construction loans in Circular 10100.32, Subject: ``Funding
of ADC Loan Commitments,'' which can be obtained upon request to one of the above listed contacts or from one of the public
reading rooms of the RTC. These practices will continue. Pursuant to Section 21A(b)(4)(C) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as added by Section 3(b) of the RTC Completion Act, effective December 17, 1993, whenever the RTC acting as
conservator decides to deny an extension of credit to a non-defaulting commercial borrower, the borrower shall have
an opportunity to appeal the decision to the next level of authority above the initial decision maker, as described
below.

(1) The Senior Credit Review Committee of the field office with jurisdiction over the conservatorship shall normally
decide the appeal of the non-defaulting commercial borrower. However, if the adverse credit decision under appeal
was made by a field office's Senior Review Committee, or by a person or entity at a level of authority above the field
office Senior Credit Review Committee, then the person or entity at the next level of authority above the initial decision
maker, as determined by the RTC's delegations of authority, shall decide the appeal of the non-defaulting borrower.
(The person or entity deciding the appeal is hereafter referred to as the ``hearer of the appeal.'')
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must file an appeal, in writing, with the hearer of the appeal within 60 calendar
days of receipt of the notice described in subparagraph IV.B above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must state the grounds for the appeal. The non-defaulting commercial borrower
may submit only documentary evidence in support of the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The hearer of the appeal shall make a good faith effort to decide the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of
the appeal and all documentation necessary to act on the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) (a) The record of an appeal shall consist of the written appeal and documentary evidence submitted by the non-defaulting
commercial borrower and any other evidence and information within the possession or control of the RTC that relates
to the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have the right to review any documentation submitted by such borrower,
along with the appeal or prior to the filing of the appeal, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the RTC's records.
The hearer of the appeal may extend the period for deciding the appeal of such reasonable time as may be necessary to
permit any such review of the documentation submitted by the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The hearer of the appeal may reverse an adverse credit decision if the hearer determines that (a) the extension
of credit is likely to reduce a conservatorship's overall losses, or (b) the extension of credit would not be likely
to increase the conservatorship's overall losses.

(7) As a condition to reversing the adverse credit decision, the hearer of the appeal may require the non-defaulting
commercial borrower to release any related claim against the receiver for a predecessor institution, in whole or
in part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The hearer of the appeal shall provide written notice of the decision, including an explanation of any negative
ruling, to the relevant Managing Agent, Field Office Claims Department, and to the non-defaulting commercial borrower.

D. Appeal Log
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A log should be maintained in each conservatorship to track each appeal under this procedure. Entries in the log, to
be initiated upon receipt of the borrower's appeal, shall include the following items: borrower's name, date of credit
application, date of adverse credit decision, decision by whom, date borrower's appeal received, hearer the of appeal,
date of hearer's decision, date borrower notified of decision, and remarks.

E. Appointment of Receiver
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the appointment of a receiver for the depository institution operated in conservatorship by the RTC, with respect
to such institution, the right of all non-defaulting commercial borrowers to appeal (and any pending appeal) under
this process terminates. Thereafter, any rights of the non-defaulting commercial borrowers, with respect to such
depository institution, are governed by 12 U.S.C. &sect;1821(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. No Further Appeal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have no right to appeal the decision of the hearer of the appeal within
the RTC or to any court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. No Effect on RTC's Rights as Receiver or Conservator
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to waive or alter the rights of the RTC as conservator or receiver
with respect to any commercial borrower or any insured depository institution. Such rights include, by way of illustration
only, the rights to repudiate contracts, to leave obligations and liabilities with the receiver of the predecessor
institution and to require non-defaulting commercial borrowers to adhere to the receivership claims procedures
of the RTC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of an appeal with the hearer of the appeal in accordance with the appeal procedures outlined in subparagraph
IV.C above does not preserve, and does not substitute for, the requirement that a claim be filed and the claims process
be pursued with respect to any claim against: (1) the receiver for any predecessor institution, or (2) the receiver
for the depository institution operated in conservatorship if a receiver is appointed for such institution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective [date], the Office of Thrift Supervision appointed the Resolution Trust Corporation as Receiver for [Predecessor
Institution]. Concurrently with such appointment, a new federal mutual association was formed, [name of de novo
institution], and the Resolution Trust Corporation was appointed Conservator of the [name of de novo institution]
(the ``Conservator''). Most of the assets of [Predecessor Institution] were acquired by the Conservator in consideration
of the assumption by the Conservator of some, but not all, of the liabilities of the [Predecessor Institution]. The
Conservator DID NOT, however, assume the obligation to continue to fund your loan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
{
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, and as you were informed in another letter the Receiver for [Predecessor Institution] has repudiated the loan agreement
and terminated any obligation to continue to fund your loan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
}
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 You may have a claim against the Receiver of [Predecessor Institution] for the unfunded loan amount. You must follow
any instructions from the receiver regarding the filing of such claim.

Notwithstanding that the Conservator has no obligation to continue to fund your loan, the Conservator has the discretion
to provide funds to you through a new extension of credit, when the Conservator determines, in its sole discretion,
that it is in the best interest of the Conservator to provide those funds. However, the Conservator has decided not
to provide funds to you.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because you are a non-defaulting commercial borrower of [name of the predecessor institution], section 21A(b)(4)(C)
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act provides you with an opportunity to appeal this adverse credit decision of the Conservator.
You must submit your appeal in writing to the hearer of the appeal, set forth below, within 60 days of receipt of this
notice, stating the grounds for your appeal. In support of your appeal, you may submit documentary evidence, which
must be submitted at the same time as your letter of appeal. The hearer of the appeal will conduct no evidentiary hearing.
A copy of the RTC's policy on borrower appeals is attached for your information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You should know that the hearer of the appeal may only reverse the adverse credit decision if the hearer determines
that to do so would reduce, or would not increase, the overall losses to the RTC as Conservator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will allow Amex to implement a program, in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(``NYSE'') and the National Securities Clearing Corportion (``NSCC''), to compare all Amex equity trades on trade
date. Amex will phase-in the program commencing June 30, 1994, with full implementation scheduled for June 30, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filings with the Commission, Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule changes and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1988, Amex has sought to improve its clearing operations and to reduce exposure to loss through market volatility
by reducing the comparison cycle in stocks and in options. The Amex has reduced the comparison times first from five
business days to three business days and then to one business day after the trade date. For the past five years, the Amex,
in conjunction with the NYSE, has been working with the member firm community and the NSCC to establish operational
parameters, systems, and rules for shortening trade comparison time frames. In 1989, the Amex adopted Rule 719, which
requires next-day comparison (``T+1'') of exchange transactions, and developed its Intra-Day Comparison (``IDC'')
System, which is an electronic system designed to match trade sides and to resolve uncompared trades known as ``don't
knows'' or ``DKs.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The IDC System is used by Amex for both equities and options.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27851 (March 27, 1990), 55 FR 12759 [File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;89&hyph;05]
(order approving proposed rule change).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex now proposes to implement, again in conjunction with NYSE and NSCC, trade-date comparison of Amex equity
transactions. Trade-date comparison will be implemented in phases with a final target date of June 30, 1995. The first
phase of this program is scheduled to be implemented by the end of June 1994. When the first phase has been implemented,
the Amex will require all member firms to input equity trade data into the IDC System every two hours on the date of the
trade rather than once daily. Input times will be 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Amex member firms already
are submitting option trade data into the IDC System on trade-date on an hourly basis. The IDC System will continue
to be the main processor of the comparison data. The Amex will transmit the compared trades to a registered clearing
agency in order to complete the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex is not proposing any written changes to its rules at this time. Amex Rule 719(a), which currently requires
each transaction effected on the Amex to be compared or closed out no later than close-of-business on T+1, will remain
in effect for the present time. The Amex believes that its Rule 719(c), which requires members to submit trade data
as may be required by the Amex, provides it with sufficient authority to require clearing members to submit trade data
in listed stocks and options for comparison by such times as Amex may prescribe. However, as the final implementation
date of June 30, 1995, approaches, Amex will file any other rule changes with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)
of the Act
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 as are necessary or appropraite to implement the trade-date comparison program. As indicated above, any such Amex
rule changes will be developed in conjunction with the NYSE and NSCC, and Amex will work with the NYSE and NSCC to achieve
uniformity and to monitor the implementation of each phase of this program.

The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (as long
as five business days for equity transactions until 1990) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October
1987. The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade
processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during
the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts
to compare all trades on trade date.

Since 1988, the Amex, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated
with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The Amex reduced its comparison
cycle in stocks first from T+5 to T+3 and then to T+1 in 1990.

As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change which shortens the Amex comparison cycle from
T+1 to trade date will make Amex's comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility
and more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in post-trade processing. The Commission believes that
the proposal will offer additional protection to investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors'
funds and facilitate investors' transactions. In the Commission's view, this proposal will provide fundamental
and important improvements to the marketplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filings in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Trade-date comparison is to be phased-in by both Amex and NYSE on a parallel schedule, and the NYSE has begun some aspects
of its phase-in program.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Accelerated approval of this proposal will permit Amex, as well as the NYSE and NSCC, to provide their clearing members
with a more coordinated implementation of trade-date comparison. Furthermore, because neither the Commission
nor NYSE received any written comments on the NYSE's proposal, which was very similar to the Amex's proposal, and because
the Amex did not receive any comments from its members in response to its Information Circular,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission does not expect to receive any comments on this proposal. Therefore, the Commission believes there
is good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice
of the filing.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on June 22, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association''),
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The PORTAL Market is the market operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., for the quotation of securities that are
restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or are
securities that are treated as if restricted.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In order to qualify for inclusion in The PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must
be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, 
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification
number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class.

Part II, PORTAL Rules, provides that to qualify for initial designation and continued designation in the PORTAL Market,
a security shall be either a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, or a security
that upon issuance and continually thereafter only can be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act,
Rule 114A, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 of the Securities Act and not involving any public offering.

This provision requires that the security meet the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) and (4) under the Securities Act,
which are, respectively, the ``fungibility'' and ``information delivery requirement'' conditions of Rule 114A.

The PORTAL Market has processed over one thousand applications for designation as a PORTAL security. Designation
of a security as a PORTAL security permits the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation
and be cleared and settled through the Depository Trust Company. Section 2 of the PORTAL Rules permits any PORTAL participant
to submit an application for security designation, rather than the issuer of the security. ``PORTAL participants''
include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories of PORTAL participants are
required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the Exchange Act and members
of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that are not members of the NASD
that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NASD has operated The PORTAL Market since it initiated operations in June 1990 without the imposition of any fees
on users. The NASD is proposing to adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each
security identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. Many private offerings of securities are of securities
that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which is treated as a separate security, even though part of a single private
offering, and assigned a separate identification symbol by The PORTAL Market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing
costs associated with the operation of the PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing
of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review
of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that
the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of the PORTAL Rules, as set forth above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications are generally submitted the day prior to commencing the private placement or the day prior to conducting
a ``road show,'' if such a road show is used, and approval is necessary within one or two days at the most.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, because of a continuing lack of knowledge regarding the procedures for obtaining approval for PORTAL
designation, Depository Trust Company book-entry approval, and the issuance of a CUSIP number from Standard &amp;
Poor's, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff must work closely with the applicant to complete the process. Further,
private offerings that rely on Rule 144A for redistribution of the securities to qualified institutional buyers
are many times unique in their structure, as well as frequently involving issues related to SEC Regulation S and compliance
with the CUSIP identification number requirement when an offshore offering occurs simultaneously with a U.S. private
placement. Finally, there are many issues with multiple tranches, each of which must be assigned a separate security
symbol. Given the efforts required by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD belies that the fees as proposed
are appropriate.

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Exchange
Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates
or controls in that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications submitted by PORTAL
dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in The PORTAL Market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Connecticut Light and Power Company (``CL&amp;P''), Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, an electric public-utility
subsidiary company of Northwest Utilities, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment
under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6(a)
and 5 of the Act and rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated December 16, 1986 (HCAR No. 24263), the Commission authorized CL&amp;P, among other things, to issue
a promissory note up to an aggregate principal amount of $25 million to the Industrial Development Authority of the
State of New Hampshire (``IDA''). The note evidenced IDA's loan to CL&amp;P of the proceeds from pollution control
revenue bonds (``Bonds'') issued by IDA to finance the cost of acquiring, constructing and installing certain pollution
control facilities and/or sewage or solid waste disposal facilities at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, Unit
No. 1 in Seabrook, New Hampshire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to improve the credit ratings of the Bonds, CL&amp;P obtained a letter of credit (``LOC'') from the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Limited (``Credit Bank''). Subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds, Credit Bank's rating in the
financial markets deteriorated. CL&amp;P has been informed that many institutional investors that otherwise would
be interested in purchasing the bonds will not purchase securities secured by letters of credit issued by the Credit
Bank, and investors that are still willing to purchase the Bonds are demanding an interest rate premium that is causing
CL&amp;P's effective interest cost to be higher than it would have otherwise been using a bank with a higher rating.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&amp;P now seeks authority to: (1) replace Credit Bank LOC and the Bank Reimbursement Agreement with a new Letter
of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (``Substitute Agreement''); (2) replace the LOC with a new letter of Credit
(``New LOC''); and subsequently thereto (3) extend, modify, or replace the Substitute Agreement and the New LOC from
time to time during the term of the bonds supported thereby. The terms of any such extensions, modifications or replacements,
including the New LOC and the Substitute Agreement, shall provide that (a) the total amount available to be drawn under
any such extended, modified or replacement letter of credit does not exceed $16.2 million, representing principal
in the amount of $15.4 million and interest in the amount of $800,000 calculated at the maximum rate of 15% for 123 days,
(b) the annual letter of credit costs applicable to any such extension, modification, or replacement do not exceed
1% per annum of the total amount available to be drawn under the extended, modified or replacement letter of credit,
and (c) the reimbursement agreement applicable to any such extension, modification or replacement shall provide
(or shall afford CL&amp;P the option to elect) that tender advances tear interest until paid at a rate not to exceed
the higher of the prime rate plus 2% or the federal funds rate plus 2%, (d) such extension, modification or replacement
is otherwise on terms that are substantially similar in all material respects to those applicable to the New LOC and
Substitute Agreement (or previous extensions or modifications thereof or replacements therefore proposed to be
entered into in connection with the replacement of Credit Bank, and (e) CL&amp;P shall have obtained all necessary
State Commission approvals applicable to such extension, modification or replacement.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70&hyph;8167)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, a registered
holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder to its
declaration previously filed under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) (``April Order''), the Commission authorized CNG to issue and sell on
or before June 30, 1995 up to $400 million principal amount of debentures (``Debentures'') in one or more series at
a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which would be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and
at an interest rate which would be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Debentures would mature in not more than
thirty years and would be issued in accordance with the indenture between CNG and Chemical Bank (successor by merger
to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee, dated May 1, 1971 (``Indenture''). CNG has sold $300 million
of Debentures under the April Order, thus $100 million of Debentures remains authorized for issue and sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG now proposes to change its Indenture by adding section 4.02 so that it may reserve the right, without the consent
of the holders of future debenture issues sold under the April Order, to amend sections 6.06 and 6.07 of the Indenture.
New section 4.02 provides:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate corporate action, but without consent, approval or other
action by holders of debentures of any series created after May 1, 1994, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as
heretofore supplemented and amended, as shall be necessary in order to amend Sections 6.06 and 6.07 thereof so as to
modify or eliminate the provisions or requirements of such Sections, or any part thereof and the definition of any
term used in either of such Sections or related thereto, as the Company may determine in its sole discretion.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6.06 provides that funded debt (as defined) cannot be incurred and subsidiary preferred stock cannot be issued
unless: (1) The consolidated income available for interest and subsidiary preferred stock dividends of CNG and its
subsidiaries for any 12 consecutive months within 15 months immediately preceding the date additional funded debt
is incurred is not less than 21/2 times the sum of the total annual interest charges and the total subsidiary preferred
stock dividends, assuming the incurrence of such additional funded debt or issuance of such preferred stock, as the
case may be; and (2) after giving effect to the incurring of the additional funded debt and issuance of preferred stock,
the sum of the outstanding consolidated debt of CNG and its subsidiaries and the amount of outstanding subsidiary
preferred stock shall not be more than 60% of the consolidated net tangible assets of CNG and its subsidiaries. Section
6.07 provides that a subsidiary of CNG cannot incur funded debt or issue preferred stock to a third party unless funded
debt and preferred stock of the subsidiary will not exceed 60% of the total capitalization of the subsidiary, and the
principal amount of funded debt and amount of preferred stock of all subsidiaries of CNG shall not exceed 15% of consolidated
net tangible assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG also requests authorization to extend the expiration date for the issuance and sale of the remaining $100 million
principal amount of Debentures under the April Order from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 1996.

Inc. (``Ohio''), Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., and Commonwealth Gas Services,

``Applicants''), have filed a post-effective amendment to their application-declaration under Sections 6(a),
7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 12(f) of the Act and Rules 43 and 45 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated September 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25896) (``September Order''), the Commission authorized Applicants,
among other things, to engage in financing from September 30, 1993 through December 31, 1994 of up to $629.9 million.
At that time, the Commission authorized Ohio to engage in long-term financing of up to $73.1 million and short-term
financing of up to $162 million, and authorized Columbia to provide $398.7 million in short-term financing to its
subsidiaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Columbia now proposes to increase the amount of short-term financing for Ohio $40 million. These short-term borrowings
will have the same terms and conditions as those authorized by the September Order. Thus, Ohio proposes to borrow the
funds directly from Columbia and/or from certain other subsidiaries of Columbia through Columbia's intrasystem
money pool (``Money Pool''), and Columbia requests authority to loan to its subsidiaries an additional $40 million
for short-term borrowings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Money Pool provides a vehicle by which Columbia and its subsidiary companies loan their excess cash to their associate
companies. Funds would be advanced, repaid, and reborrowed as required through December 31, 1994, with all such advances
to be fully repaid by April 30, 1995. All short-term borrowings from Columbia and/or the Money Pool will be evidenced
by a promissory note (``Short-Term Note'' and ``Money Pool Note'', respectively). A default rate of 2% per annum above
the pre-default rate on unpaid principal or interest amounts will be assessed if any interest or principal payment
becomes past due.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interest rate charged on all Short-Term Notes and Money Pool Notes, and the investment rate earned on moneys invested
in the Money Pool, will be the interest rate per annum equal to the composite weighted average effective rate on short-term
transactions of Columbia and/or the Money Pool short-term investment rate. During any month, this composite rate
may be based on one or any combination of: (1) The cost of Columbia's borrowings under its bank facility; (2) the interest
rate earned by Columbia on invested excess cash; and/or (3) the interest rate earned by subsidiaries on investments
of excess Money Pool funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Southern Company (``Southern''), 64 Perimeter Center East, Atlanta, Georgia 30346, a registered holding company,
has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5)
thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes to acquire the securities of one or more companies (``Project Parents'') engaged directly or indirectly,
and exclusively, in the business of owning and holding the securities of ``foreign utility companies'' (``FUCOs''),
as defined in Section 33(a) of the Act, and ``exempt wholesale generators'' (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32(a)
of the Act. Southern requests that the authorization for its proposals remain effective until the earlier of: (i)
December 31, 1996; and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission that
would exempt the acquisition of any securities of any Project Parent from the requirements of Sections 9(a) and 10
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that a Project Parent may be organized at the time of, and in order to facilitate: the making of bids
or proposals to acquire an interest in any EWG or FUCO (``Exempt Subsidiaries''); after the award of a bid proposal,
in order to facilitate closing on the purchase or financing of any such Exempt Subsidiary; or at any time subsequent
to the consummation of an acquisition of an interest in an Exempt Subsidiary. A Project Parent would be formed after
the acquisition of an Exempt Subsidiary in order to: effect an adjustment in the respective ownership interests in
any Exempt Subsidiary held by Southern and unaffiliated co-investors; facilitate a partial sale of an interest in
any such Exempt Subsidiary; comply with applicable laws of foreign jurisdictions limiting or otherwise relating
to the ownership of domestic companies by foreign nationals; or, to limit Southern's exposure to U.S. and foreign
taxes as part of tax planning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern requests authority to make direct or indirect investments in Project Parents in an aggregate amount at any
one time outstanding not to exceed $400 million. Any such direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project
Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof, and giving effect thereto, Southern's ``aggregate investment,''
determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of Southern's
``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule 53(a)(1)(ii). In addition, any such investment in any particular
Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection with making
the underlying investment in any Exempt Subsidiary (or Exempt Subsidiaries) with respect to which such Project Parent
was organized or formed, taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs, and cash reserves
required to be maintained in accordance with financing documents. Southern states that it will also comply with all
other applicable rules under the Act, including, without limitation, such rules as may be promulgated in the future
pursuant to Sections 32 and 33.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that investments by Southern in any Project Parents may take the form of any combination of the following:
(i) Ppurchases of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing
under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable; (ii) cash capital contributions or open account advances;
(iii) loans evidenced by promissory notes; and (iv) guaranties by Southern of the principal of or interest on any promissory
notes or other evidences of indebtedness of any Project Parent issued to lenders other than Southern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes that any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have
a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value, and that any open account advance made
by Southern to a Project Parent be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the date of the advance. Southern
also proposes that any promissory note issued by a Project Parent to Southern, and any promissory note or similar evidence
of indebtedness with respect to which Southern may issue a guaranty, would mature not later than 30 years after the
date of insurance, and would bear interest at a rate: (a) Not greater than the prime rate at a bank to be designated by
Southern in the case of any promissory note issued to Southern, and (b) not greater than 3% over such prime rate in the
case of any note or similar evidence of indebtedness guarantied by Southern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any promissory note issued to Southern by any Project Parent may, at Southern's option, be converted to a capital contribution
to such Project Parent through Southern's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds for any direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project Parent (including the guaranty of any securities
of any Project Parent) will be derived from: (i) The sale of common stock or the issuance of guarantees (within the limitations
of HCAR No. 25980 (January 25, 1994), or in any future authorization obtained from the Commission); (ii) bank borrowings
or commercial paper sales (within the limitations of HCAR No. 26004 (March 15, 1994), or any future authorization
obtained from the Commission); and, (iii) available cash. Southern is not requesting the authority to issue any additional
securities for the purpose of financing investments in any Project Parents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that it is currently investigating potential opportunities to acquire or construct electric generation,
transmission or distribution facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. Southern believes that,
in almost all cases, such facilities will qualify as facilities that a FUCO may own or operate.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Southern states that it has been Southern's experience, in connection with its foreign project development activities
to date, including the preparation and submission of bid proposals in foreign government privatization programs,
that the formation and acquisition of one or more Project Parents (usually, but not always, foreign corporations
or the equivalent thereof) is necessary or desirable to facilitate the acquisition and ownership of a FUCO. For example,
laws of some foreign countries may require that the bidder in a privatization program be a domestic company. In such
cases, it would be necessary for Southern to form a foreign subsidiary as the entity submitting the bid or other proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In some instances, a foreign utility facility may also qualify as an ``eligible facility,'' as defined in Section
32(a)(2) of the Act. Depending upon various facts and circumstances, Southern may in the future pursue any particular
foreign utility investment opportunity as an EWG rather than as a FUCO, in which case the requisite filing or filings
would be made with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern states that there would typically be other business reasons for creating Project Parents. Southern states
that, for example, the interposition of one or more wholly-owned Project Parents may be necessary to minimize U.S.
income taxes (e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable
tax treaties among foreign countries). Further, Project Parents are useful in cases in which Southern may bid as a
part of a consortium of companies, since each member of the consortium will typically want to have at least one consolidated
subsidiary in the final FUCO ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Finally, Project Parents serve
to isolate business risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among or by the members of
the ownership group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes herein that a Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests in both FUCOs
and EWGs.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The ability to combine ownership of both FUCOs and EWGs under a single company will enable Southern to minimize the
number of separate intermediate subsidiaries needed in connection with its investments in EWGs and FUCOs.

Southern states that, within 45 days after Southern determines that the purposes for owning any Project Parent no
longer exists, it shall liquidate or dissolve such Project Parent, unless, within that time, Southern determines
that such Project Parent may be used in conjunction with a proposal or plan to acquire an interest in a different Exempt
Subsidiary. Southern requests authority to liquidate or dissolve any Project Parent under such circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern also requests approval for any Project Parent to issue equity securities and debt securities to persons
other than Southern (and with respect to which there is no recourse to Southern), including banks, insurance companies,
and other financial institutions, exclusively for the purpose of financing (including any refinancing of) investments
in Exempt Subsidiaries. Such securities may be issued in one or more transactions from time to time through the earlier
to occur of (i) December 31, 1996, and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission
exempting such transaction from the application requirements under the Act. It is proposed that the aggregate principal
amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project Parents to persons other than Southern will not exceed $800
million at any one time outstanding. No more than $200 million principal amount of such non-recourse debt securities
at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In any case in which Southern directly
or indirectly owns less than all of the equity interests of a Project Parent, only that portion of the non-recourse
indebtedness of such Project Parent equal to Southern's equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes
of the foregoing limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to any party other than Southern may include capital shares, partnership
interests, trust certificiates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable foreign law. Non-recourse
debt securities issued to parties other than Southern may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated
notes, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either
U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that the amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including interest rate, maturity,
prepayment or redemption privileges, and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would
be negotiated on a case by case basis, taking into account differences from project to project in optimum debt-equity
ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives, and other similar financial and performance
characteristics of each project. Accordingly, Southern requests the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions
of such securities without further approval by the Commission.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Southern states that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued
or sold by a Project Parent for a consideration that is less than such par value. Southern also states that no note, bond
or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature later than 30 years from the date
of issuance thereof, and will bear interest at a rate exceeding the following: (i) if such note, bond or other indebtedness
is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the yield to maturity on an actively traded, non-callable,
U.S. Treasury note having a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other indebtedness (``Applicable
Treasury Rate''),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the then applicable prime rate at a U.S. money center bank to be designated
by Southern (``Applicable Prime Rate''); and (ii) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency
of a country other than the United States, at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing
rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country, would be equivalent
to a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable
Treasury Rate or Applicable Prime Rate, as the case may be.

If there is no actively traded U.S. Treasury note with a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other
evidence of indebtedness, then the Applicable Treasury Rate would be determined by interpolating linearly with
reference to the yields to maturity on actively traded, non-callable, Treasury notes having maturities near (i.e.,
both shorter and longer than) such average life.

In connection with the issuance of any non-recourse debt securities by any Project Parent, it is anticipated that
such Project Parent may grant security in its assets. Such security interest may take the form of a pledge of the shares
or other equity securities of an Exempt Subsidiary that it owns, including a security interest in any distributions
from any such Exempt Subsidiary, or a collateral assignment of its rights under and interests in other property, including
rights under contracts. It is also anticipated that fees in the form of placement or commitment fees, or other similar
fees, would be paid to lenders, placement agents, or others in connection with the issuance of any such non-recourse
debt securities. Southern requests authority for any Project Parent to agree in any case to pay placement or commitment
fees, and other similar fees, in connection with any borrowing, provided that the effective annual interest charge
on any indebtedness evidencing such borrowing is not greater than 115% of the stated interest rate thereon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with investments in Exempt Subsidiaries, Southern states that it is typical that a portion of the capital
requirements of any such Exempt Subsidiary would be obtained through non-recourse financing involving borrowings
from banks and other financial institutions. Southern also states that, in some cases, however, it may be necessary
or desirable to structure an investment in an Exempt Subsidiary such that the obligations created are not those of
the Exempt Subsidiary, but instead those of its parent companies. For example, in a consortium of non-affiliated
companies bidding to purchase the securities or assets of an EWG or FUCO, each of the consortium members would be obligated
to fund its respective share of the proposed purchase price. If external sources of funds are needed for this purpose,
a participant in the consortium may choose to engage in non-recourse financing through one or more single-purpose
subsidiaries that would then utilize the proceeds of the financing to acquire an ownership interest in the Exempt
Subsidiary.

 This FHWA policy statement on life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) helps fulfill Federal management responsibilities
for analyzing life-cycle cost aspects of infrastructure investment decisions under Executive Order 12893, ``Principles
of Federal Infrastructure Investment.'' The policy statement establishes LCCA principles to be applied by FHWA
in infrastructure investment analyses, and in evaluating the adequacy of State highway agency procedures used in
conducting required LCCA for investments funded through the Federal-aid highway program. States and local agencies
are expected to apply these principles in evaluating program and project level investment decisions involving Federal-aid
highway funds as required under applicable FHWA regulations. Comments are solicited on potential problems in implementing
provisions of this policy statement and specific needs for training and technical assistance in LCCA.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is an increasing recognition that total life-cycle costs of highway and transportation investments must be
given greater consideration in all phases of highway programs. Executive Order 12893, ``Principles of Federal Infrastructure
Investment,'' requires that benefits and costs of infrastructure investment be measured and appropriately discounted
over the full life cycle of each project. Sections 1024 and 1025 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1977) also require consideration of ``the use of life-cycle
cost in the design and engineering of bridges, tunnels, or pavement.'' Subpart B of the interim final rule on implementation
of ISTEA management systems (23 CFR 500.207) requires use of LCCA for pavement management systems (PMS) and Subpart
C (23 CFR 500.307) requires use of LCCA or comparable techniques for bridge management systems (BMS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life-cycle cost analysis is an economic evaluation of all current and future costs associated with investment alternatives.
It is a valuable economic analysis technique for evaluating highway and other transportation programs and projects
that require long-term capital and maintenance expenditures over the extended lives of facilities. Future costs
are discounted using an appropriate discount rate to compare costs incurred at different points in time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life-cycle cost analysis principles and techniques are used in many types of economic analysis to compare benefits
and costs arising at different points in time. Benefit-cost analysis and cost effectiveness analysis, for instance,
use life-cycle cost analysis principles to discount future benefits and costs of investment alternatives over the
lives of alternatives being evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life-cycle cost analysis is used to evaluate programs of pavement and bridge improvements as well as individual projects.
It is an important input to estimates of future funding requirements and to the development of improvement programs,
especially when there are budget constraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of value engineering is receiving increased attention as a technique for analyzing the functions of a program,
project, system, product, or service to identify opportunities to significantly lower costs while still achieving
the essential functions. Life-cycle costs are often analyzed to ensure that unnecessary costs are avoided by considering
future operations, maintenance, and reconstruction requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Total life-cycle costs of specific facilities may be many times the initial construction costs when user costs are
considered. It is essential that a long term perspective be taken in programming improvements, selecting among alternative
maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction strategies, and designing pavements, structures, and other
highway elements. Longer design lives may have to be considered, and traditional strategies for programming maintenance
and rehabilitation activities may have to be reevaluated to determine whether they adequately consider future costs,
including user delay-related costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing congestion on important highways in urban areas and some rural areas makes it critical to fully consider
life-cycle costs of investment decisions. Safety concerns and auxiliary construction costs to maintain, rehabilitate,
or reconstruct congested highways and bridges under traffic are very high. User costs and delays around work zones
in congested areas may be even higher and represent significant inefficiencies that may adversely affect economic
productivity, especially on the National Highway System (NHS). These delays can erode productivity gains realized
by the growing number of industries using just-in-time and other advanced logistics strategies that depend on efficient
and predictable transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of whether user costs are included in a formal LCCA, most States already implicitly consider user costs
when they choose to pay premiums to maintain traffic through work zones or design more durable pavements in congested
urban areas. Including user costs in LCCA makes these implicit considerations explicit, and may help identify other
opportunities to reduce overall agency and user costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognition of the high future costs to maintain and rehabilitate highways, bridges and tunnels, and their associated
traffic control, safety, environmental, and hydraulic components has led to increased interest in the potential
for LCCA to improve investment productivity and reduce public and private costs of highway and other transportation
programs. The FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) jointly
sponsored a symposium in December 1993 to learn more about LCCA practices among the States and to identify research,
training, technical assistance, and policy-related needs to improve LCCA application. An important input to that
symposium was an AASHTO survey of State LCCA practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many specific LCCA issues and research needs were identified at the symposium. Key technical issues included how
to establish the appropriate analysis period, how to value and properly consider user costs, and how to choose the
appropriate discount rate. Participants also identified important research and data needed to predict pavement
and bridge performance and forecast future traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An important policy issue raised at the symposium was the recognition that results of LCCA may favor selection of improvements
with higher initial costs in order to achieve significant long term savings in overall investment requirements.
It may indicate, for instance, that more projects warrant reconstruction rather than rehabilitation strategies,
that early intervention with preventive maintenance is cost effective, or that somewhat higher designs or levels
of service may be appropriate for some facilities. The FHWA recognizes that LCCA, thus, may result in proposals for
greater expenditures up front. At the same time virtually all transportation agencies will continue to face budgetary
limitations at least over the short term. Life-cycle cost analysis will help agencies identify and explain the real
costs borne by transportation users of inadequate infrastructure funding. Furthermore, LCCA can assist agencies
that face fiscal constraints in making the best use of available funds. Several States already use LCCA in developing
network improvement programs as part of their pavement and bridge management systems. Eventually it is desirable
for all States to have such capabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following paragraphs highlight key principles of good LCCA practice. Applying these principles generally will
allow States and local agencies to identify investment alternatives that will minimize total life-cycle costs.
While their use is not mandatory in all instances, States are strongly encouraged to apply these principles in conducting
life-cycle cost analyses unless there are unique characteristics of particular programs or projects that require
principles to be modified. Life-cycle cost analysis, of course, is only one consideration in many investment decisions,
but it certainly is one of the most important for NHS routes and other high volume roads in light of the costs and lost
productivity associated with future maintenance and rehabilitation actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general there are no hard and fast rules concerning the appropriate length of the analysis period. The analysis
period will vary depending on the type of improvement (bridge, versus tunnel, versus pavement), the location (urban
versus rural), the highway system (NHS versus other), and the design lives of all appropriate alternatives. In general,
longer design lives should be considered for improvements on the NHS and other high volume urban roadways because
future agency and user costs associated with maintenance and rehabilitation activities may be so high. For pavement
improvements on the NHS, design lives of 50 years may be reasonable while bridge and tunnel improvements may have design
lives of 100 or more years. The consideration of longer design lives will require longer analysis periods in LCCA.
Analysis periods for projects involving other modes generally should be long enough to cover the full life-expectancy
of the investment_the time until facilities would have to be reconstructed if initially constructed to an optimum
design. These lives would vary according to the modal alternative being examined. Analysis periods for all project
alternatives should be the same length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of user costs in LCCA is particularly controversial among some States. Part of the controversy over
user costs is the fact that they often are many times higher than agency costs and can critically influence decisions.
While all motorists do not value costs of delays as highly as do commercial travelers, the costs and lost productivity
to businesses of delays around work zones are simply too high to ignore. In fact, such delays arguably have a greater
impact on business than delays associated with inadequate capacity because businesses factor normal congestion
costs into their plans, but delays around work zones generally cannot be foreseen and thus are more disruptive. Technical
advisories to be developed on estimating user operating and delay costs will address this issue in greater detail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to increased delay and vehicle operating costs, rehabilitation and maintenance activities may result
in increased accident costs around work zones. Technical advisories will be developed to assist in estimating increases
in accident rates associated with different types of rehabilitation and maintenance activities. The most comprehensive
information on the costs of motor vehicle accidents is contained in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
publication, ``The Economic Cost of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 1990.'' A copy of this document is available in the public
docket for this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proper use of the discount rate has been an issue for LCCA, cost-benefit analysis and other types of economic analysis
as well. Among the issues are the relationship between the discount rate and inflation, factors that affect the choice
of rates, and how to establish rates over a long analysis period. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;94,
``Guidelines and Discount Rate for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' provides guidance on selecting
appropriate discount rates for economic analyses. Since the choice of discount rate can affect relative life-cycle
costs, sensitivity analysis may be appropriate if two or more alternatives are close in cost, if streams of costs and
benefits among alternatives vary significantly over time, or if the discount rate is outside the range of discount
rates recommended by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA will develop training and technical assistance materials to address issues in LCCA. These materials should
supplement guidance on economic analysis techniques contained in AASHTO's 1977 publication, ``A Manual on User
Benefit Analysis of Highway and Bus-Transit Improvements,''

The following is FHWA's LCCA policy for infrastructure investment analyses. It represents good practice that should
be followed by States and local transportation agencies in making program and project investment decisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Life-cycle costs are an important consideration in all highway investment decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The level of detail in LCCA should be commensurate with the level of investment involved and the types of alternatives
being analyzed. Investments on the NHS generally warrant more detailed analysis than investments on non-NHS routes.
Similarly, evaluation of decisions whether to reconstruct or rehabilitate a facility warrants more detailed analysis
than consideration of alternative maintenance strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Typical life-cycle cost analysis profiles may be developed and used as the basis for evaluating alternatives for
general types of improvements, such as, consideration of alternative pavement designs or different types of bridges
on various functional class highways. Major programs and projects, however, often will require consideration of
a broad range of alternative rehabilitation and reconstruction options and more detailed analysis of potential
alternatives. The potential applicability and use of LCCA profiles will be discussed in greater detail in future
technical advisories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Other factors, including budgetary, environmental, and safety considerations, legitimately influence highway
investment decisions and should be considered along with the results of LCCA in evaluating investment alternatives.
Life-cycle cost analysis principles should be used in conjunction with other appropriate economic analysis techniques
in pavement and bridge management systems. Systemwide or network objectives as well as project level concerns should
be considered in decisionmaking, and both levels of analysis should consider life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Analysis periods should be for the life of the facility or system of facilities being evaluated and should account
for costs of foreseeable future actions. Analysis periods should not be less than 75 years for major bridge, tunnel,
or hydraulic system investments, and not less than 35 years for pavement investments. Longer design lives may be appropriate
for the NHS or other major routes or corridors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All appropriate agency costs anticipated during the analysis period should be considered in the analysis, including
traffic control costs during maintenance and rehabilitation, costs of special construction procedures required
to maintain traffic, and agency operating costs for such things as tunnel lighting and ventilation. In those cases
where the agency required to operate a facility is not the one making the investment decision, it is important for the
funding agency to include operating costs borne by other organizations responsible for operating the facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. User costs including increased vehicle operating costs, accident costs, and delay-related costs incurred throughout
the analysis period should be considered in LCCA. Increased costs due to deteriorated riding surfaces, circuitous
routings, and accidents and delays around and through maintenance and construction work zones are all important.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Future agency and user costs should be discounted to net present value or converted to equivalent uniform annual
costs using appropriate discount rates. Discount rates selected should be consistent with guidance provided in
OMB Circular A&hyph;94. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical advisories on these and other technical issues in the application of LCCA will be issued by FHWA in the future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total amount available in fiscal year 1994 for grant awards in the research program area of Solar Ultraviolet Radiation
Monitoring is approximately $800,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program, in addition to providing support for research on biological
response to predicted effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, invited applications in 1991 for development of
instrumentation for a solar ultraviolet radiation monitoring network. Based on the results now available from that
earlier activity, the Department desires to support continued development of high quality spectroradiometers
for measurements of ultraviolet-B radiation and utilization of the spectroradiometers in research to accurately
determine ultraviolet-B radiation at ground level. Such information will more accurately document levels of UV
radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Such knowledge is needed in order to develop an understanding of the response
of living systems to current conditions, to forecast future effects, and to develop response strategies for mitigating
effects resulting from any future increases in UV radiation. The following specific program area and guidelines
are provided as a base from which proposals may be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals developed for the Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Monitoring program should include field instrumentation
for high quality spectral irradiance measurements and a research plan for data collection, analysis, and use. Emphasis
should be placed on the following instrumentation specifications and operating protocols:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The instrument should measure the global horizontal terrestrial solar UV&hyph;B spectral irradiance over the spectral
wavelength region from 280&hyph;400 nm. Overall network radiometric uncertainty should be no more than 10% (3 sigma)
at 295 nm decreasing to less than 5% (3 sigma) at 340 nm. These and following specifications are applicable over the
ambient range of temperature, humidity, and pressure found in northern temperate latitudes.

Finally, instrument calibration and characterization with regard to the criteria specified herein, and standardization
among the several instruments, is considered critical. The research plan should give consideration to data collection,
storage, retrieval, processing, and statistical analysis. It is expected that these data will be handled in a manner
appropriate for use by the U.S. and international scientific communities; for support of atmospheric science research;
model development and validation; and documentation of UV&hyph;B climatology.

I. Purpose and Substantive Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations governing the Rental Certificate and the Rental Voucher Programs are published at 24 CFR parts 882
and 887, respectively. The regulations for allocating housing assistance budget authority under section 213(d)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are published at 24 CFR part 791, subpart D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Housing Needs Formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this fiscal year, approximately $975 million of budget authority for the rental voucher and certificate programs
is available for fair share formula allocation. (This amount may be reduced by up to $100 million (or some other amount)
to increase the level of funding for litigation or desegregation.) This funding will support additional units for
HA rental voucher and rental certificate programs. Of this amount, approximately $624 million is for rental vouchers
and approximately $351 million is for rental certificates. This budget authority is being allocated to HUD State
or Area Office and allocation areas under this NOFA, using the housing needs factors established in accordance with
24 CFR 791.402. For purposes of this NOFA, the Department is using the metropolitan area designations that were in
effect prior to December 31, 1992, since detailed census data tabulations for the new metropolitan area designations
are not available, yet. In addition, $51.3 million is retained in a Headquarters Reserve which will not be allocated
by formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Metropolitan/Non-Metropolitan Mix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Separate housing needs factors were developed for the metropolitan and non-metropolitan allocation areas within
each HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction. On a nationwide basis, approximately 90 percent of the Fiscal Year 1994
``fair share'' budget authority for the Rental Voucher Program and Rental Certificate Program is designated for
metropolitan areas. The metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing assistance budget authority
available for use in metropolitan areas and the non-metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing
assistance budget authority available for use in non-metropolitan areas.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The allocation areas were established by the HUD field offices to ensure sufficient competition among HAs (including
State and regional or multi-county HAs) operating housing programs within the HUD-established allocation areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Program Type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the fair share allocation of housing assistance budget authority (See Attachment 1) for the
Rental Voucher Program and for the Rental Certificate Program to each HUD State or Area Office for designated allocation
areas, based on the housing needs factors. The allocation of housing assistance budget authority to each allocation
area, however, is the total for both programs. The allocations have been structured to give HUD State or Area Offices
flexibility in approving HA applications for the rental voucher program or the rental certificate program. It is
not necessary that each allocation area within a HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction be provided both rental vouchers
and rental certificates. This notice also provides, for each allocation area, an estimate of the total number of rental
vouchers and rental certificates that could be funded from the housing assistance available in the allocation area.
These estimates are based on the average fair market rents for two-bedroom units in the HUD State or Area Office's jurisdiction.
The actual number of units assisted will vary from these estimates in the actual bedroom size mix that is funded in a
given area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Potential Additional Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If additional rental voucher or rental certificate funding becomes available for incremental use during Fiscal
Year 1994, the Department plans to distribute any additional funding to HUD State or Area Offices using the same percentage
distribution as reflected in Attachment 1 to this NOFA. Any additional funding will be used under the competitive
requirements of this NOFA to fund HA applications which were approvable but not funded, or approved and funded at less
than 100 percent of the requested amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Family Self-Sufficiency Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless specifically exempted by HUD, any rental voucher or rental certificate funding reserved in FY 94 (except funding
for renewals or amendments) will be used to establish the minimum size of a PHA's FSS program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. HA Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Selection Criteria/Rating Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Selection Criterion 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HA Administrative Capability (40 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Overall HA administrative capability in the Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs
is either excellent or good. Administrative Capability is evidenced by factors such as leasing rates and correct
administration of housing quality standards (HQS), compliance with the portability requirements for rental vouchers
and rental certificates, compliance with Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity program requirements, assistance
payment computation, timely submission of budgets and financial statements, and rent reasonableness requirements.
For purposes of this NOFA, an HA administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation
Program will not be rated on the administration of its Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering
a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program, HUD will rate HA administration of the
Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, Moderate Rehabilitation,
Public Housing or Indian Housing Program, HUD will assess the administrative capability of the HA based on such factors
as experience of staff, support of the HA by the local government, and the HA's administrative experience with non-HUD
housing programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Selection Criterion 2: Underfunding of Housing Needs (45 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The degree to which the housing needs of the primary area specified in the HA's application from which the HA draws families
to assist (primary area) have previously been underfunded, relative to the needs of other localities within the same
allocation area, taking into account such factors as the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income
renter households with housing problems, eligible for such assistance. The HUD State or Area Office/Native American
Programs Office will, wherever practicable, consider needs being met by all Federally assisted rental housing programs,
including the FmHA Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program, but will, as a minimum, consider assistance provided
under the Rental Voucher Program, the Rental Certificate Program, other Section 8 Programs, and the Public or Indian
Housing Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Notice PIH 91&hyph;45 (HUD), the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will
notify FmHA of applications it receives and ask that FmHA provide advisory comments concerning the market for additional
assisted housing or the possible impact the proposed units may have on FmHA projects. Applications for which FmHA
has provided comments expressing concerns about market need or the continued stability of existing FmHA projects,
with which HUD agrees, will receive zero points for this criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Rating and Assessment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To receive points under this criterion, an application must propose funding in an area which has been previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underfunded or proportionately funded relative to the need for housing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same allocation area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assignment of points is based on the degree to which the needs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the primary area specified in the application have been underfunded, taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income renter households with housing
problems. The determination of point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values will be based on a comparison of the percentage of housing need served 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the primary area specified in the application to the percentage of need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served in the allocation area since the 1990 census. The percentages for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation areas and the primary areas are to be rounded to the nearest whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate whether housing need in the primary area specified in the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been underfunded and will assign one of the three point-values, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;45 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been severely underfunded. A primary area with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of need served that is equal to or less than one-third the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation area's percentage will be determined to be severely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underfunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;30 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been moderately underfunded. An application with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of need served that is greater than one-third the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area's percentage but equal to or less than two-thirds of the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area percentage will be determined to be moderately underfunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;15 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been proportionately funded. An application with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of need served that is greater than two-thirds the allocation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application must describe the extent to which HAs demonstrate locally initiated efforts in support of their Rental
Voucher and Rental Certificate Programs or comparable tenant-based rental assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Evaluation of a locality's contribution is measured competitively by the extent to which a locality is
able to provide services or cash contributions or demonstrate its intention to provide this kind of support in the
future, as compared to services or contributions provided by other localities of like program size.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Programs Office will assign one of two point-values, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;5 points: The State or locality provides significant local support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., financial, manpower for inspection services) to its Rental Voucher or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rental Certificate Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;2 points: The State or locality provides minimal local support to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;0 points: The State or locality does not provide support to the HA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Selection Criterion 4: Efforts of HAs to Establish a Family Self-Sufficiency Program (10 points Deduction).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application must describe the efforts undertaken by the PHA to establish a Section 8 Family Self-Sufficiency
(FSS) program including (1) submission to HUD of an Action Plan, and (2) creation of a Program Coordinating Committee.
If a PHA is not administering a Rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Voucher or Rental Certificate Program, the HUD State or Area Office will rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA administration of the Public Housing FSS program, if applicable. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities rated under this criterion must have been completed prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of an application under this NOFA. The score of the PHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application must be reduced if the PHA received an FSS Incentive award of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8 funding in FY 1992 and the PHA has failed to complete the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation steps as described below. Also, the score of a PHA application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be reduced if the PHA received funding in FY 1993 (unless the HUD State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Area Office granted a total exception to the FSS program requirement) and

Opportunities for Families (5 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many HAs have undertaken voluntary efforts to provide area-wide housing opportunities for families. HAs in metropolitan
and non-metropolitan areas are eligible for points under this criterion. These HAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have established cooperative agreements with other HAs or created a consortium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HAs in order to facilitate the transfer of families and their rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance between HAs. In addition, HAs have established relationships with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-profit groups to provide families with additional counseling to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the likelihood of a successful move by the families to low-poverty areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being a member of an established consortium of HAs including at least 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the HAs in its housing market, providing extra counseling to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families, establishing a relationship with other groups including non-profit agencies, or participating in other
activities that facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area-wide housing opportunities for families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) After the 14-calendar day technical deficiency correction period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(refer to Section IV, Corrections to Deficient Applications, of this NOFA), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will disapprove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA applications that it determines are not acceptable for processing (refer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section III(F), Checklist of Technical Requirements, of this NOFA). The HUD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office notification of rejection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter must state the basis for the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applications that fall into any of the following categories will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be processed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Department of Justice has brought a civil rights suit against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant HA, and the suit is pending.

operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing a HUD approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct the areas of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) There are outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil rights

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a conciliation or compliance agreement designed to correct the areas of non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD has denied application processing under Title VI of the Civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 8.57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The HA has serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office management review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings for one or more of its Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, or, in the case of an HA that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Program, for its Public Housing Program or Indian Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The leasing rate for rental vouchers and rental certificates under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACC for at least one year is less than 85 percent, or, in the case of an HA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not currently administering a Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the leasing rate for all units available for occupancy in the Public or Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing Program is less than 85 percent. (For a State or regional HA, the HUD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office shall determine the HA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined leasing rate for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, and shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the combined rate in determining whether to accept the application under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The HA is involved in litigation and HUD determines that the

D. Local Government Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that HUD independently determine that there is a need for the housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance requested in applications, and solicit and consider comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to this determination from the chief executive officer of the unit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general local government. The HUD State or Area Office/Native American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs Office will obtain Section 213 comments from the unit of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local government in accordance with 24 CFR part 791, subpart C, Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Housing Assistance in Areas Without Housing Assistance Plans. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the unit of general local government must be considered before an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application can be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of expediting the application process, the HA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit a letter with the HA application commenting on the HA application in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Section 213. Since HUD cannot approve an application until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 30-day comment period is closed, the Section 213 letter should not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the application, but also state that HUD may consider the letter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the final comments and that no additional comments will be forthcoming from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the local unit of government.

less than 25 units, unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The HA requests fewer than 25 units; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The residual budget authority in using the rank order funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 25 units; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The total budget authority available to the allocation area will

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funding Procedure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HUD State or Area Office must develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure for approval of applications (including applications rated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native American Programs Office) for each allocation area in rank order until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the housing assistance budget authority is used. Where a HUD State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area Office funds applications according to rank order for each allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, only to find it has some number of units left, but not enough to fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next fundable application in its entirety or for the minimum of 25 units, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that application can be funded to the extent of the number of units available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve 100 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units requested in all applications that score above a HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum number of units allowed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve less than 100 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the units requested in all applications for each allocation area that score 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above a HUD State or Area Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of units allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If applications are to be funded at less than 100 percent of the units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested in the applications, the HUD State or Area Office must either (i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the same percentage of the number of units requested in each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application or (ii) divide approvable applications into two or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories, for example, those scoring over 80 points, and those scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 50 and 80 points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the HUD State or Area Office elects to divide applications into two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories, the HUD State or Area Office may choose to approve a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage for applications in each of the two ranking categories so that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher percentage of units requested would be approved for all applications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the higher category and a lower percentage of units requested would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for all applications in the lower category. The HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office must approve the same percentage of each application within each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two ranking categories unless there are insufficient funds to approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum 25 units. If the HUD State or Area Office is unable to fund all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for the minimum funding allowed in either of the two categories, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HUD State or Area Office must reduce the applicable percentage factor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the category in order to fund all applications for the minimum 25 units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(unless the HA requested less than 25 units or the total budget authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the allocation area will fund less than 25 units). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an HA applies for a specific program (i.e., rental vouchers or rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates) and funding for the specified program is not available in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan area or non-metropolitan allocation area, the HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office will award the available form of assistance, even though not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requested by the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HUD State or Area Office must promptly notify the applicable Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Programs Office for each allocation area as to the status of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications from IHAs and, if applicable, the amount of budget authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made available for IHA applications that were rated high enough to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding.

F. Reallocations of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each HUD State or Area Office must make every reasonable effort to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available funds. It may be necessary, however, to reallocate funds from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one HUD State or Area Office to another when the funds are not likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the HUD State or Area Office to which they were initially assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such cases, the following procedures shall be followed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reallocations Within the Same State. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the allocation of funds to a HUD State or Area Office cannot be awarded within the office jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during Fiscal Year 1994, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD State or Area Office in the same State where they can be used during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fiscal Year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reallocations Between States. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a HUD State or Area Office cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use funds within the same State, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another HUD State or Area Office for use in a State where they can be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during Fiscal Year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reallocations Between Metropolitan and Non-metropolitan Areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD State or Area Office must follow the original fund assignments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas when it reallocates unused budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority among allocation areas. If there are not enough approvable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for the designated metropolitan or non-metropolitan budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, the HUD State or Area Office may switch the budget authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area within the same State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that an offsetting switch can be made in another State within the HUD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by formula for rental vouchers and rental certificates. Funds in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in connection with natural disasters, litigation, desegregation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other housing emergencies, consistent with 24 CFR 791.407. Headquarters will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify HAs when they are eligible to receive assistance from the Headquarters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reserve and may invite the HAs to submit applications.

by HOPE I, HOPE II, and Section 5(h) activities; or assistance to non-purchasing families affected by HOPE II activities.
HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office requests for funding under this category will be approved
on a first-come, first-served basis after notification by HUD that an application for public housing demolition
or disposition, Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I, HOPE II, or Section 5(h) was approved. HUD State or Area
Office/Native American Programs Office requests should include all data pertinent to determining the eligibility
of the request for funding under the appropriate program and the amount of funds required. Replacement housing assistance
will be provided in the form of 5-year rental voucher or rental certificate funding. (Approximately 2,988 units and
$99.852 million in budget authority.)

(2) The application should include a narrative description of how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application meets, or will meet, the application selection criteria. Failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit a narrative description is not cause for application rejection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office can only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and rank the application based on information the Office has on-hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Offices and the number of units and budget authority available for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation area. HAs should limit their applications for the ``fair share'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to a reasonable number of rental vouchers and rental certificates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the capacity of the HA to lease all the units within 12 months of ACC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
execution. The number of units on the HA application may not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater of: (a) Ten percent (10%) of the total rental vouchers and rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates under reservation for the HA; or (b) 50 units.

D. Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires grantees of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to certify that they will provide a drug-free workplace. Thus, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA must certify (even though it has done so previously) that it will comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the drug-free workplace requirements in accordance with 24 CFR part 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Certification Regarding Lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, Public Law 101&hyph;121, approved October 23,
1989, (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the Byrd Amendment) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations on these restrictions on lobbying are codified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 CFR part 87. To comply with 24 CFR 87.110, any HA (other than an IHA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the definition of ``person'' in 24 CFR 87.105) submitting an application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this NOFA for more than $100,000 of budget authority assistance must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a certification and, if warranted, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist HAs, the texts for the Certification Regarding Lobbying and Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form LLL, Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying are available from the HUD State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Area Office.

apply to applications that, if approved, would result in the HA obtaining more than $100,000 in budget authority.
The Department has determined that IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of their sovereign
power are excluded from coverage, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from coverage. To comply,
HAs must submit an Anti-lobbying Certification and, if warranted, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.

IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To be eligible for processing, an application must be received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the date and time specified in Section II of this NOFA. The HUD State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area Office/Native American Programs Office will initially screen all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications and notify HAs of technical deficiencies by letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an application has technical deficiencies, the HA will have 14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days from the date of the issuance of written notification to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the missing or corrected information to the HUD State or Area Office and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native American Programs Office. Curable technical deficiencies relate only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to items that do not improve the substantive quality of the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the rating factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All HAs must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any such deficiency. Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received after 3 p.m. local time (i.e., the time in the appropriate HUD State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Area Office/Native American Programs Office), of the fourteenth calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejected as incomplete. All HAs are encouraged to review the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening checklist provided in Section III of this notice. The checklist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies all technical requirements needed for application processing. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA application that does not comply with the requirements of 24 CFR 882.204(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 887.55(b) and this notice, including the drug-free workplace certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the anti-lobbying certification/disclosure requirements, after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the 14-day cure period will be rejected from processing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on states or their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review under the Order. This notice is a funding notice and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially alter the established roles of the Department, the States, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local governments, including HAs.

has determined that this notice does not have potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the meaning of the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Order. This is a funding notice and does not alter program

published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088), and became effective on June 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of funding decisions are restrained by part 4 from providing advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department, should contact his or her HUD State or Area Office Counsel, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains.

F. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Branches of the Federal Government in connection with specific contract, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in connection with the assistance. IHAs established by an Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not excluded from the statute's coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Section 112 of the Reform Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b). Section 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the receipt of assistance.

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is publishing a consolidated listing of its institutions. The following institutions
have been added to the listing: Federal Correctional Institutions at Cumberland, Maryland; Greenville, Illinois;
and Pekin, Illinois; a Federal Medical Center at Carswell, Texas; and a Federal Transportation Center at Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma. The former Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Worth, Texas has been redesignated as a Federal
Medical Center. The Federal Prison Camp at Tyndall Air Force Base and the Federal Medical Center at Carville, Louisiana
have been closed and consequently have been removed from the listing. Finally, the names of certain Bureau institutions
located on military reservations have been shortened for the sake of consistency and ease of reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Interagency Coordinating Council (FICC) is established under section 685 of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1484a). The Council is established to: (1) minimize duplication across Federal,
State and local agencies of programs and activities relating to early intervention services for infants and toddlers
with disabilities and their families and preschool services for children with disabilities; (2) ensure effective
coordination of Federal early intervention and preschool programs, including Federal technical assistance and
support activities; and (3) identify gaps in Federal agency programs and services and barriers to Federal interagency
cooperation. To meet these purposes, the FICC seeks to: (1) identify areas of conflict, overlap, and omissions in
interagency policies related to the provision of services to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities;
(2) develop and implement joint policy interpretations on issues related to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers
that cut across Federal agencies, including modifications or regulations to eliminate barriers to interagency
programs and activities; and (3) coordinate the provision of technical assistance and dissemination of best practice
information. The FICC is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.
