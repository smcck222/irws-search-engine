<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to improve the licensing environment for advanced nuclear power
reactors to minimize complexity and uncertainty in the regulatory process. This statement gives the Commission's
policy regarding the review of, and desired characteristics associated with, advanced reactors. This policy statement
is a revision of the final policy statement titled ``Regulation of Advanced Nuclear Power Plants, Statement of Policy''
that was published on July 8, 1986. The purpose of this revision is to update the Commission's policy statement on advanced
reactors to reference the Commission's metrication policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 8, 1986 (51 FR 24643), the Commission published its final policy statement on advanced reactors in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission's primary objectives in issuing the advanced reactor policy statement were threefold:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;First, to maintain the earliest possible interaction of applicants, vendors, and government agencies, with
the NRC;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Second, to provide all interested parties, including the public, with the Commission's views concerning
the desired characteristics of advanced reactor designs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Third, to express the Commission's intent to issue timely comment on the implications of such designs for safety
and the regulatory process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 10, 1988, Congress passed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act [the Act], (19 U.S.C. 2901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, (15 U.S.C. 205a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Section 5164 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 205a) designates the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures
for U.S. trade and commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to effect an orderly change to the metric system, the Act requires that all Federal agencies convert to
the metric system of measurement in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end
of fiscal year 1992, ``except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies
or loss of markets to U.S. firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric
units,'' Section 5614(b)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Act, the NRC published its metrication policy statement for comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 10, 1992 (57 FR 4891). The purpose of the metrication policy statement was to inform NRC licensees and the
public how the Commission intended to meet its obligations under the Act. Comments on the draft statement were submitted
by 12 responders, including 5 power reactor licensees, 3 standards organizations, a reactor vendor, a materials
licensee, the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, and a joint letter submitted by three individuals. All commenters
supported the Commission's position and the final policy statement was published on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46202).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission supports and encourages the use of the metric system of measurement by NRC licensees and applicants.
However, Commission experience to date in design certification reviews is that it is impracticable and uneconomical
to convert a design to the metric system late in the design process and that applicants should consider metrication
early in the design process. Therefore, the Commission is revising the advanced reactor policy statement to incorporate
its policy on metrication to encourage licensees and license applicants to employ the metric system of measurement
wherever and whenever its use is not potentially detrimental to the public health and safety or is not economically
impracticable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Commission Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with its legislative mandate, the Commission's policy with respect to regulating nuclear power reactors
is to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety and the environment. Regarding advanced reactors,
the Commission expects, as a minimum, at least the same degree of protection of the public and the environment that
is required for current-generation light water reactors. Furthermore, the Commission expects that advanced reactors
will provide enhanced margins of safety and/or utilize simplified, inherent, passive, or other innovative means
to accomplish their safety functions. The Commission also expects that advanced reactor designs will comply with
the Commission's safety goal policy statement and the policy statement on conversion to the metric system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the attributes that could assist in establishing the acceptability or licensability of a proposed advanced
reactor design, and that therefore should be considered in advanced designs, are:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Highly reliable and less complex shutdown and decay heat removal systems. The use of inherent or passive means
to accomplish this objective is encouraged (negative temperature coefficient, natural circulation, etc.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Longer time constants and sufficient instrumentation to allow for more diagnosis and management before reaching
safety systems challenge and/or exposure of vital equipment to adverse conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Simplified safety systems that, where possible, reduce required operator actions, equipment subjected
to severe environmental conditions, and components needed for maintaining safe shutdown conditions. Such simplified
systems should facilitate operator comprehension, reliable system function, and more straightforward engineering
analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that minimize the potential for severe accidents and their consequences by providing sufficient
inherent safety, reliability, redundancy, diversity, and independence in safety systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that provide reliable equipment in the balance of plant (BOP) (or safety-system independence from
BOP) to reduce the number of challenges to safety systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that provide easily maintainable equipment and components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that reduce potential radiation exposures to plant personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that incorporate defense-in-depth philosophy by maintaining multiple barriers against radiation
release, and by reducing the potential for and consequences of severe accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Design features that can be proven by citation of existing technology or that can be satisfactorily established
by commitment to a suitable technology development program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If specific advanced reactor designs with some or all of the above foregoing attributes are brought to the NRC for comment
and/or evaluation, the Commission can develop preliminary design safety evaluation and licensing criteria for
their safety-related aspects. Combination of some or all of the above attributes may help obtain early licensing
approval with minimum regulatory burden. Designs with some or all of these attributes are also likely to be more readily
understood by the general public. Indeed, the number and nature of the regulatory requirements may depend on the extent
to which an individual advanced reactor design incorporates general attributes such as those listed above. However,
until such time as conceptual designs are submitted, the Commission believes that regulatory guidance must be sufficiently
general to avoid placing unnecessary constraints on the development of new design concepts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for more timely and effective regulation of advanced reactors, the Commission encourages the earliest
possible interaction of applicants, vendors, other government agencies, and the NRC to provide for early identification
of regulatory requirements for advanced reactors, and to provide all interested parties, including the public,
with a timely, independent assessment of the safety characteristics of advanced reactor designs. Such licensing
interaction and guidance early in the design process will contribute toward minimizing complexity and adding stability
and predictability in the licensing and regulation of advanced reactors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the NRC itself does not develop new designs, the Commission intends to develop the capability for timely assessment
and response to innovative and advanced designs that might be presented for NRC review. Prior experience has shown
that new reactor designs_even variations of established designs_may involve technical problems that must be solved
in order to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety. The earlier such design problems are identified,
the earlier satisfactory resolution can be achieved. Prospective applicants are reminded that, while the NRC will
undertake to review and comment on new design concepts, the applicants are responsible for documentation and research
necessary to support a specific license application. (NRC research is conducted to provide the technical bases for
rulemaking and regulatory decisions, to support licensing and inspection activities, and to increase NRC's understanding
of phenomena for which analytical methods are needed in regulatory activities.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the initial phase of advanced reactor development, the Commission particularly encourages design innovations
that enhance safety and reliability (such as those described above) and that generally depend on technology that
is either proven or can be demonstrated by a straightforward technology development program. In the absence of a significant
history of operating experience on an advanced concept reactor, plans for innovative use of proven technology and/or
new technology development programs should be presented to the NRC for review as early as possible, so that the NRC
can assess how the proposed program might influence regulatory requirements. To achieve these broad objectives,
the Advanced Reactor Projects Directorate (PDAR) was established in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. This
group is the focal point for NRC interaction with the Department of Energy, reactor designers, and potential applicants,
and coordinates the development of regulatory criteria and guidance for proposed advanced reactors. In addition,
the group maintains knowledge of advanced reactor designs, developments, and operating experience in other countries,
and provides guidance on an NRC-funded advanced reactor safety research program to ensure that it supports, and is
consistent with, the Commission's advanced reactor policy. The PDAR also provides guidance regarding the timing
and format of submittals for review. The Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards plays a significant role in reviewing
proposed advanced design concepts and supporting activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC believes that conversion to the metric system is important to the national interest. The Commission strongly
encourages its licensees and license applicants to employ the metric system of measurement wherever and whenever
its use is not potentially detrimental to the public health and safety or is not economically infeasible. In order
to facilitate use of the metric system by licensees and applicants, the NRC began publishing, as of January 7, 1993,
the following documents in dual units: new regulations, major amendments to existing regulations, regulatory guides,
NUREG-series documents, policy statements, information notices, generic letters, bulletins, and all written
communications directed to the public. Licensees and applicants should follow the guidance outlined in the Commission's
position and final policy statement on metrication published on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46202).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission adopted a final rule establishing standards governing the electronic dissemination
of information relating to transportation of natural gas. The standards generally reflected consensus agreements
reached by industry Working Groups composed of members from all facets of the gas industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties had proposed to include in the standards an electronic Index of Purchasers which would disclose certain information
about the capacity rights of shippers on pipelines. The Working Groups, however, were unable to reach consensus on
an approach, and a number of participants submitted alternative approaches. One proposal, supported by 44 participants,
was to replace some of the Commission's reporting requirements relating to firm and interruptible transportation
with an electronic Index composed of nine data elements, available in downloadable form.

The proposal would replace the Commission's initial and subsequent reports (but not the annual reports and bypass
reports) and the requirement to include an Index of Purchasers in pipeline tariffs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission found that this proposal had significant merit because it would provide useful
information to the market about capacity, while setting the stage for reducing filing burdens and streamlining the
Commission's reporting requirements. The Commission expressed interest in pursuing this proposal further and
instructed Commission staff to work with the industry Working Groups to develop a final proposal by September 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANR contends the Commission's order is not clear on whether the Index of Purchasers will be adopted upon the submission
of the September 30, 1994 report, without an opportunity for further comment. It argues that the Commission should
clarify whether this proposal is still open for discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, ANR questions whether the Index of Purchasers is needed to promote the Commission's capacity release
objectives. It agrees that such an Index does offer the advantage of reducing reporting and tariff requirements,
but maintains that, if the Commission adopts the Index for that reason, it should do so only if it concomitantly eliminates
the other reporting requirements. Finally, ANR argues that if the Commission requires information not covered by
the existing reporting requirements, the Commission must justify the inclusion of such information. In particular,
ANR contends the Commission should not require dissemination of competitively sensitive information.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission denies ANR's request that the Commission clarify that pipelines will not have to adopt the Index of
Purchasers and ANR's alternative request for rehearing. ANR's requests at this point are premature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission only expressed interest in pursuing the Index of Purchasers proposal, but
did not make a final determination on the issue. After receiving the September 30, 1994 report from the Working Group,
the Commission will evaluate the proposal and determine how best to proceed. As the Commission stated in Order No.
563&hyph;A, the Commission will comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and will provide notice and an opportunity
for comment prior to making any changes or revisions to the standards.

This document amends Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations concerning diseases subject
to presumptive service connection in former prisoners of war by stating that the statutory term ``beriberi heart
disease'' includes ischemic heart disease in former prisoners of war who had experienced localized edema during
captivity. The effect of this amendment is to broaden VA's interpretation of that term based upon new epidemiological
evidence.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1970, Congress passed Public Law 91&hyph;376, &sect;3, 84 Stat. 787, 788 (1970), which established a presumption
of service connection for seven categories of diseases and conditions, including ``beriberi (including beriberi
heart disease),'' developing to a ten-percent degree of disability at any time after active service in the case of
a veteran held as a prisoner of war in World War II, the Korean Conflict, or the Vietnam War who suffered from dietary
deficiencies, forced labor, or inhumane treatment in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The intent of Congress
was to recognize diseases suffered by former prisoners of war during captivity for which there is no medical documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern remained, however, as to the problems encountered by these veterans in their efforts to prove service connection
for disabilities attributable to the conditions of their capture and imprisonment. Some claimed that their ability
to prove service connection for disabilities was hampered because there are inadequate medical records and that
certain disabilities which were considered to be minor at the time of release from service were becoming more serious.
Congress therefore enacted the Former Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 1981, Public Law 97&hyph;37, 95 Stat. 935, which
eliminated the requirement that former prisoners of war must have suffered from dietary deficiencies, forced labor,
or inhumane treatment during confinement in order to qualify for the presumption of service connection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Early thiamine deficiency is characterized
by anorexia, irritability, and weight loss. Later, patients experience weakness, peripheral neuropathy, headache,
and tachycardia. Advanced thiamine deficiency presents with involvement of two major organ systems predominantly:
the cardiovascular system (the syndrome known as ``wet beriberi,'' i.e., beriberi heart disease) and the nervous
system, both central and peripheral (known as ``dry beriberi'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the Medical Follow-up Agency of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, issued a study entitled
``The Health of Former Prisoners of War'' which reported the results of a medical examination survey of former World
War II and Korean Conflict POWs and comparable control groups. That study found what it termed a noteworthy association
between ischemic heart disease and earlier reporting of localized edema of feet, ankles and legs_presumably due
to beriberi heart disease (wet beriberi)_while in captivity. While there is no known satisfactory explanatory biological
mechanism linking beriberi or malnutrition and subsequent chronic heart disease, the examination data from the
current study provides epidemiological evidence to suggest there is a connection between conditions during captivity
and the later development of ischemic heart disease. According to the study, the reporting of edema in prison camp
indicates a specific nutritional deficiency, beriberi, and the location of edema in the feet, ankles and legs is presumably
related to beriberi heart disease in prison camp which is caused by thiamine deficiency.

After reviewing this study the Secretary has determined, in keeping with the intent of Congress to provide a presumption
of service connection for former prisoners of war who have diseases which result from dietary inadequacies or unsanitary
conditions and for which service connection may be difficult to establish, that the term beriberi heart disease found
at 38 U.S.C. 1112(b)(2) includes ischemic heart disease if the former prisoner of war suffered localized edema during

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA's hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations do not apply to steel pipelines that operate at 20 percent or
less of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS). This final rule extends the regulations to three groups of these
pipelines: pipelines that transport highly volatile liquids, pipelines or pipeline segments in populated areas,
and pipelines or pipeline segments in navigable waterways. Accidents have shown that regulating these pipelines
or pipeline segments would be in the interest of public safety. Moreover, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 provides
that DOT may not exclude hazardous liquid pipelines from regulation based solely on operation at low internal stress.
The final rule responds to this statutory prohibition and will reduce the risk that hazardous liquid pipelines present
to public safety and the environment.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA's hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations do not apply to pipelines operating at a stress level of 20 percent
or less of SMYS (hereafter ``low-stress pipelines'') (see 49 CFR 195.1(b)(3)). DOT excluded these pipelines from
part 195 when it first issued the regulations (34 FR 15473; October 4, 1969). However, serious accidents have occurred
on low-stress pipelines, suggesting that this blanket exclusion is no longer in the interest of public safety. Moreover,
Section 206 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (PSA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508; October 24, 1992), amended &sect;203(b)
of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) (49 App. U.S.C. 2002(b)) to provide that ``[i]n exercising
any discretion under this Act, the Secretary shall not provide an exception to regulation under this Act for any pipeline
facility solely on the basis of the fact that such pipeline facility operates at low internal stress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 31, 1990, RSPA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on low-stress pipelines (55 FR 45822).
The notice described accidents and rulemaking recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We analyzed data received in response to that notice to learn the benefits and costs of regulating low-stress pipelines.
The analysis showed that many operators could face costs disproportionate to benefits if RSPA regulated all low-stress
pipelines subject to the HLPSA. So we focused on those low-stress pipelines that pose a higher risk to people and the
environment. We identified the commodity in transportation and the location of the pipeline as significant risk
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA then published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 12213; March 3, 1993) that addressed these risk factors.
The NPRM proposed to apply the safety standards in part 195 and the drug testing rules in 49 CFR part 199 to low-stress
pipelines that transport highly volatile liquids (HVL), traverse populated areas, or traverse navigable waterways.
These pipelines were targeted because failures of HVL pipelines usually result in more deaths and injuries than other
pipeline failures, and failures in populated areas and navigable waterways generally result in more damages to people
and the environment. Furthermore, the risk of outside force damage, a major cause of pipeline accidents, is greater
in populated areas and navigable waterways, making failures there somewhat more likely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules would address the statutory restriction (quoted above) on administrative discretion in regulating
hazardous liquid pipelines. The proposed rules also would respond to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380),
which requires DOT to regulate oil pipelines to prevent pollution of navigable waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed regulating four kinds of pipelines operating at 20 percent or less of SMYS: gathering lines, trunk
lines, inter-facility lines, and delivery lines. Unaffected were pipelines that part 195 does not cover for a reason
besides low operating stress. For example, the NPRM did not propose regulating low-stress rural gathering lines.
Part 195 does not apply to petroleum gathering lines in rural areas, regardless of the pipeline's operating stress
level (see &sect;195.1(b)(4)). Also, with regard to low-stress pipelines that do not transport HVL, the proposed
rules did not affect pipelines or pipeline segments that lie outside populated areas or navigable waterways. However,
controls or equipment on excepted segments that are necessary for the safe operation of pipeline segments inside
populated areas or navigable waterways (e.g., pressure controls) would have to meet part 195 requirements.

II. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the preamble summarizes and discusses the major written comments RSPA received on the proposed rules.
Comments related to the draft economic evaluation of costs and benefits are discussed in the Final Regulatory Evaluation,
which is in the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Extent and Nature of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comments by May 3, 1993. RSPA received 13 written comments. The comments came from seven pipeline
operators, one pipeline trade association (the American Petroleum Institute (API)), three state pipeline safety
agencies, one federal agency (the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)), and one public interest organization
(the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB, two state agencies, and one operator voiced general support for the NPRM. The rest of the commenters directed
their remarks to specific issues. Those issues are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Rural Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NRDC and a state agency suggested that RSPA should not continue to except non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural areas
from part 195. These commenters argued that people and the environment in rural areas deserve the same protection
as people and the environment in populated areas. They also said that serious accidents have occurred in rural areas,
and that low stress is not necessarily an indicator of low risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RSPA appreciates these commenters' concerns, we have decided not to expand the present rulemaking to include
the regulation of additional low-stress pipelines in rural areas. However, the need to regulate rural low-stress
pipelines not covered by the present rulemaking will be considered in upcoming proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from production lines (which are not subject to the HLPSA), most low-stress pipelines in rural areas probably
are gathering lines. Until passage of the PSA, rural gathering lines were not subject to regulation under the HLPSA.
However, the PSA enlarged RSPA's regulatory authority under the HLPSA to include, with certain exceptions, those
rural gathering lines that warrant regulation based on location and other risk factors. As required by Section 208
of the PSA, RSPA will consider regulation of those lines in a future notice of proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we will consider the need to regulate rural low-stress pipelines that are not gathering lines principally
on the basis of the risk the low-stress lines pose to the environment. Through response planning in cooperation with
other federal and state agencies under the Oil Pollution Act, we are developing a better concept of what constitutes
an environmentally-sensitive area for purposes of pipeline environmental regulation. This planning should provide
the groundwork both for the future notice of proposed rulemaking on rural gathering lines and for a rulemaking on other
rural low-stress pipelines.

D. Adequacy of NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
API commented on the impact of the proposed rules on inter-facility lines and delivery lines. It said the proposed
rules would significantly affect non-pipeline companies, such as refineries, petrochemical plants, and terminals.
But, according to API, these companies may not have been aware of the NPRM. API advised RSPA to publish a separate NPRM
directed at inter-facility and delivery lines, with at least a 6-month comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that another rulemaking notice is needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The published NPRM clearly discussed the proposed applicability of part 195 to inter-facility lines and delivery
lines. The NPRM gave all interested persons, including non-pipeline companies, an adequate opportunity to comment
on the proposed extension of part 195 to cover these low-stress pipelines. In addition, some non-pipeline companies
were aware of the NPRM, because representatives of refineries submitted comments. Other non-pipeline companies
should have been aware that RSPA was considering the need to regulate low-stress pipelines. As stated above, RSPA
published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on low-stress pipelines. Also, we specifically invited representatives
of the chemical, refining, and terminal industries to attend a meeting on low-stress pipelines (56 FR 23538; May 22,
1991). At that meeting, RSPA staff described all low-stress pipelines excluded from part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Economically Marginal Gathering Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comment on whether economically marginal gathering lines (i.e., lines which have little profit)
in populated areas should receive separate treatment under the final rules. One operator wanted to exclude from regulation
petroleum gathering lines that operate at less than 5 percent of SMYS and transport mostly sediment and water. The
operator said these lines present little or no risk, but the cost of regulation would be high because of the large number
of lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API and an operator said many low-stress pipelines in populated areas are associated with mature wells of diminishing
production. These commenters argued regulation would accelerate the marginal economic status of the lines. They
also suggested that more truck transportation would follow, with greater risk to the public. The operator particularly
asked RSPA not to regulate low-stress pipelines transporting crude oil that has a high flash point. These lines, the
commenter said, do not present a high enough risk to public safety to make regulation cost/effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API commented that RSPA should apply just a few regulations to pipelines made economically marginal by depleted oil
fields and low oil prices. It suggested that regulations applicable to leak detection would be enough. The remaining
regulations could be waived, API said, based on evidence of negative economic impact and low risk to the area. An operator
also suggested RSPA consider granting waivers for marginal systems based on evidence of a satisfactory safety program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB said regulation of a class of pipelines should be based solely on the threat to public safety and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator of economically marginal lines said that if safety is the goal of regulation, then profitable and marginal
lines should be treated alike. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To resolve the issue of economically marginal gathering lines, we looked at the number of lines involved, the burden
of the final rule, and alternative transportation. The record shows that gathering lines in populated areas comprise
less than 10 percent of low-stress pipelines subject to the final rule. Based on the comments, we believe only a small
fraction of this number is economically marginal, transporting small volumes of oil from older, declining wells.
These pipelines would be subject to the part 195 regulations, which, on the whole, parallel the industry standards
in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' B31.4 code, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Liquid Transportation Systems for Hydrocarbons, Liquid Petroleum Gas, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Alcohols. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The compliance burden, therefore, would be similar to the burden of meeting the minimum standards the pipeline industry
has set for itself. Alternative rail or truck transportation, although perhaps more expensive, is generally available
to replace any gathering line transportation that might be shut down. Thus, we do not believe regulation of economically
marginal low-stress gathering lines will cause a significant hardship to much of the industry. Also, the potential
safety and environmental risks of economically marginal gathering lines is probably higher than that of more profitable
lines because of the increased incentive to save costs. Consequently, we decided not to include special provisions
in part 195 for economically marginal low-stress gathering lines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, consistent with API's comment and RSPA's statutory authority, we will consider requests for waiver
of particular requirements. Any request should be based on evidence of significantly adverse economic impact, low
risk, and adequate operation and maintenance practices.

Proposed &sect;195.1(d) would have allowed operators of existing low-stress pipelines 1 year after publication
of the final rule to comply with parts 195 and 199. However, the NPRM requested comment on whether 1 year would be enough
time to prepare existing pipelines for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator said 1 year would not be enough unless RSPA excludes certain economically marginal gathering lines and
accepts previous hydrostatic testing. Otherwise the operator said 2 years would be needed to establish an adequate
compliance program. One operator said 1 year would be all right for HVL and trunk lines, but 3 years would be needed for
other lines. Another operator recommended 3 to 5 years for low-stress pipelines that present a low risk because they
carry crude oil with a high flash point. Still another operator said that because many distinct pipelines would be
brought under the regulations (possibly 3,000), the minimum compliance period should be 5 years. API and an operator
argued that 3, 4, or 5 years would be needed to carry out all the requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB argued that 1 year would be sufficient because many operators of low-stress pipelines have other pipelines that
are subject to parts 195 and 199. Also, NTSB said compliance would mostly involve procedural changes. It further said
written procedures and documentation are readily available for operators not already involved with parts 195 and
199. A state agency also said 1 year would be sufficient for operators to prepare for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the diversity of conditions and importance of plans, procedures, and testing, RSPA agrees that many operators
will need more than 1 year to complete the steps necessary for existing pipelines to meet parts 195 and 199. Of particular
concern is the time needed to craft plans and procedures that address the individual conditions of the many distinct
pipelines to which the final rule applies. However, operators should not need more than 90 days to learn about the new
requirements and begin reporting accidents that might occur on low-stress pipelines. Also, within 90 days operators
should be able to meet part 195 design, construction, and hydrostatic testing requirements on portions of existing
pipelines that they replace, relocate, or otherwise change after the effective date of the final rule. Therefore,
final &sect;195.1(c) allows existing low-stress pipelines 2 years from today to comply with parts 195 and 199. However,
accident reporting under subpart B of part 195 begins 90 days from today. Also, replacements, relocations, and other
changes made to existing pipelines on or after 90 days from today must meet the design, construction, and hydrostatic
testing requirements of part 195 before operation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the allowable compliance time for existing low-stress pipelines is stated in final &sect;195.1(c), instead
of &sect;195.1(d) as proposed. We made this change because under existing &sect;195.1(c), the deadline has passed
for carbon dioxide pipelines to comply with part 195 (July 12, 1992). Accordingly, the compliance time for carbon
dioxide pipelines is being removed from &sect;195.1(c). This change makes &sect;195.1(c) available to state the
compliance time for low-stress pipelines.

G. Populated Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA proposed to define ``populated area'' as ``any onshore area other than a rural area.'' Section 195.2 defines
``rural area'' as ``outside the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated
residential or commercial area such as a subdivision, a business or shopping center, or community development.''
So a populated area would be an onshore area inside such political, residential, or commercial area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator suggested we exclude industrial areas from the definition of populated area. Because of the lack of residential
housing and associated small businesses and shopping centers in these areas, the operator said regulation would
not increase safety. RSPA strongly disagrees, however, because the rules in parts 195 and 199 protect people at large,
not just people in residential communities. Plant personnel and the environment in industrial areas are at risk from
low-stress pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator asked if part 195 would apply to an entire line section between block valves if only part of the line section
crosses a populated area. As previously explained, the pipeline segment inside the populated area and any equipment
and controls located elsewhere that are necessary for operation of the segment would have to meet part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 195 currently uses the term ``populated area'' in &sect;&sect;195.234(e)(5), 195.260(c), and 195.306 (b)(1)
and (c)(1). We did not intend that the definition of ``populated area'' proposed in the NPRM affect these rules. We
proposed the definition merely to clarify the proposed applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines. Therefore,
the final rule does not contain a definition of populated area. Instead, final &sect;195.1(b)(3), which defines
the applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines, incorporates the substance of the proposed definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For similar reasons, we revised &sect;195.1(b)(3) to include the substance of the proposed definition of ``navigable
waterway.'' Section 195.412(b) uses this term, but we intended the proposed definition to clarify only the proposed
applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines.

H. Definition of Highly Volatile Liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 195.2 defines a ``highly volatile liquid'' as a hazardous liquid that will form a vapor cloud when released
to the atmosphere and that has a vapor pressure exceeding 276 kPa (40 psia) at 37.8
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F). A ``hazardous liquid'' is defined as petroleum, petroleum products, or anhydrous ammonia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter thought RSPA should amend the current definition of ``highly volatile liquid'' to exclude gas saturated
petroleum/water mixtures if the liquid remaining after release of the gas has a vapor pressure of 40 psia or less at
100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. However, the definition does not cover such mixtures. The deciding factors in the definition are (1) the vapor
pressure of the hazardous liquid in transportation; and (2) whether that liquid will evaporate into a vapor cloud
upon release to the atmosphere. In the commenter's example, the gas in the mixture is not relevant in determining the
vapor pressure of the hazardous liquid in transportation. Since the mixture without the gas has a vapor pressure of
40 psia or less, it is not a highly volatile liquid.

I. Hydrostatic Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to require that operators hydrostatically test new low-stress pipelines and existing low-stress
pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed. In addition, the NPRM proposed that within 1 year after
publication of the final rule, existing low-stress pipelines transporting HVL must have been hydrostatically tested
under subpart E of part 195 or not operate above 80 percent of a previous qualified test or operating pressure (proposed
&sect;195.302(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API suggested that RSPA allow 2 years instead of 1 year to complete the testing of existing HVL low-stress pipelines.
Considering the total effort companies will need to meet parts 195 and 199, RSPA agrees that 2 years is more reasonable
than 1 year to prepare for compliance. As stated above, final &sect;195.1(c) provides a 2-year compliance time for
existing low-stress pipelines. This compliance time applies to testing existing HVL low-stress pipelines under
subpart E of part 195. Therefore, a compliance time is not separately stated in final &sect;195.302(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for low-stress pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed, the NPRM did not propose to require
operators to hydrostatically test existing non-HVL low-stress pipelines. Furthermore, the NPRM explained that
non-HVL low-stress pipelines were not subject to the hydrostatic testing proposal in Docket PS&hyph;121 (56 FR 23538),
which affected many older existing hazardous liquid pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, under proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6), any non-HVL low-stress pipeline not tested to subpart E standards
could not be operated at more than ``80 percent of the test pressure or 100 percent of the highest operating pressure
to which the pipeline was subjected for four or more continuous hours that can be demonstrated by recording charts
or logs made at the time the test or operations were conducted.'' One operator suggested that proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6)
would have the effect of requiring hydrostatic testing of existing non-HVL low-stress pipelines. Testing could
be necessary if the requisite documentation were not available, or planned operations were not consistent with prior
documented test or operating pressures. RSPA did not intend this result. In fact, we proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6)
to assure that non-HVL low-stress pipelines could continue to operate without hydrostatic testing under subpart
E. Upon further consideration, RSPA believes proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6) is unnecessary for that purpose, since
&sect;195.302 clearly states which pipelines are subject to testing. So we have not adopted proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6)
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, &sect;195.406(a)(5) covers the substance of proposed &sect;195.406(a)(7), concerning the operating pressure
of HVL low-stress pipelines not tested to subpart E. Therefore, we have not adopted proposed &sect;195.406(a)(7)
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator thought the proposed rules did not clearly state the proposed exclusion of existing non-HVL low-stress
pipelines from hydrostatic testing requirements. RSPA agrees that subpart E should clearly state the applicability
of testing requirements to low-stress pipelines. Thus, we revised existing &sect;195.302, General requirements,
to clarify the exception of non-HVL low-stress pipelines from testing under subpart E.

J. Pneumatic Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comment on whether pneumatic testing should be allowed as an alternative to hydrostatic testing.
API and a state agency favored pneumatic testing as an alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three operators and a state agency encouraged RSPA to allow pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic testing.
They pointed out that pneumatic testing is permissible for low-stress pipelines in petroleum service under the ASME
B31.4 Code (section 437.4.3; 1989 edition). Two of these operators also favored pneumatic testing because it would
eliminate the need to collect and treat test water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator saw little advantage in pneumatically testing new low-stress pipelines, because the cost of waste water
disposal is not high for new lines. Two operators thought pneumatic testing would be hazardous for existing low-stress
pipelines because of the potential to mix hydrocarbons and air inside the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 195 now permits pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic testing (&sect;195.306(c)) for carbon dioxide
pipelines. Also, RSPA's gas pipeline safety standards allow pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic
testing (49 CFR 192.503). In view of these standards, the environmental advantages of pneumatic testing, and the
acceptability of pneumatic testing under the ASME B31.4 code, we believe subpart E of part 195 should allow operators
the option of pneumatically testing low-stress pipelines. Therefore, the final rule amends &sect;195.306 to allow
pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic testing on low-stress pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA recognizes that a mixture of air and residual hydrocarbons could create a potential hazard if operators pneumatically
test an existing low-stress pipeline with air instead of inert gas. However, this risk has not been a significant safety
problem for gas pipelines under 49 CFR part 192. It is common practice for operators to use proper precautions if air
is the test medium.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the NPRM, we have deferred proposing to regulate non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural ``environmentally
sensitive areas'' because we have not yet developed a suitable definition of ``environmentally sensitive area.''
We also need time to learn the extent to which pipeline spills affect such areas. Although the definition of ``environmentally
sensitive area'' in the oil spill response plan regulations (49 CFR part 194) has been used for planning purposes,
we believe that definition is too broad to use under part 195. A definition of ``environmentally sensitive area''
under part 195 must be specific enough to distinguish pipelines and segments of pipeline that are subject to the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by &sect;202 of the PSA, RSPA has scheduled publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking to define environmentally
sensitive areas, high density population areas, and navigable waterways. (See the ``Semiannual Regulatory Agenda''
at 59 FR 20662; April 25, 1994). We also intend to propose, as required by the PSA, to require all operators of hazardous
liquid pipelines (including low-stress pipelines) to identify and inventory their pipelines located in those areas
and waterways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRDC commented that there is ample evidence of pipeline damage in rural environmentally sensitive areas outside
navigable waterways, so RSPA should not postpone regulation of low-stress pipelines in those areas. NRDC suggested
that RSPA use a broad definition of environmentally sensitive area for purposes of regulating low-stress pipelines,
pending adoption of a definition required by the PSA. RSPA has not expanded the final rule to cover low-stress pipelines
in environmentally sensitive areas outside the proposed areas of regulation, because the NPRM did not propose regulation
of those pipelines at this time. However, we agree with NRDC's concerns about environmental risks, and we will consider
those concerns in future rulemaking proceedings on rural low-stress pipelines. As mentioned above, our increased
understanding of environmentally sensitive area in the pipeline context should provide a basis for future notices
of proposed rulemaking on rural gathering lines and other rural low-stress pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator thought RSPA should postpone the regulation of low-stress pipelines entirely until it proposes regulations
for non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural environmentally sensitive areas. This operator said additional work
and effort could be avoided if it could identify pipelines in environmentally sensitive areas before establishing
a compliance program for part 195. The commenter, however, did not address the potential loss of benefits that would
result if regulation of low-stress pipelines were deferred pending decisions on environmentally sensitive areas.
Nevertheless, RSPA believes that once compliance programs are in place, extending the programs to cover additional
pipeline segments, if required, should not be too difficult. Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent an operator
from bringing all segments of a pipeline into compliance with part 195 and immediately achieving the benefits.

L. Single Public Thoroughfare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM (at 12215), RSPA mentioned that ``intra-facility piping connecting adjacent facilities separated by
navigable waterways or separated by third party property other than single public thoroughfares in populated areas
would be subject to the regulations.'' A state agency and an operator asked us to clarify this single-public-thoroughfare
exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intra-facility piping mentioned in the NPRM is functionally equivalent to in-plant piping, which is excluded
from regulation under &sect;195.1(b)(6). Essentially, intra-facility piping is transfer piping used for plant
processes. However, plants may be divided by a single public thoroughfare, and transfer piping crosses the thoroughfare.
A public thoroughfare includes any road, from a country lane to an interstate highway, but not a railroad or navigable
waterway. Because the operating conditions of transfer piping that crosses such thoroughfares are comparable in
most respects to those of other in-plant piping, RSPA considers thoroughfare crossings to be in-plant piping. This
interpretation of &sect;195.1(b)(6) is in effect now. We will apply it to low-stress pipelines under this final rule.
The thoroughfare exception does not apply to inter-facility lines or delivery lines, because these lines are different
from in-plant piping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, representing a refining department, suggested that plant transfer piping that crosses property
other than a thoroughfare right-of-way, such as industrial property, should also qualify as in-plant piping under
&sect;195.1(b)(6). This commenter also suggested that RSPA exclude inter-facility lines in industrial areas from
regulation. Neither comment was adopted. We addressed the need to regulate low-stress pipelines in industrial areas
under the subheading ``G. Populated Areas'' supra.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One operator commented that the NPRM lacked justification for the proposed regulation of offshore low-stress pipelines.
RSPA disagrees because the accident consequences discussed in the NPRM and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking
could occur offshore. Also, the NPRM discussed the need to prevent pollution of navigable waterways, which includes
offshore areas. In the final rule, &sect;195.1(b)(3) clarifies the coverage of offshore low-stress pipelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One refinery operator suggested that RSPA except non-pipeline companies from part 199, if they have a comparable
drug program and few low-stress pipelines. This commenter's primary concern was the cost of administering two separate
anti-drug programs, the company's own program and another to satisfy part 199. RSPA believes this commenter may have
overestimated the burden of compliance with part 199. Operators with comparable programs need not begin a separate
part 199 program. They could modify their present programs as necessary to meet part 199 standards. Separate plans
would not be required, although the parts of a single plan intended to meet part 199 would have to be clear and distinct
from separate company requirements. Separate tests and analyses would be required only if the company's program
required testing for drugs not covered by part 199. Considering the savings in compliance costs for operators with
comparable programs and the continuing concern that illegal drug use may adversely affect the safe operation of pipelines,
we did not adopt the refinery operator's comment.

O. Marine Terminal Piping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One operator pointed out that the US Coast Guard already regulates certain low-stress pipelines at marine terminals.
This commenter recommended that RSPA continue to except these pipelines from part 195. Alternatively, the operator
suggested RSPA establish a jurisdictional boundary with the Coast Guard to avoid duplication of agency efforts.
A boundary, said the operator, also would eliminate the confusion over which DOT regulations apply to low-stress
pipelines at marine terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In port areas, RSPA and the US Coast Guard have independent regulatory missions, as assigned by federal statutes.
So, hazardous liquid pipelines in port areas come under a combination of RSPA and Coast Guard regulations. At present,
we know of no conflicts or undue burdens created by these separate regulatory programs. If such difficulties surface
with respect to low-stress pipelines, we will work with the Coast Guard to minimize their impact.

P. Miscellaneous Clarifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Pipelines Subject to Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenting on low-stress pipelines that cross navigable waterways in rural areas, API and an operator suggested
that the final rule clarify how much of the entire pipeline the regulations cover. The operator thought only that part
of the pipeline that actually crosses the waterway should be covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, for non-HVL low-stress pipelines, we intended to apply the regulations only to that part of the pipeline
in the populated area or navigable waterway. Final &sect;195.1(b)(3) clarifies this intended application by including
``or pipeline segments'' immediately after ``pipelines.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator thought the wording of the proposed compliance period (proposed &sect;195.1(d)) was inconsistent
with the proposed revision of &sect;195.1(b)(3). The operator thought proposed &sect;195.1(d) implied that operators
of non-HVL low-stress pipelines located outside populated areas and navigable waterways would have to comply with
the regulations within 1 year. To avoid this misconception, we changed proposed &sect;195.1(d) (now &sect;195.1(c))
to show that the compliance period applies only to existing low-stress pipelines covered by part 195. We also clarified
the wording of proposed &sect;195.1(b)(3) to better identify low-stress pipelines that part 195 does not cover.

2. Definition of Low-Stress Pipeline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another operator suggested the final rule define the various kinds of low-stress pipelines covered. As stated above,
the proposed rules affected several kinds of distinct pipelines that operate over their full length at 20 percent
or less of SMYS, such as trunk lines and inter-facility lines. Nevertheless, since the final rules do not refer to low-stress
pipelines by kind, there is no need to define each kind of low-stress pipeline the rules cover.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have, however, added a definition of the term ``low-stress pipeline'' to &sect;195.2, based on the present wording
of &sect;195.1(b)(3). The definition enabled us to clarify that a pipeline (in the sense of a continuing run of pipe
and components used for transportation) must operate from beginning to end at 20 percent or less of SMYS to qualify
as a low-stress pipeline. In drafting the final rules, the definition also allowed us to simplify the wording of several
proposed rules.

3. Applicability of Design and Construction Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One proposed rule simplified by using the term ``low-stress pipeline'' was &sect;195.401(c)(5). The purpose of
this proposed rule was to state that the design and construction requirements of part 195 would not apply to low-stress
pipelines on which construction begins before the effective date of the final rule. Several commenters thought proposed
&sect;195.401(c)(5) lacked clarity. So we revised it in the style of similar provisions of &sect;195.401(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, one commenter pointed out that proposed &sect;195.401(c)(5) would not except existing low-stress
pipelines from design and construction rules applicable to certain interstate and intrastate pipelines under &sect;&sect;195.401(c)(1)-(3).
The final rule resolves this drafting problem by excluding low-stress pipelines from the interstate and intrastate
designations under &sect;&sect;195.401(c)(1)-(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the regulations governing the subsistence taking of northern fur seals, NMFS is required to publish an
estimate of the number of seals expected to be harvested in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut
residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK. Additionally, this document amends existing fur seal regulations, making
the subsistence harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year. The intended effect of this rule is
to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents while minimizing
negative effects on the seal population.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The northern fur seal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Callorhinus ursinus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) population is considered depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (50 CFR 216.15(c)). The subsistence
harvest of northern fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, is governed by regulations found in 50 CFR part 215,
Subpart D_Taking for Subsistence Purposes, and has been regulated to minimize negative effects on the population.
These regulations were published under the authority of the Fur Seal Act, 15 U.S.C. 1151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the MMPA, 16 U.S.C. 1361 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see 51 FR 24828, July 9, 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of these regulations is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the
Pribilof Aleuts while using humane harvesting methods, and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The St. Paul and St. George Islands' harvest estimates are given as a range, the lower end of which can be exceeded if
NMFS is given notification and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), determines that the subsistence
needs of the Aleut residents from either of the islands have not been satisfied. Conversely, the harvest can be terminated
before the lower range of the estimate is reached if it is determined that the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts
have been met or the harvest has been conducted in a wasteful manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published a summary notice of the 1993 fur seal harvest on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58297). The proposed estimates
for the 1994 fur seal subsistence harvest and the proposed rule to make the harvest take estimates applicable for 3
years instead of 1 year were published on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25024). Following acceptance and consideration of public
comments on this proposal, NMFS is publishing this final notice of the expected harvest levels for 1994, as follows:
St. Paul Island: 1,645&hyph;2,000; St. George Island: 281&hyph;500. In addition, this document amends existing
fur seal regulations, making these take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS received four sets of comments on the proposed harvest estimates and the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter opposed the proposed amendment to the existing fur seal regulations. The commenter stated that NMFS
continues to allow the wasteful taking of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, and that the proposed rule change would
place NMFS in the position of endorsing and authorizing wasteful take for an extended period. The commenter asserted
that rather than addressing the wasteful seal killing that has persisted on those islands for years, NMFS, to the contrary,
now proposes to institutionalize this improper conduct for 3 years without further question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter voiced support for the regulatory amendment. The commenter reasoned that the take has been relatively
stable and the upper and lower limits of the estimate range were wide enough to allow change, and, therefore, as the
populations of animals and people vary, so can the target goals for future harvests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations on subsistence taking of northern fur seals have been devised to limit take to a level providing for legitimate
subsistence needs of the Pribilof Natives while minimizing negative effects on the seal population. These regulations
are intended, thus, as preventative measures against wasteful taking and improper conduct within each harvest season.
(Wasteful taking is discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993.) The rationale behind the 3 year estimate
of subsistence need versus an annual estimate was explained in the proposed estimates of subsistence need (59 FR 25024,
May 13, 1994). NMFS has recognized the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence (57 FR 34081,
August 3, 1992). As a first step towards addressing this need, NMFS proposed that &sect;215.32(b) of the fur seal regulations
be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. The regulatory amendment is based on the fact that the actual
number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent, and the fur seal take has never exceeded
the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest. NMFS anticipates that the
subsistence needs of the Pribilof Island residents may increase during the next 3 years. However, based on historical
evidence to date, the year-to-year subsistence needs are not expected to increase to levels exceeding the range established
in this final estimate.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter supported the implementation of a cooperative management plan as a means of protecting the fur seal.
The cooperative plan would expand governmental conservation efforts, and involve local people on the islands to
a larger extent in fur seal management issues. The commenter requested that particular effort be made to establish
a structure that will enable the residents of the Pribilof Islands to more actively participate in the monitoring
and regulating of the harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS agrees with the commenter's suggestions. Section 119 of the recently reauthorized MMPA allows for NMFS to enter
into cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations to conserve marine mammals and to provide for a co-management
of subsistence use by Alaska Natives. NMFS intends to pursue the development of such a program that would further the
goal of cooperative management and monitoring with the Alaskan native organizations.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the 1994 subsistence estimates are too high because they are based on historically wasteful
seal killing practices carried over from the period of commercial harvest when only the choicest cuts of meat were
taken for human consumption. The commenter continued by stating that through the adoption of these estimates, NMFS
further institutionalizes waste and sanctions a level of seal killing known to reflect wasteful practices.

 This comment is similar to the one presented and discussed in the final subsistence estimates for 1993 (58 FR 42027,
August 6, 1993). In that final notice, a commenter maintained that the present harvest level did not reflect the true
subsistence need on the Pribilof Islands. However, available information indicates that the present number of fur
seals taken for subsistence on the Pribilof Islands is not higher than necessary to provide for subsistence needs.
During one of the last periods when fur seals were taken solely for subsistence purposes on St. Paul Island, 1912&hyph;16,
the number of fur seals taken each year (range 1,764&hyph;3,483) was significantly higher than it is at present, even
though the human population on St. Paul Island at that time was less than one-half of the present population. Therefore,
the commenter has inaccurately assumed that practices carried over from the commercial harvest have resulted in
a level of subsistence use greater than that used historically on the Pribilof Islands.

A commenter stated that there is no basis for setting the lower end of the estimated subsistence range based on the greatest
number of seals killed during any year over the past 6 years.

 NMFS believes that the present range of fur seal subsistence estimates used on St. Paul and St. George Islands are justified.
During the past 3 years the number of seals taken in the subsistence harvest has stabilized, ranging from 1,482 to 1,645
takes each year on St. Paul Island and from 194 to 319 each year on St. George Island. Generally, the lower limits of the
estimate ranges for the islands have been approached during each of the past 3 years, but a difference of 1 or 2 actual
days of harvest between years can result in the difference observed between the estimated number and actual number
of seals taken within any one season. The apparent trend toward stability in the harvest totals on St. Paul and St. George
Islands indicates to NMFS that the proposed estimates of annual need accurately reflect the actual subsistence requirements
on the islands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the estimate of need should not be based on numbers of seals. Rather, it should be based on
the quantity of meat that is required for subsistence needs. The commenter provided data indicating that, by its calculations,
approximately 450&hyph;570 fewer seals could have been harvested on St. Paul Island in 1993 had the harvest estimates
been based on the amount of meat required by residents of St. Paul, rather than based on a number of seals required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter's estimate of the number of seals that need not have been killed in 1993 (450&hyph;570) was based on an
average maximum percent-use value of 60 percent. This value was a result of a 1987 study in which 83 seals were weighed
before and after virtually all consumable parts (including many parts that are only marginally edible, such as connective
tissues, etc.) had been removed (i.e., everything was taken except for the pelt, blubber, skull, neck, inedible internal
organs, and body fluids). This butchering technique is referred to as a whole cut, and a mean 53.3 percent of each animal
(maximum approximately 60 percent) was dressed out under these circumstances (53 FR 17773, May 18, 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1987 harvest, 101 carcasses were also weighed before and after butchering had removed only the front flippers,
shoulders, breasts, hearts and livers (referred to as the butterfly cut), the parts historically eaten. A mean 29.1
percent of each animal was dressed out under these circumstances (53 FR 17773, May 18, 1988). Thus, it was determined
that the range of percent-use values between animals that have been butchered to remove only selected parts, and animals
that have been butchered to remove virtually all consumable parts (including many parts only marginally edible),
lies between 29.1 and 53.3 percent of the initial carcass weight. Whether the harvest is being conducted in a wasteful
versus non-wasteful manner focuses on whether or not the butterfly cut method of butchering is interpreted as a wasteful
manner as defined in the regulations. NMFS determined, based on a 1992 study, that the butterfly cut does not represent
a wasteful manner of taking (discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1992 harvest, NMFS weighed the whole carcass, as well as the weight of each major body part (breast, shoulder,
arm, ribs, backbone, and hindquarter as well as heart, liver, front flippers, rear flippers, head, guts and pelt),
to determine the proportion of edible meat that was available from the different parts of the body for each of six fur
seals. In summary, the mean weight of the parts taken in a whole cut totaled 54.9 percent of the beginning weight of the
seals, and the mean weight for the parts constituting a butterfly cut was 32.5 percent, indicating a mean percent-use
difference of approximately 22 percent. However, using mean values from the 1992 study, the total amount of edible
meat (excluding bone, minimally edible connective tissue, and inedible tissue) available from a whole cut seal was
29.6 percent (range 26.8&hyph;31.6) of the beginning weight of the animal compared to 21.1 percent (range 18.9&hyph;23.4)
taken from a butterfly cut seal. Therefore, the average difference in the amount of edible meat between the two butchering
techniques is approximately 8&hyph;9 percent of the original body weight of the animal, not the 22 percent difference
that has been widely used to characterize the two different techniques, and that was used in the commenters calculations.
As NMFS explained in the 1993 document of final subsistence estimates, while a whole cut does result in more meat being
made available for subsistence use than does the butterfly cut, both cuts result in a substantial portion of the edible
parts of the seal being used for subsistence, and the real difference in edible meat being made available to the user
has been greatly exaggerated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter cautioned that NMFS must guard against economic incentives that might lead to higher harvest levels.
The commenter continued to state that NMFS should retrieve all seal penis bones or bacula to assure that potential
trade in these items will not result in excessive seal killing. The commenter did not feel that this was either unreasonable
or burdensome on the part of NMFS. Moreover, some Pribilof residents have suggested this approach as a means to reassure
concerned parties that the commercial value of seal bacula is not an incentive for harvesting fur seals.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS' position is that the subsistence harvest and the estimates of subsistence needs must not be based upon commercial
interests. There is no indication that the harvest is being driven by commercial interests; however, NMFS will continue
to monitor the disposal of carcasses, and the removal of bacula from animals taken in the harvest, to ensure that commercial
interests are not factors in the subsistence harvest.

One commenter stated that the subsistence harvest methods used by the Aleut sealers do not need to be monitored or regulated
to ensure compliance with NMFS' standards for substantial use of seal carcasses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations governing the subsistence harvest of fur seals require that NMFS' representatives monitor the harvest
and collect information on the number of seals taken and the extent of utilization of the fur seals taken (51 FR 24832,
July 9, 1986). NMFS believes that alternatives to the present fur seal management regime should be considered and
discussed during the development of a cooperation management program under section 119 of the MMPA. The commenters'
concerns will be considered further in these discussions and in any future rulemaking to revise these regulations.

Subsistence Harvest Estimates for 1994 Through 1996
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS published a document proposing a range of subsistence need estimates for 1994&hyph;96 based on the results of
the 1992&hyph;93 harvests (59 FR 25024, May 13, 1994). NMFS proposed that the lower bound of the harvest estimate for
northern fur seals on St. Paul Island for each year, 1994&hyph;96, remain at 1,645 (the same as that in 1992 and 1993).
If the Aleut residents of St. Paul Island reach the lower limit of the estimated range of animals during the harvest,
and still have unmet subsistence needs, they may request an additional number of seals, up to a harvest total of 2,000
fur seals. For St. George Island, NMFS also proposed that the lower bound of the estimate of subsistence need for each
year, 1994&hyph;96, remain at the 1992 and 1993 level of 281 fur seals. If the Aleut residents of St. George Island reach
the lower level of estimated need during the 1994 harvest, and still have unmet subsistence needs, they may request
an additional number of seals up to a harvest total of 500 (the upper bound estimated for the 1991&hyph;93 harvests).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Aleut residents of St. Paul and St. George Islands may harvest up to the lower bound of the applicable estimate between
June 23 and August 8 of each year, 1994&hyph;96. If, at any time during the harvest, the lower estimate of subsistence
need for an island is reached, the harvest must be suspended for no longer than 48 hours, pursuant to 50 CFR 215.32(e)(1)(iii),
pending a review of the harvest data to determine if the subsistence needs of the island residents have been met. At
such time, the Pribilof Aleuts may submit information indicating that subsistence needs (for either island) have
not been met. This information should be submitted as quickly as possible, optimally just prior to the time that notification
is given that the lower end of the harvest estimate has been reached in order to assure that the required harvest suspension
lasts no longer than 48 hours. If the Pribilof Aleuts substantiate an additional need for seals, and there has been
no indication of waste, the AA must provide a revised estimate of the number of seals required for subsistence purposes.
If additional information is not submitted by the Pribilof Aleuts, the AA will consider only the information in the
record at the time of the suspension. It is likely, under such circumstances, that the revised subsistence estimate
would remain the same as the original estimate. If that is the case, no additional takings would be authorized.

NMFS has determined that the approval and implementation of this document and amendment to the current regulation
will not significantly affect the human environment, and that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement
on this is not required by section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act or its implementing regulations.
This rule makes only minor changes to the regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes;
this action does not entail significant substantive revision. Because this rule does not alter the conclusions of
previous environmental impact analyses and environmental assessments (EA), it is categorically excluded by NOAA
Administrative Order 216&hyph;6 from the requirement to prepare an EA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

A 3-day extension of the north Washington coast (waters west of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line and south to the Queets River)
sport halibut fishery during June 9 through June 11 resulted in a harvest of 10,649 lb (4.83 mt). This brings the season
harvest to 65,298 lb (29.62 mt), 2,741 lb (1.24 mt) shy of the 68,039 lb (30.86 mt) catch limit. The remaining catch limit
is too small to allow for a full day of fishing without exceeding the catch limit. Therefore, the sport halibut fishery
in this area will remain closed for the remainder of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anglers landing in Neah Bay have caught an estimated 13,000 lb (5.90 mt) of Pacific halibut from Canadian waters. Fishing
remains open in Canadian waters with a two-fish daily bag limit and no size restriction. Anglers desiring to fish in
Canadian waters are strongly urged to contact Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans at (604) 666-0383/0583 for
sport fishing information concerning licensing and the nautical description of closed areas.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that an emergency exists in the groundfish fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management
area (BSAI). An unusually large number of salmon other than chinook (``other'' salmon) were caught incidentally
by trawl catcher vessels operating in the catcher vessel operational area (CVOA) during the 1993 pollock non-roe
season. In 1993, the number of ``other'' salmon caught incidentally in the BSAI groundfish fisheries was 245,000
fish_approximately six times the bycatch level estimated for each of the previous 2 years and triple the previous
highest bycatch amount. Approximately 95 percent of this catch is chum salmon. If not controlled, a large number of
chum salmon could be incidentally caught again during the 1994 pollock non-roe season, potentially causing serious
conservation and management problems. NMFS is implementing by emergency rule, certain management measures necessary
to address this problem. These measures are intended to accomplish the goals and objectives of the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) with respect to fisheries management in the BSAI.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared
by the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR part 675. General
regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At times, amendments to an FMP or its implementing regulations are necessary to respond to fishery conservation and
management problems that cannot be addressed within the time frame of the normal procedures provided for by the Magnuson
Act. Section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act authorizes the Secretary to implement emergency regulations necessary to
address these situations. These emergency regulations may remain in effect for not more than 90 days after date of
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, with a possible 90-day extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the number of ``other'' salmon caught incidentally in the BSAI groundfish fisheries increased significantly
over the 1991 and 1992 amounts of 36,000 and 39,000 fish, respectively. The 1993 total ``other'' salmon bycatch amount
was 245,000 fish_approximately six times the bycatch level estimated for each of the previous 2 years and triple the
previous highest bycatch amount of 72,000 ``other'' salmon estimated in the 1984 foreign trawl fishery. ``Other''
salmon bycatch was estimated to be below 10,000 fish, both prior to 1983 and between 1987 and 1990. ``Other'' salmon
is defined as salmon other than chinook salmon. Historical data indicate that approximately 95 percent of the ``other''
salmon bycatch in the Bering Sea is chum salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poor returns of chum salmon to western Alaska river systems during 1993 caused the Alaska Department of Fish and Game
(ADF&amp;G) to close commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries in several western Alaska districts. Projections
for 1994 are for below average returns in many districts. The salmon caught as bycatch in the 1993 pollock non-roe season
were primarily in the size range of 3-year-old fish, which would have matured in 1994. Little information exists about
the potential effect the 1993 chum salmon bycatch will have on the 1994 returns in western Alaska because stock composition
of the chum salmon bycatch during the pollock non-roe season is unknown. However, the magnitude of the 1993 chum salmon
bycatch in the pollock non-roe season is of concern, regardless of the origin of these fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To respond to this concern, NMFS, in consultation with the Council, implements the following three measures under
emergency rulemaking, to address the chum salmon bycatch problem in the 1994 BSAI pollock non-roe season: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Establishment of a 42,000 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit in the CVOA which, when reached, closes a portion of the
CVOA to vessels using trawl gear; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requirement for two observers on mothership processor vessels that receive groundfish caught in the CVOA during
the 1994 pollock non-roe season; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Requirement for electronic communication capabilities for each mothership processor vessel required to carry
two observers under this emergency rule and for each shoreside facility that receives pollock harvested from the
CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season that is required to have 100 percent observer coverage under 50 CFR 672.27
or 675.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures are described in detail and justified below.

At its April 1994 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS prepare emergency rulemaking that would provide the authority
to close an area within the CVOA to all vessels using trawl gear if the ``other'' salmon bycatch in the CVOA during 1994
reaches 42,000 fish. This measure is intended to prevent 1994 chum salmon bycatch numbers from approaching the level
experienced in the 1993 fishery. Establishing the bycatch limit at 42,000 ``other'' salmon accommodates pre-1993
levels while preventing excessive bycatch.

If the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit established for the CVOA is taken, NMFS will close the salmon savings area to
all vessels using trawl gear through November 12, 1994_the expiration date of this emergency rule. The salmon savings
area historically has accounted for a large proportion of ``other'' salmon bycatch and a relatively small proportion
of groundfish harvest. The recommended 42,000 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit represents 50 percent of the 1991,
1992, and 1993 average of ``other'' salmon bycatch in the CVOA. The 42,000 ``other'' salmon limit approximates the
1991 and 1992 bycatch, while providing some buffer to accommodate slight increases in bycatch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is intended to prevent a recurrence of the high 1993 chum salmon bycatch experienced during the BSAI pollock
non-roe season. The bycatch of ``other'' salmon appears to be a function of the time of year, distribution of fishing
effort, and spatial distribution of salmon. Historical data indicate that ``other'' salmon bycatch is reduced generally
during the winter months and elevated during the months of July through October. Approximately 67 percent of all ``other''
salmon bycatch in observed hauls during 1991 was taken during August, and 40 percent and 62 percent of the 1992 and 1993
``other'' salmon bycatch, respectively, was taken during the month of September. Starting in 1993, the opening of
the pollock non-roe season was delayed from June 1 until August 15 (58 FR 30997, May 28, 1993). This delay was implemented
to achieve increased revenues from the harvest of BSAI pollock during the non-roe season and to provide participants
in the pollock non-roe fishery increased opportunities to fish in other groundfish fisheries. Although the delay
of the pollock non-roe season until August 15 was expected to increase chum salmon bycatch, the magnitude of the 1993
bycatch amount was not anticipated. Spatially, the number of ``other'' salmon appears to be highest south of 57
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N. lat. and east of 168
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; W. long. Consistent with historical data, about 80 percent of the 1993 BSAI ``other'' salmon bycatch was taken
in the CVOA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis of historical observer data relative to the 1993 pollock non-roe season chum salmon bycatch was not available
prior to the Council's April 1994 meeting. Therefore, the recently discovered circumstances surrounding the 1993
chum salmon bycatch problem provided little opportunity for the Council to respond through normal rulemaking before
the opening of the 1994 pollock non-roe season on August 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered seven different alternatives for time/area closures to limit chum salmon bycatch during
the 1994 pollock non-roe season. The recommended area was chosen as a minimum closure area that would provide the most
consistent protection to ``other'' salmon during the pollock non-roe season, but would still allow access to productive
pollock fishing grounds. During the period July through October, the recommended salmon savings area accounted
for 1.0, 0.8, and 7.0 percent of the total annual observed groundfish catch in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod trawl
fisheries during 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. During the period July through October of 1991, 1992, and 1993,
this area accounted for 38, 40, and 54 percent, respectively, of the total annual ``other'' salmon bycatch. During
the period July through October 1993, the salmon savings area had the highest ``other'' salmon bycatch rate of the
areas analyzed_approximately 1.2 ``other'' salmon per metric ton of groundfish.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS must rely on data collected by NMFS-certified observers to manage the 1994 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit of
42,000 fish. Currently, one observer is required on each mothership processor vessel participating in either the
inshore or offshore component of the pollock fishery. Under a regulatory amendment effective May 20, 1994 (59 FR 18757,
April 20, 1994), all salmon taken in BSAI trawl operations must be retained until the number of salmon is determined
by a NMFS-certified observer. NMFS intends to use these observed counts to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit,
unless other information indicates that these numbers do not provide the best information available on salmon bycatch.
To monitor the chum salmon bycatch limit effectively and to prevent the 42,000 fish bycatch limit from being exceeded,
NMFS must receive daily reports of salmon bycatch numbers. NMFS typically receives weekly reports on groundfish
catch and on prohibited species bycatch to monitor the fisheries. The time required to process these reports results
in a delay between the receipt of reports and determination of overall catch statistics that provide the basis for
determining whether a closure is required. If the ``other'' salmon bycatch in 1994 were to proceed at the 1993 rate
(i.e., approximately 39,000 fish in week 1; 26,000 fish in week 2; and 47,000 fish in week 3), weekly reporting would
not be sufficient to prevent the 42,000 ``other'' salmon limit from being exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective monitoring of the bycatch limit requires a second observer on each mothership processor vessel that receives
fish from catcher boats fishing in the CVOA during the pollock non-roe season. This is necessary to ensure accurate
and timely counts of salmon bycatch, without compromising the other groundfish sampling duties of the observer.
Observers onboard mothership processor vessels currently sample approximately two out of every ten hauls. The time
required to count salmon bycatch under the May 20, 1994, regulatory amendment, and to transmit these data on a daily
basis, places an extra burden on observers stationed on mothership processor vessels. According to 1993 records,
the salmon bycatch rate was greater for mothership processor vessels (0.813 ``other'' salmon/mt groundfish) than
for shoreside plants (0.343 ``other'' salmon/mt groundfish). NMFS will require the additional observers to remain
onboard the mothership processor vessels until either (1) the salmon savings area is closed, or (2) the salmon bycatch
rates are sufficiently low such that daily observer reports are no longer needed to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch
limit established for the CVOA.

The observer requirements and the requirements for electronic communication capabilities are necessary for NMFS
to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit effectively. The affected mothership processing vessels and processors
must obtain for observers' use the data entry software program provided by the Regional Director. To enable the observers
to report haul-by-haul statistics and salmon bycatch numbers on a daily basis, the operator of each mothership processor
vessel that receives fish harvested in the CVOA must provide INMARSAT Standard A satellite communication capabilities
and associated software (cc:Mail remote and a data entry program provided by the Regional Director) for observers'
use. Each mothership processor vessel must also have the following equipment or equipment compatible therewith
and having the ability to operate the NMFS-supplied data entry software program: a personal computer (PC) with a 386
or better processing chip, a DOS version 3.0 operating system, and 5 megabytes of free hard disk storage available
for the observers' use. Each shoreside facility that receives pollock harvested in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock
non-roe season and that is required to have 100-percent observer coverage under 50 CFR 672.27 and 675.25, must have
the capability to transmit data over telephone lines using a computer modem. These processors will make available
to observers the following equipment or equipment compatible therewith: a PC with a 386 or better processing chip,
with at least a 9600 baud modem, and a phone line. The PC must be equipped with a mouse, Windows version 3.1 or a program
having the ability to operate the NMFS-supplied data entry software program, and have at least 5 megabytes of free
hard disk storage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pollock harvests during the non-roe season are apportioned between the ``inshore'' and the ``offshore'' components.
During the 1993 non-roe season, the inshore component was comprised of seven shoreside processing plants, one mothership
processor vessel, and five trawl catcher/processors. These processors processed approximately 235,000 mt of pollock.
The offshore component was comprised of three mothership processors and 52 trawl catcher/processors. Sixteen of
these trawl catcher/processors also received pollock deliveries from catcher vessels. The offshore component
harvested about 414,000 mt of pollock during the directed non-roe season fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-five trawl catcher vessels delivered pollock to shoreside processing plants and 25 trawl catcher vessels
delivered pollock to mothership processors. These 90 catcher vessels delivered about 233,000 mt of pollock to shoreside
processing plants and 121,000 mt to mothership processor vessels, for a total of about 354,000 mt of pollock. Therefore,
trawl catcher vessels harvested about 55 percent of the pollock during the 1993 non-roe season and trawl catcher/processors
harvested about 45 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The salmon savings area is completely within the CVOA. Closure of this area would affect only the pollock harvest areas
available to trawl catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processing plants and mothership processor vessels.
Most of the harvest by these catcher vessels during the 1993 non-roe season occurred within the CVOA. Preliminary
examination of 1993 ADF&amp;G fish tickets indicates that at least five out of seven shoreside processing plants
received some pollock harvested within the salmon savings area during the 1993 pollock non-roe season. Harvests
within the salmon savings area represented about 10 percent of the total 1993 non-roe season pollock harvests by trawl
catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processing plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure of the salmon savings area would only occur if the salmon bycatch limit was reached and would not affect significantly
the opportunity available to catcher vessels to harvest available pollock TAC. Most of the area within the CVOA that
is currently available to the catcher vessels would remain open to pollock fishing. Based on 1993 non-roe season fishing
patterns, closure of the salmon savings area would have resulted in relocation of catcher vessels within the Bering
Sea for less than 10 percent of their pollock harvests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The observer and equipment requirements of this action apply only to mothership processing vessels or shoreside
processing plants receiving fish caught by catcher vessels from the CVOA. Direct costs are limited to those participants,
estimated to be four mothership processing vessels and seven shoreside processing plants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Direct costs for observer coverage are estimated to be about $200 per day per observer. The cost of a second observer
on the four mothership processor vessels would depend on the number of days the additional observer was required.
The number of observer days for each mothership processor vessel during the 1993 non-roe season ranged from 39 to 58
days. Based on the observer coverage requirements for 1993, a second observer during the 1994 non-roe season could
cost from $7,800 (39 days x $200/day) to $11,600 (58 days x $200/day) per mothership processor vessel. Based on the
actual number of fishing days, the total cost for all four mothership processor vessels would be $37,400 (187 days
x $200/day), if the second observer were required for the same amount of observer coverage days as during the 1993 non-roe
season. If the second observer is required for only a portion of the 1994 non-roe season, additional observer costs
would be $200 per day per mothership processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs could also be incurred for the acquisition of electronic mail software and a personal computer that satisfies
the hardware requirements detailed above. The cost for these items could range from $200&hyph;1200. Mothership
processing vessels have the INMARSAT A satellite communication capabilities and necessary computer hardware,
and most shoreside facilities have the necessary computer hardware for electronic transmission of data. NMFS will
supply the necessary data entry software and will provide installation free of charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure of the salmon savings area to vessels using trawl gear will also affect any trawl vessels that may have otherwise
fished in this area in non-pollock target fisheries. However, examination of 1993 catch information indicates that
no significant amounts of other groundfish fishing or pollock Community Development Quota fishing occurred in the
salmon savings area subsequent to closure of the directed inshore and offshore component pollock fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management measures responding to the information recently presented to the Council are necessary to mitigate potentially
adverse impacts of chum salmon bycatch on western Alaska salmon resources and to reduce chum salmon bycatch in 1994.
NMFS is implementing this emergency action for the 1994 pollock non-roe season because the high chum salmon bycatch
occurred primarily in the pollock non-roe season in 1993 and a large proportion of this bycatch occurred in the salmon
savings area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS concurs that the above regulatory measures must be implemented by emergency rulemaking to prevent high bycatch
of chum salmon by catcher vessels fishing for groundfish in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season.

(b) Each mothership processor vessel that receives groundfish harvested by catcher vessels in the catcher vessel
operational area, defined at &sect;675.22(g), during the 1994 second pollock season that starts on August 15 under
&sect;675.23(e), is required to have a second NMFS-certified observer onboard, in addition to the observer required
under &sect;672.27(c)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this chapter. Two observers must be onboard for each day of the 1994 second
pollock season until either the salmon savings area is closed under &sect;675.22(h) or the Regional Director determines
that the bycatch rates of non-chinook salmon are sufficiently low such that daily observer reports are no longer needed
to monitor the 1994 non-chinook salmon bycatch amounts.
