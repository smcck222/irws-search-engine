 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Cessna Citation Model 500/501, 550/551, S550, 552, and 560 series airplanes. That action would have required
modification of the landing light electrical circuit to eliminate failures of the left and right landing light switches
due to heavy current at the switch contacts. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
has received additional data that confirm that failure of the subject switches does not pose an unsafe condition.
Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add a new airworthiness directive
(AD), applicable to certain Cessna Citation Model 500/501, 550/551, S550, 552, and 560 series airplanes, was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 12, 1993 (58 FR 19069). That action was prompted by a report of failures of the left and right landing light switches
due to heavy current at the switch contacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have required modification of the landing light electrical circuit. The intent of the modification
was to preclude the possibility of failure of the landing light switches, which could lead to smoke and an electrical
fire in the cockpit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received additional data gathered from an analysis that was conducted
of the switch failure scenarios and the landing light switch design itself. These data indicate that the switch can
adequately carry the current associated with either incandescent or halogen landing light installations. Apparently,
the landing light switches that were involved in the reported incidents were of poor quality and were produced in only
a small limited batch. The failure scenario analysis indicates that the switches shorted internally, allowing an
odor and a trace of smoke to be released in the cockpit. In each case, however, the amount of smoke that was produced neither
created a hazard nor interfered in any way with the safe operation of the aircraft. Further, contrary to what was previously
reported, no fire occurred during any of the incidents as a result of the switch failure; the only identified discrepancy
in some of the incidents was the discoloration of the switch cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, further investigation of one of the reported incidents revealed that a wire connected to one of the
failed switches had discolored due to overheating caused by an undersized wire splice. (The undersized wire splice
may have been installed as a result of questionable maintenance.) This parictular problem is considered to be an isolated
incident and independent of the switch problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been no further failures of these switches since the original incidents that were reported (in 1992). As
the limited number of suspect switches have appeared to have been purged from aircraft service by attrition, no recent
failures have occurred. In addition, the FAA has not received any recent Malfunction or Defect Reports concerning
these switches. This reduction in such reports supports the premise that poor quality switches are no longer found
in the operators' inventories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the recent analysis data and other evidence presented, the FAA concludes that the switch failures are internal
to the switch itself and do not cause sufficient smoke or arcing in the cockpit to create a hazardous condition. The
FAA has determined that failure of the subject switches does not present an unsafe condition. Accordingly, the proposed
rule is hereby withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, that currently requires inspection of the wing rear spar lower cap aft
tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill to detect fatigue cracking, and repair, if necessary. This
action would require installation of a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap, and follow-on
inspections. This proposal is prompted by reports of additional cracking found in the current inspection area. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent propagation of cracks in the subject area, which could
compromise the structural integrity of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 25, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;8052 (56 FR 50650, October 8, 1991),
which is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive
inspections to detect fatigue cracking of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and the wing trailing edge access door
sill, and repair of any cracking found. That action was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the wing rear
spar lower cap aft tang on four Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes. This cracking was found during an inspection conducted
in accordance with the Supplemental Inspection Document (SID) program; that program was required to be implemented
by AD 89&hyph;22&hyph;10, amendment 39&hyph;6330 (54 FR 42291, October 16, 1989). The requirements of AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05
are intended to prevent fatigue cracking in the subject area. Such cracking, if not detected and corrected in a timely
manner, could compromise the structural integrity of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, there have been 10 additional reports of fatigue cracks found in the wing rear spar lower
cap aft tang. Such cracking presents the same unsafe condition as addressed by the existing AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the issuance of that AD, the manufacturer has developed a crack preventative modification of
the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and wing trailing edge access door sill that is intended to minimize the possibility
of cracking in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57&hyph;123, Revision 1, dated June
8, 1993, which contains procedures for conducting various inspections to detect fatigue cracking of the wing rear
spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill, and procedures for repairing any cracking
found. This revised service bulletin is essentially identical to the original version, which was referenced in AD
91&hyph;21&hyph;05 as the appropriate source of service information. The only relevant changes are a revised listing
of current operators of affected airplanes, and the inclusion of additional repair options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has also reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 57&hyph;123, dated June 8, 1993, that describes
procedures for installing a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and wing trailing
edge access door sill. This modification entails replacing Taper-Lok fasteners with straight titanium fasteners,
and cold working the holes in the wing rear spar lower cap forward and aft tangs between stations X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
=430.000 and X

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
ors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
=410.000. Accomplishment of this modification will minimize the possibility of fatigue cracking in the subject
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05 to continue to require repetitive inspections of
the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill to detect fatigue cracking,
and repair of any cracking found. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with either the
original or revised version of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57&hyph;123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed AD would also require the eventual installation of the crack preventative modification. Once this
modification is accomplished, repetitive post-modification inspections would be required after the accumulation
of a certain number of landings. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with McDonnell Douglas
Service Bulletin 57&hyph;123.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 282 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 175 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The currently required inspections take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the current inspection requirements of this
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,000, or $440 per airplane, per inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification would take approximately 12 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per
work hour. Required parts would cost between $3,730 and $6,730 per airplane, depending upon the airplane model. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be between $4,390 and $7,390 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed post-modification inspections would take approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed post-modification
inspection requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $115,500, or $660 per airplane, per inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
current or proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is proposing amendments to its rule governing ethics training
for registrants to provide additional guidance relative to ethics training providers. The proposed amendments
would: allow a person to provide ethics training if he certifies to a registered futures association that he is not
subject to statutory disqualification from registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (Act), barred from service
on self-regulatory organization (SRO) governing boards or committees, or subject to a pending proceeding or investigation
with respect to possible violations of the Act or rules or orders promulgated thereunder; prohibit certain representations
with respect to a person's status as an ethics training provider; prohibit an ethics training provider from using
that fact to qualify as an expert witness in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission or from proffering evidence
of that fact to qualify as an expert witness in any adjudicatory proceeding to which the Commission is a party; allow
wider use of ethics training presentation by interactive means and videotape; and require ethics training providers
to furnish records of attendees to a registered futures association upon request.

This provision of the Act is codified at 7 U.S.C. 6p(b) (Supp. IV 1992) and states that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission shall issue regulations to require new registrants, within 6 months after receiving such registration,
to attend a training session, and all other registrants to attend periodic training sessions, to ensure that registrants
understand their responsibilities to the public under this Act, including responsibilities to observe just and
equitable principles of trade, any rule or regulation of the Commission, any rule of any appropriate contract market,
registered futures association, or other self-regulatory organization, or any other applicable Federal or state
law, rule or regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has reviewed several applications from persons seeking to provide ethics training to registrants
and several other applications are currently pending with the Commission. In light of this experience, the Commission
is now proposing amendments to Rule 3.34 regarding ethics training providers in an effort to enhance the operation
of this program. Those provisions of the rule that relate to what must be covered in ethics training and specific requirements
concerning attendance at such training by registrants would remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Certification by Ethics Training Provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presently, there are three categories of persons that may provide ethics training to registrants under the Act: (1)
an SRO, such as an exchange which may have a program for its member floor brokers (FBs) and floor traders (FTs); (2) an
entity accredited to conduct continuing education programs by a state professional licensing authority in the fields
of law, finance, accounting or economics; or (3) any other person ``if its program is approved by the Commission for
this purpose.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposals set forth herein would maintain SROs and state-accredited continuing education programs as ethics
providers. The Commission is also proposing, however, to permit any other person to provide ethics training if the
person files a notice with a registered futures association certifying that the person, any principals thereof (as
defined in Commission Rule 3.1(a))
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and any individuals, on behalf of such person, who conduct in-person ethics training or who prepare ethics training
videotape or electronic presentations, are not subject to: (1) statutory disqualification from registration under
Sections 8a (2) or (3) or the Act;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (2) a bar from service on SRO governing boards or committees based on disciplinary histories, pursuant to Commission
Rule 1.63
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or any SRO rule adopted thereunder;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) a pending adjudicatory proceeding under Sections 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8a or 9 of the Act or Commission Rules 3.55,
3.56 or 3.60;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or (4) a pending investigation by the Commission's Division of Enforcement of which the subject has been notified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Congressional mandate for ethics training is intended ``to ensure that registrants understand their responsibilities
to the public under [the] Act, including responsibilities to observe just and equitable principles of trade, any
rule or regulation of the Commission, any rules of any appropriate contract market, registered futures association,
or other self-regulatory organization or any other applicable Federal or State law, rule or regulation.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that it would be anomalous, inconsistent with the Congressional mandate and contrary to
the public interest for a person to teach others about their responsibilities under those laws and rules if such person
has a disciplinary history that would disqualify him from registration under the Act or service on SRO governing broads
or committees, or is involved in an adjudicatory proceeding or the subject of an investigation pertaining to violations
of such laws and rules. The Commission is also proposing that the certification requirement be a continuous one so
that if circumstances change and the certification becomes inaccurate, the person must so inform the registered
futures association, which shall then refuse to include such person on, or remove such person from, the list of ethics
training providers.

However, if a firm is subject to a pending adjudicatory proceeding or investigation as described above, the Commission
believes that it could submit a certification to a registered futures association with an explanation describing
the circumstances of the proceeding or investigation, particularly with respect to the scope and nature of the proceeding
or investigation in relation to the size of the firm. For example, an investigation limited to a single branch office
of a firm that does not involve fraud or failure to supervise might be treated differently than a proceeding involving
such allegations against the top management of a firm. The Commission would expect the registered futures association
to consult the Commission as to any particular certification submitted or in cases where a firm on the list becomes
subject to a proceeding or investigation.

The purpose of this amendment is to permit National Futures Association (NFA), currently the only registered futures
association, to maintain the list of eligible ethics training providers for purposes of Commission Rule 3.34 and
to clarify that the specific content of an ethics training program is not being approved by the Commission or by NFA,
as discussed more fully below. The Commission would delegate authority to NFA to establish guidance as to the required
experience of ethics training providers and permit NFA to receive and evaluate complaints concerning such providers
and make other appropriate review of providers' operations, subject to Commission oversight. NFA would also be delegated
authority to develop appropriate procedures to verify certifications filed by a potential ethics training provider,
for having such certifications updated periodically and for refusing to include persons on the list of ethics training
providers.

When the Commission has granted applications to provide ethics training, it has stated in letters to the applicants,
among other things, that it has not approved the specific content of the ethics training program proposed and expresses
no opinion as to the program's quality or accuracy. Indeed, it would be impossible for the Commission to do so since
it has normally been presented with only an outline of the training course from those who filed applications.

 The Commission therefore believes that it is appropriate to clarify the effect of the blanket reference in Rule 3.34

registered futures association's listing of other persons providing such training.

Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to provide in new paragraph (b)(5)(i) that no SRO, state-accredited continuing
education entity or other person included on a list of ethics training providers ``may represent or imply in any manner
whatsoever that such person has been sponsored, recommended or approved, or that such person's abilities or qualifications,
the content, quality or accuracy of his training program, or the positions taken in the course of resolving any actual
or hypothetical situations presenting ethical issues, have in any respect been passed upon or endorsed, by the Commission
or a registered futures association.'' Proposed new paragraph (b)(5)(i) would further provide that any promotional
or instructional material used in connection with ethics training ``must prominently state that the Commission
and any registered futures association have not reviewed or approved the specific content of the training program
and do not recommend the provider of such training.''

that a person is included on a list of ethics training providers maintained by a registered futures association if
such statement is true in fact and if the effect of such a listing is not misrepresented.'' The effect of this statement
is intended to be that such person is not precluded from providing ethics training by reason of ``unfitness'' as defined
by the Act and the Commission's rules on statutory disqualification.

The Commission believes that these clarifications with respect to representations that may be made as to the effect
of providing ethics training, whether pursuant to self-executing provisions of the rule or to inclusion on a list
maintained by a registered futures association, are appropriate, particularly in light of existing limitations
upon the representations that may be made by registered commodity trading advisors (CTAs), commodity pool operators
(CPOs) or associated persons (APs) of CTAs and CPOs as to the effect of registration under the Act, which encompasses
a greater level of review than pertains to ethics providers.

The Commission similarly believes that it is appropriate to limit the use an ethics training provider may make of that
fact in certain adjudicatory proceedings. An ethics training provider should not be able to use that fact to qualify
as an expert witness or to present expert testimony in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission under Sections
6(c), 6(d), 8a or 14 of the Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nor should an ethics training provider proffer evidence of that fact in order to demonstrate experience, competence
or knowledge that would qualify the provider as an expert witness in any adjudicatory proceeding to which the Commission
is a party, for example, a civil injunctive action brought by the Commission under Section 6c of the Act (7 U.S.C. 13c
(Supp. IV 1992)). The Commission is therefore proposing new paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii) to so provide.
The Commission believes that because the rule amendments proposed herein provide for a person to be included on a list
of ethics providers based on a self-certification process, it would be inappropriate for any person included on such
a list to use that fact to demonstrate credentials as an expert witness. The Commission would not consider evidence
of a person's status as an ethics provider in any administrative proceeding before it, and would object to any such
proffer in any adjudicatory proceeding to which it is a party.

When the Commission adopted Rule 3.34, it provided in paragraph (b)(3) that a program of ethics training could include
a videotape or electronic presentation. The Commission stated that such training would be acceptable if the provider
could substantiate the registrant's completion of the program. The Commission further stated that such substantiation
contemplates, for example, an interactive computerized training program that requires and records the registrant's
participation and return of such computer disk to the ethics training provider for verification of such participation
and the provider's issuance of a certificate to that effect to the registrant.

The Commission had originally proposed allowing the use of videotape or electronic presentation in recognition
of the fact that it could be difficult for registrants located substantial distances from major metropolitan areas
to attend in-person training sessions without incurring significant expense or business disruption.

 One contract market commenter on the Commission's proposal stated that all registrants should have the opportunity
to use an interactive computer program. Since all of the contract markets are located in major metropolitan areas,
the Commission responded by expressing its belief that FTs and FBs will generally attend in-person training sessions
sponsored by a contract market. The Commission also indicated, however, that it ``may consider in its review of proposed
ethics training courses whether a particular proposal that includes an interactive computer program would be appropriate
for those whom attendance at an in-person session would not be unduly burdensome.''

Most of the persons authorized to provide ethics training to date currently do so by means of in-person presentation.
Originally, a firm authorized to provide such training by means of videotape or electronic presentation was required
to represent that videotape or electronic training would be limited to registrants who live in locations outside
those metropolitan areas where in-person training will be given and for those registrants that can provide a valid
excuse for their inability to attend sessions in those cities. The firm was further required to represent that it would
review all excuses given by registrants for being unable to attend an in-person program in their metropolitan areas
and would assure that each such registrant is unable to attend due to illness, vacation, business trips or other commitments
that genuinely precluded his presence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, the Commission's staff received several inquiries, both from existing ethics training providers
and potential new providers, concerning the offering of interactive training in lieu of in-person training where
locational or other factors rendering in-person training less feasible did not exist. The Commission has reviewed
this issue and believes that the previously required representations may be difficult to interpret and may prevent
the most economic means of compliance for firms with multiple, dispersed branches. Given the numbers of registrants,
it may also be more efficient and cost-effective to permit greater use of videotaped and interactive training, without
sacrificing the usefulness of such training, subject to the verification procedures described below. Accordingly,
the Commission is now of the view that any registrant may meet his ethics training requirement through in-person or
through videotaped or electronic presentations.

The Commission also wishes to make clear, however, that if videotaped or electronic training is offered, the provider
must be able to verify that the video has been viewed or the training completed by the registrant before the provider
issues a certificate of attendance to the registrant. Accordingly, if a provider will conduct training via videotape
or electronic presentation, either exclusively or in addition to in-person training, the Commission is proposing
that the provider's certification referred to above be supplemented to include a representation that the provider
will maintain documentation reasonably designed to verify that registrants have properly completed ethics training
for the minimum time required (one, two or four hours). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission envisages that an appropriate verification regime for a provider would include procedures such as
the following. The provider would maintain a list of the computer-based ethics program purchasers and match each
completed program with a record of purchase. Registrants would be required to enter identifying information, such
as name, firm's name, business address, telephone number, date of birth, NFA and/or Social Security number, on the
control diskette and return a signed statement with the completed computer diskette certifying that he did in fact
complete the ethics training course in the manner set out in the instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the fulfillment of the minimum time requirements and verification of the registrants' participation
in the program, the ethics training provider could use a computer-based test to assure that the registrant has attained
a minimum level of understanding of the materials covered, drawing upon matters covered in video and written materials,
as well as the computer program, to the extent applicable. Registrants would be required to pass each section of the
test prior to answering questions in later sections of the test to assure that each section of the program is completed.
While those who fail the test would be required to retake it until it is successfully completed, only the time spent
on the first test could be credited toward the ethics training time required by Rule 3.34. Registrants answering quickly
would be given additional questions to answer, and the program would cease recording elapsed time for those slow to
answer questions. Thus, registrants would be monitored both as to time spent and material covered.

If an ethics training provider develops a computer-based ethics training program for use by a particular registered
firm and its APs that in addition to the required subject matter also includes material tailored to that firm, such
as the firm's specific professional conduct policies, the ethics training provider could verify completion by the
APs by relying on the registered firm's representation as to its APs' attendance if the firm can verify the identity
of participants through the firm's in-house computer communication system or through monitoring by the firm's supervisory
or managerial staff. The ethics training provider should require registered firms using a tailored ethics training
program to furnish periodic reports of specified identifying information for each AP accessing the training program.

The Commission contemplates that an ethics training provider would be able to document that a registrant had undertaken
various steps required for the provider to verify completion. The provider would be required under revised paragraph
(b)(4) of Rule 3.34 to keep documentation to support its determination that ethics training has been properly completed
by a registrant and to support its issuance of a certificate of attendance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 3.34(b)(4) governs recordkeeping by an ethics training provider. The Commission is proposing to add a provision
to the current recordkeeping requirements that would require providers of ethics training to furnish records of
attendees at such training to a registered futures association in such format as the registered futures association
may request. When the Commission adopted Rule 3.34, it required that providers of ethics training maintain records
of attendees at such training in accordance with Commission Rule 1.31, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for a five-year period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission also stated that it would monitor the effectiveness of the requirement for maintaining a record of
ethics training attendance and may reconsider the issue at a later date if appropriate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission understands that NFA is willing to compile information on ethics training attendance for inclusion
in the registration database and believes that ethics training providers should cooperate with NFA requests for
the information which providers are already required to maintain. This will allow for a central repository of such
information which should benefit all registrants and facilitate oversight of compliance with the ethics training
requirement. To facilitate NFA's incorporation of this data in the registration database, ethics training providers
should include appropriate identifiers of registrants, such as NFA ID number, and follow other format conventions
requested by NFA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules,
consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. The proposed rule amendments discussed herein will affect
ethics training providers, which include SROs, entities accredited to conduct continuing education programs by
a state professional licensing authority in the fields of law, finance, accounting or economics, and any other person
who complies with the requirements to be included on a list of ethics training providers. The SROs offering ethics
training to their members are the contract markets and the Commission has previously determined that contract markets
are not small entities under the RFA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As to the impact of these proposals on other providers of ethics training or persons seeking to become providers of
ethics training, the Commission believes that such impact will be minimal. The procedure for becoming an ethics training
provider would be simplified. The permissible representations by ethics training providers which the Commission
is proposing to codify are consistent with the statements set forth in Commission letters issued to date to ethics
training providers. Finally, since ethics training providers are already required to maintain records of attendees,
furnishing such information to NFA upon request should not cause an undue burden.

Therefore, the Acting Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, hereby certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that
the rules proposed herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
Commission nonetheless invites comments from any person or entity which believes that these proposed rule amendments
would have a significant impact on its operations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed regulations relating to the method of reporting for trusts which are treated as owned
by grantors or other persons under the provisions of subpart E (section 671 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter
1 of the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed regulations are intended to reduce the current filing burden on trustees,
to provide necessary information to grantors or other persons treated as the owners of trusts, to reduce any cases
of duplicate filing, and to provide more meaningful information to the IRS. The proposed regulations would affect
grantors and trustees of trusts that are treated as owned by grantors or other persons, as well as persons who are required
to file information returns with respect to payments to these trusts.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document proposes amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 671 and 6012 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code), and to the Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 6109 of
the Code. The proposed amendments are to be issued under the authority of section 7805 of the Code.

Explanation of Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
Reporting Requirements Under the Current Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In general, every fiduciary (which includes a trustee of a trust) must make a return of income on Form 1041. Under the
current regulations, items of income, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to any portion of a trust which is
treated as owned by the grantor or another person generally must be shown by the trustee on a separate statement attached
to a Form 1041, rather than on the form itself. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception applies when
the same individual is both grantor and trustee (or co-trustee) of the trust, and that individual is treated for the
taxable year as the owner of the entire trust under section 676 of the Code. The second exception applies when a husband
and wife are the grantors of certain revocable trusts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301.6109&hyph;1(a)(2) of the current Regulations on Procedure and Administration provides that a grantor
trust reporting under one of these two exceptions shall not obtain an employer identification number until such time
as the reporting exceptions no longer apply to the trust. Instead, the grantor of such a trust must furnish his or her
social security number (or, when applicable, his or her employer identification number) to payors of income, and
payors must report income as if paid to the grantor, not the trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
Reporting Requirements Under the Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulations will reduce the reporting burden on certain trustees by expanding the current exceptions
to the requirement of filing a Form 1041 to other trusts all of which are treated as owned by one or more grantors or other
persons. Thus, considerably more trustees will not be required to file a Form 1041.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations retain the general rule of the current regulations that items of income, deduction, and
credit attributable to any portion of a trust which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person must be reported
by the trustee on a separate statement attached to a Form 1041.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations, however, provide alternative methods of reporting for a trust 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, including a trust treated as owned by a person other
than an individual and a trust with a third-party trustee. Under these alternative methods, the trustee does not file
a Form 1041 with an attached statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the trust is treated as owned by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
one 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
grantor or other person, the trustee may choose between two alternative methods of reporting. The trustee must furnish
to all payors of income and proceeds during the taxable year either: (i) the name and taxpayer identification number
(TIN) of the grantor or other person, and the address of the trust; or (ii) the name, TIN, and address of the trust. If
the trust is treated as owned by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
more than one
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grantor or other person, the trustee must furnish the name, TIN, and address of the trust to all payors of income and
proceeds during the taxable year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the trustee furnishes the name and TIN of the grantor or other person and the address of the trust to all payors, the
trustee is not required to file any type of return with the IRS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the trustee furnishes the name, TIN, and address of the trust to all payors, the trustee must file with the IRS appropriate
Forms 1099 which: (1) report each type of income and each item of gross proceeds paid to the trust; (2) show the trust
as the payor; and (3) show each grantor or other person treated as an owner of the trust as the payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under all of the alternative methods of reporting, unless the trustee or co-trustee is also the only grantor or other
person treated as an owner of the trust, the trustee must furnish each grantor or other person with a statement that:
(1) shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust attributable to the grantor or other person for the
taxable year; (2) provides the grantor or other person with the information necessary to take the items into account
in computing the grantor's or other person's taxable income; and (3) states that all items of income or gross proceeds
that are required to be reported to the IRS have been included on the statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statement furnished by the trustee is not subject to the requirements set forth in Internal Revenue Service Publication
1179 (Specifications for Paper Document Reporting and Paper Substitutes for Forms 1096, 1098, 1099 Series, 5498,
and W&hyph;2G) for furnishing substitute statements to form recipients. When these proposed regulations are issued
as final, a conforming change will be made to Publication 1179.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of which TIN the trustee furnishes to payors, the payors will furnish statements to recipients to the trustee
of the trust, and not to the grantors or other persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes to the current regulations under sections 6012 and 6109 of the Code are also proposed.

Effective Date and Transition Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations are effective for taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the first calendar
year after the date of publication of the final regulations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, subject to a requirement that certain trustees file a final Form 1041 before adopting one of the alternative methods
of reporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed regulations provide that, for taxable years beginning prior to the effective date of the
proposed regulations, the IRS will not challenge the manner of reporting of certain trustees of trusts all of which
are treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons who did not report in accordance with &sect;1.671&hyph;4(a)
of the current regulations.

Special Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration for comment on their impact on small businesses.

Comments and Public Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday, September 21, 1994, at 1 p.m., in the IRS Auditorium, 7th floor,
1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond
the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts.

In the case of a trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, the trustee has the option
of reporting by one of the methods described in this paragraph (b) rather than by the method described in paragraph

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
G creates an irrevocable trust which provides that the ordinary income is to be payable to him for life and that on his
death the corpus shall be distributed to B, an unrelated person. Except for the right to receive income, G retains no
right or power which would cause him to be treated as an owner under sections 671 through 677. Under the applicable local
law, capital gains must be added to corpus. Since G has a right to receive income, he is treated as an owner of a portion
of the trust under section 677. The tax consequences of any items of capital gain of the trust are governed by the provisions
of subparts A, B, C, and D (section 641 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Because not all of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor, the trustee may not report by the methods described in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

to the trust are A ($3,200) and B ($5). The payor of the gross proceeds from the sale of B stock is S ($2,000). The B stock
was purchased by T for $1,500 on January 2, 1995, and sold by T on November 30, 1995. T furnishes the name, TIN, and address
of the trust to X, Y, Z, A, B, and S. T timely files a Form 1099&hyph;INT with the Internal Revenue Service on which T reports
interest attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,500; a Form 1099&hyph;DIV on which T reports dividends
attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $3,205; and a Form 1099&hyph;B on which T reports proceeds from the sale
of B stock attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,000. On or before the date specified in section 6034A(a),
T furnishes a statement to G which lists the following items of income and information necessary for G to take the items

of the trust to all payors pursuant to &sect;1.671- 4(b)(1)(i)(A) of this chapter, the trustee need not obtain an employer
identification number for the trust until the first taxable year of the trust in which the trust is no longer described
in &sect;1.671&hyph;4(b) of this chapter. If the trustee furnishes the name, taxpayer identification number, and
address of the trust to all payors pursuant to &sect;1.671&hyph;4 (b)(1)(i)(B) or (b)(2)(i) of this chapter, and
the trustee has not already obtained a taxpayer identification number for the trust, the trustee must obtain an employer
identification number for the trust as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any payors of income or proceeds that are required to file an information return with respect to payments of income
or proceeds to a trust must show the name and taxpayer identification number that the trustee has furnished to the payor
on the return. Regardless of whether the trustee furnishes to the payor the name and taxpayer identification number
of the grantor or other person, or the name and taxpayer identification number of the trust, the payor must furnish
a statement to recipients to the trustee of the trust, rather than to the grantor or other person. Under these circumstances,
the payor is considered to have satisfied any obligation to show the name and taxpayer identification number of the
payee on the information return and to furnish to the person whose taxpayer identification number is required to be
shown on the form a statement to recipients.

all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. EPA intends to grant final approval to the State to
operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. The State of South Dakota's application for final approval is available
for public review and comment. EPA has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient
number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing to EPA or calling the contact within 30 days
of the date of publication of this notice, EPA will hold a hearing on the date given below in the ``DATES'' section. EPA
will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition, anyone who

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state underground storage
tank programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal underground storage tank (UST) program. Program approval
is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State program: (1) is ``no less stringent'' than the Federal program in
all seven elements, and includes notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2)
provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with UST standards (Section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)).

B. State of South Dakota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of South Dakota established authority through South Dakota Codified Law 34A&hyph;2&hyph;98 and 34A&hyph;2&hyph;99
to implement an underground storage tank program. The State developed and approved rules in the Administrative Rules
of South Dakota that became effective November 30, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 9, 1992, South Dakota submitted an official application for final approval. EPA reviewed and commented on
the application and requested additional information to be included in the final application. Prior to its submission,
South Dakota provided an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage
tank program as required under &sect;281.50(b). EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application, and has tentatively
determined that the State's program meets all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final approval to South Dakota to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative determination to approve the South Dakota UST program does not extend to ``Indian Country,'' as defined
in 18 U.S.C. Section 1151, including the following ``existing or former'' Indian reservations in the State of South
Dakota:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before EPA would be able to approve the State of South Dakota UST program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the
State would have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order
for a state to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it had authority either
pursuant to explicit Congressional authorization or applicable principles of Federal Indian Law to enforce its
laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any geographical area for which it seeks program approval.
EPA has reason to believe that disagreement exists with regard to the State's jurisdiction over ``Indian Country,''
and EPA is not satisfied that South Dakota has, at this time, made the requisite showing of its authority with respect
to such lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In withholding program approval for these areas, EPA is not making a determination that the State either has adequate
jurisdiction or lacks such jurisdiction. Should the State of South Dakota choose to submit analysis with regard to
its jurisdiction over all or part of ``Indian Country'' in the State, it may do so without prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's future evaluation of whether to approve the South Dakota program for ``Indian Country,'' to include Indian
reservation lands, will be governed by EPA's judgment as to whether the State has demonstrated adequate authority
to justify such approval, based upon its understanding of the relevant principles of Federal Indian law and sound
administrative practice. The State may wish to consider EPA's discussion of the related issue of tribal jurisdiction
found in the preamble to the Indian Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 56 FR 64876, December 12, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 2, 1994, the State of South Dakota submitted to EPA an amendment to its UST program application. The amendment
requests that South Dakota UST program approval be expanded to include UST activities on non-Indian lands for the
former lands of the Yankton Sioux, Lake Traverse (Sisseton-Wahpeton) and parts of the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations.
This amendment is presently being reviewed by EPA and will be treated as a revision to the South Dakota UST program proposed
for approval today. A notice of the proposed EPA decision on this amendment will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Section 9004 of RCRA 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR 281.50(e), the Agency will accept written comments
on EPA's tentative determination until August 21, 1994. Copies of South Dakota's application are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period.
Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to South Dakota. EPA expects to
make a final decision on whether or not to approve South Dakota's program by October 20, 1994 and will give notice of
it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

EPA will coordinate the State's administration of the State program. The notice will include a summary of the reasons
for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of South Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners
and operators of underground storage tanks in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility
analysis.

This document gives notice of the proposed revision of the DOL's regulations governing administrative claims submitted
to DOL pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act
(MPCECA), and for payment of claims arising out of the operation of the Job Corps. These regulations are being revised
to reflect previous delegations of authority to the Counsel for Claims and to the Regional Solicitors and Associate
Regional Solicitors to issue determinations on claims under the statutes covered by these regulations, to clarify
the manner in which organizational units of the Department provide administrative assistance to the Office of the
Solicitor in regard to claims and litigation under these statutes and to clarify and provide further examples of the
manner in which MPCECA claims are submitted and determined. The regulations are also being amended to reflect a change
in statutory authority for payment of claims arising out of operation of the Job Corps.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) surrenders the sovereign immunity of the United States for the negligent or wrongful
act or omission of a Government employee acting within the scope of his or her employment. The Military Personnel and
Civilian Employees' Claims Act (MPCECA) authorizes payment of claims of employees of the Government for loss of,
or damage to, property incident to Government service. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) authorizes payment
of claims arising out of the operation of the Job Corps that are not cognizable under the FTCA. Part 15 of title 29 of the
Code of Federal Regulations currently contains regulations implementing these three claims authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A of part 15 sets forth regulations for claims under the FTCA. It is being revised to reflect previous delegations
of authority to the Counsel for Claims to issue determinations of claims seeking damages in amounts exceeding $25,000
and to the Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors to issue determinations of claims that arose within
their jurisdictions seeking damages in amounts up to $25,000. Subpart A is also being amended to provide that all FTCA
claims for amounts up to $25,000 should be filed with the official duty station of the employee whose act or omission
forms the basis of the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A is also being amended to clarify and provide specific directions concerning the manner in which organizational
units of the Department provide assistance to the Office of the Solicitor in regard to FTCA claims and litigation.
A number of non-substantive editorial changes are also being made to the language of these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B of part 15 sets forth regulations for claims under the MPCECA. It is being revised to reflect previous delegations
of authority to the Counsel for Claims and to the Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors. It is also
being revised to reflect an amendment to the MPCECA increasing the maximum amount payable on a claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B is being amended to clarify the manner in which claims are submitted and calculated and to provide further
illustrations of allowable claims and those not allowable under the MPCECA. Thus, provisions are being added clarifying
that both filing of a claim and determination of a claim must be in writing and that a claim is not required to contain
a demand for a specific sum of money. Each MPCECA claimant will be required to provide a statement from his or her immediate
supervisor that possession of the property in question was reasonable, useful or proper and its loss or damage was
incident to service. Additional examples of property for which reimbursement is not available are being added such
as intangible property, real property and commercial property. A provision is also being added to recognize that
claimants may be reimbursed for any sales tax incurred in connection with the repair of an item.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B is being revised to exclude payment for loss of, or damage to, cellular telephones, fax machines, computers
and related hardware and software, unless the loss is incident to fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster
or by theft from authorized quarters (as limited by &sect;15.13(c)(1)) or unless it is being shipped as part of a change
in duty station paid for by the Department. Subpart B is also being revised to provide that an alternative work location
at which an employee is performing duties pursuant to an approved Flexiplace agreement shall be considered an official
duty station for purposes of this subtitle. The minimum amount of loss necessary to have a claim allowed is being raised
from $10 to $25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B is also being amended to provide that at the discretion of the official involved, a claimant may be required
to turn over to the United States an item alleged to have been damaged beyond economical repair and to provide that current
replacement cost and depreciated value are to be determined by use of publicly available adjustment rates or through
use of other reasonable methods at the discretion of the deciding official. A number of non-substantive editorial
changes are also being made to the language of subpart B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Subpart C is being revised to reflect a change in the statutory authority for claims arising out of the operation of
the Job Corps from the Comprehensive Training and Employment Act of 1973 to the JTPA. It also is being revised to reflect
previous delegations of authority to the Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors and to clarify the
manner in which a claim is submitted. Subpart C is also being revised to provide that the determination of a claim shall
be provided to the claimant in writing. A number of non-substantive editorial changes are also being made to the language
of subpart C.

Damage to real property is not compensable. In determining whether an item is considered to be an item of personal property,
as opposed to real property, normally, any movable item is considered personal property even if physically joined

Claims involving carriers or insurers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event the property which is the subject of the claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a commercial
carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the
owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled
the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the
terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Whenever property is damaged, lost or destroyed incident to the claimant's service and is insured in whole or in
part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under the terms and conditions
of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the claim against the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights
available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result
in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from
the carrier or insurer had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where
the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution,
or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit his
claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final
approval or denial of the claim is made by the carrier or insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Upon submitting his or her claim, the claimant shall certify in his claim that he or she has or has not gained any recovery
from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If final action has not been taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim, the claimant shall immediately notify
them to address all correspondence in regard to the claim to the appropriate Office of the Solicitor of Labor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claimant shall advise the appropriate Office of the Solicitor of any action taken by the carrier or insurer
on the claim and, upon request, shall furnish all correspondence, documents, and other evidence pertinent to the
matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The claimant shall assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment on the claim accepted by him or her, all
rights, title and interest in any claim he or she may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of
the incident on which the claim against the United States is based. After payment of the claim by the United States,
the claimant shall, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the
extent of the payment received by him or her from the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Where a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before his or her claim under this subpart is settled,
the amount or recovery shall be applied to the claim as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's
total loss as determined under this part, no compensation is allowable under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery
from the amount of such total loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For this purpose, the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the maximum payment limitations
set forth in &sect;15.11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds the maximum payment limitations, the claimant
shall be allowed only the maximum amount set forth in &sect;15.11.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes changes to the systems and equipment airworthiness standards for normal, utility, acrobatic,
and commuter category airplanes. These proposals arise from the joint effort of the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) to harmonize the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and
the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) for airplanes that will be certificated in these categories. The proposed
changes would provide nearly uniform systems and equipment airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated
in the United States under 14 CFR part 23 (part 23) and in the JAA countries under Joint Aviation Requirements 23 (JAR
23), thereby simplifying airworthiness approval for import and export purposes.

Background

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At the June 1990 meeting of the JAA Council (consisting of JAA members from European countries) and the FAA, the FAA
Administrator committed the FAA to support the harmonization of the FAR with the JAR being developed for use by the
European authorities who are members of the JAA. In response to this commitment, the FAA Small Airplane Directorate
established an FAA Harmonization Task Force to work with the JAR 23 Study Group to harmonize part 23 and the proposed
JAR 23. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) also established a JAR 23/part 23 Committee to provide
technical assistance in this effort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the first draft of proposed JAR 23, members of the FAA Harmonization Task Force and the GAMA Committee
met in Brussels, Belgium for the October 1990 meeting of the JAR 23 Study Group. Representatives from the Association
Europeene des Constructeures de Material Aerospatial (AECMA), an organization of European airframe manufacturers,
also attended. The main agenda item for this meeting was the establishment of procedures to accomplish harmonization
of the airworthiness standards for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes. The JAA had decided that its
initial rulemaking effort should be limited to these three categories and that commuter category airworthiness
standards should be addressed separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After that meeting, technical representatives from each of the four organizations (GAMA, AECMA, FAA and JAA) met
to resolve differences between the proposed JAR and part 23. This portion of the harmonization effort involved a number
of separate meetings of specialists in the flight, airframe, powerplant, and systems disciplines. These meetings
showed that harmonization would require revisions to both part 23 and the proposed JAR 23.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Near the end of the effort to harmonize the normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplane airworthiness standards,
the JAA requested and received recommendations from its member countries on proposed airworthiness standards for
commuter category airplanes. The JAA and the FAA held specialist and study group meetings to discuss these recommendations,
which resulted in proposals to revise portions of the part 23 commuter category airworthiness standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the European rules, where commuter category airworthiness standards are separate, for U.S. rulemaking,
it is advantageous to adopt normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airworthiness standards simultaneously,
since commuter category airworthiness standards are already contained in part 23. Accordingly, this NPRM proposes
to revise the systems and equipment airworthiness standards for all part 23 airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the part 23 harmonization effort, the FAA established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991), which held its first meeting on May 23, 1991. The ARAC on General Aviation and Business Airplane
(GABA) Issues was established at that meeting to provide advice and recommendations to the Director, Aircraft Certification
Service, FAA, regarding the airworthiness standards in part 23 as well as related provisions of parts 91 and 135 of
the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA announced, on June 2&hyph;5, 1992, at the JAA/FAA Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the JAR and the FAR. Coinciding
with that announcement, the FAA assigned the ARAC on GABA Issues those rulemaking projects related to JAR/part 23
harmonization that were in final coordination between the JAA and the FAA. The harmonization process included the
intention to present the results of JAA/FAA coordination to the public as NPRM's. Subsequently, the ARAC on GABA Issues
established an ARAC&hyph;JAR 23 Study Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JAR 23 Study Group made recommendations to the ARAC on GABA Issues concerning the FAA disposition of the rulemaking
issues coordinated between the JAA and the FAA. The draft NPRMs previously prepared by the FAA harmonization team
were made available to the harmonization working group to assist them in their effort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of the formation of the JAR 23 Harmonization Working Group was published on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56626).
The group held its first meeting on February 2, 1993. These efforts resulted in the proposals for systems and equipment
airworthiness standards contained in this notice. The ARAC on GABA Issues agreed with these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received unsolicited comments from the JAA dated January 20, 1994, concerning issues that were left unresolved
with the JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group did not address some of the unresolved issues
because the JAA had not yet reached positions on those issues. Unresolved issues will be dealt with at future FAR/JAR
Harmonization meetings. With respect to other issues unresolved by the JAR 23 Study Group, the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization
Working Group recommendations did not reflect harmonization, but reflected the technical discussion of the merits
of each issue that had been thoroughly debated at the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization meetings. (The Working Group Chairperson
had been present at the Harmonization meetings.) The JAA comments have been placed in the docket for this proposal,
and will be considered along with those received during the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following completion of these harmonization efforts, the FAA determined that the proposed revisions to part 23 were
too numerous for a single NPRM. The FAA decided to simplify the issues by issuing four NPRM's. These NPRM's address
the airworthiness standards in the specific areas of systems and equipment, powerplant, flight, and airframe. These
NPRM's propose changes in all seven subparts of part 23. Since there is some overlap, interested persons are advised
to review all four NPRM's to identify all proposed changes to a particular section.

Discussion of Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.677&blank;Trim Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed revised &sect;23.677(a) would clarify the need to mark the lateral and directional trim indicators with
the neutral trim position. Since trim indicators on most airplanes are currently marked with the neutral position
of the trimming device, this proposal would standardize the cockpit markings for all airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised paragraph (a) would also add a requirement for the pitch trim indicator to be marked with the proper pitch trim
range for the takeoff of the airplane. Some takeoff accidents, including some involving fatalities, have occurred
because the pitch trim was not set to the proper range needed for the airplane takeoff. Because of this accident experience,
most of the current airplane manufacturers mark the pitch trim indicator with the pitch trim range for takeoff. Therefore,
the proposed marking requirement would not have a significant impact on future airplane designs and would ensure
that the markings needed for a safe takeoff are provided for the pilots' use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.691&blank;Artificial Stall Barrier System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed new section would provide standards for stall barrier systems if a stall barrier is necessary to show
compliance with &sect;23.201(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of &sect;23.201(c) provide criteria for the in-flight demonstration of wings level stall. The
requirements also specify the means of identifying when a stall has occurred. Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 (58 FR 42136,
August 6, 1993) revised &sect;23.201(c) by adding the activation of an artificial stall barrier as an acceptable
means of identifying when a stall has occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the technology of airplane designs improved and engines with increased power became available, airplanes were
developed that did not meet the older wings level stall requirement of &sect;23.201. Consequently, these airplanes
were equipped with an artificial stall barrier that moved the airplane elevator controls and caused a nose down pitching
motion similar to the pitching motion of airplanes that meet the wings level stall requirement of &sect;23.201. The
manufacturer selected the airspeed where this pitching motion occurred and flight testing established compliance
with the other flight regulations at airspeeds above the speed selected for the push. These stall barrier systems
are commonly called ``stick pushers.'' Such systems have been accepted for compliance with &sect;23.201 under the
equivalent safety provisions of &sect;21.21(b)(1), since they provide a pitch motion that is equivalent to that
experienced during stalls of airplanes that meet the stall requirements of &sect;23.201. Appropriate compliance
with other applicable requirements of part 23 has been established by other design characteristics of the stall barrier
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of the proposed new section are based on system design characteristics necessary to ensure the safe
operation of previously approved stall barrier systems. The proposed section also requires such systems to include
provisions to prevent unwanted activation of the stall barrier systems. This is necessary to ensure that such systems
do not cause downward pitching motions at higher airspeeds when such pitching could be unsafe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed sections would basically codify those provisions that have been found necessary for approving stick
pusher systems under the equivalent safety requirements of &sect;21.21(b)(1). Therefore, in effect, no new requirements
would be added by this proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new section would be applicable only to airplanes with flight characteristics that need an artificial
stall barrier system to ensure safe operation of that airplane. Including provision for the installation of an optional
stick pusher system would relieve the manufacturer of the financial burden that would be needed to redesign the airplane
so that it would meet the wings level stall requirements.

Section 23.697&blank;Wing Flap Controls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.697(c) would provide safety standards for the wing flap control lever designs installed in
airplanes that use wing flap settings other than fully retracted when showing compliance with &sect;23.145. This
revision is needed to ensure that the flap settings, which establish the safe operation of the airplane, can be positively
selected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to clarify the requirements for flap systems installed on part 23
airplanes. Following the revision of &sect;23.701, as adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;42 (56 FR 353, January 3,
1991), the FAA discovered that the new requirements could be interpreted in a way that was not intended and that this
interpretation could result in approval of airplanes with unsafe flight characteristics in the event of flap failure.
To clarify the intent of the requirements, the FAA issued on March 14, 1991, a policy letter to all aircraft certification
offices that provided guidance for the correct application of the requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since then, the FAA has reexamined the requirements and determined that &sect;23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) need to be
revised to ensure that a failure of the flap system would not create an asymmetric flap configuration that could result
in an unsafe flight condition. Therefore, &sect;23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to clarify that one of the
following would apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The moveable flap surfaces must be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection or by an approved equivalent
means, that is independent of the flap drive system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The wing flap system must be designed so that any failures of the flap system that would result in an unsafe flight
characteristic of the airplane, such as flap asymmetry, is extremely improbable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revisions would ensure that a failure of the flap drive systems will not result in a flap asymmetry configuration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 23.703&blank;Takeoff Warning System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed new section would require a takeoff warning system on some commuter category airplanes. The requirement
would be applicable if the flight evaluation showed that an unsafe takeoff condition would result if lift devices
or longitudinal trim devices are set to any position outside the approved takeoff range. If the evaluation shows that
no unsafe condition would result at any setting of these devices, a takeoff warning system would not be required. For
those airplanes on which a warning system must be installed, the proposal would provide requirements for the installation
of the system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Paragraph (b) of this section would be revised by changing the word ``reserved'' in the phrase ``reserved energy absorption
capacity'' to ``reserve.''

Section 23.729&blank;Landing Gear Extension and Retraction System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.729(e) to clarify that a landing gear indicator is required for each gear. The
last sentence of current &sect;23.729(e) would also be removed. This sentence, which states that the switches may
be located where they are operated by the actual landing gear locking latch or device, is advisory material and should
not be included in the requirements. If future guidance is needed to identify acceptable switch locations, Advisory
Circular 23.701&hyph;1 will be revised to include that information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would also add a new &sect;23.729(g) requiring that if the landing gear bay is used as the location for
equipment other than landing gear, the equipment must be designed and installed to minimize damage. On larger airplanes,
such as the commuter category, a primary cause of damage to such equipment would be tire burst. In addition, service
history has shown that rocks, water, and slush enter the landing gear bay and cause damage. The equipment on any size
airplane should be protected from damage by such external sources.

Section 23.735&blank;Brakes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.735(a) would be revised to state plainly that wheel brakes must be provided. A proposed new &sect;23.735(c)
would require the brake system to be designed so that the brake manufacturer's specified brake pressures are not exceeded
during the landing distance determination required by &sect;23.75.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.735(e), applicable to commuter category airplanes, would require establishing the minimum
rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly. Section 23.45 provides
that the determination of the accelerate-stop distance for commuter category airplanes be made in accordance with
the applicant's procedures for operation in service. The proposed requirement is needed to ensure that the brakes
will perform safely under accelerate-stop conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.745 would provide requirements that apply if nose/tail-wheel steering is installed. Advanced
airplane design technology, along with the need to safely control the airplane when it is being operated on increasingly
congested airports, has resulted in several small airplanes being equipped with systems for ground steering only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new section would not require the installation of a system for ground steering, but it would add requirements
to define how such a system should function if one is installed. It would also require the steering system to be designed
so that it will not interfere with any installed landing gear retraction and extension system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.775(a) would be revised to state that internal glass panels of windshields and windows must be constructed
of a nonsplintering material, such as nonsplintering glass. Currently &sect;23.775(a) requires nonsplintering
safety glass only. A nonsplintering material must be used to protect pilots from injury. While nonsplintering glass
is an acceptable standard, other nonsplintering materials would be allowed under the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.775(c) would be revised to clarify that it applies to pressurized airplanes if certification for operation
up to and including 25,000 feet is requested. This would not be a substantive change. It has always applied to such airplanes
but is not as directly stated in the current rule as it would be in the proposed rule. Current &sect;23.775(e), which
is being redesignated as &sect;23.775(d) by this notice without change, provides requirements for airplanes that
are certified for operations above 25,000 feet. This revision of paragraph (c) and redesignation of paragraph (e)
will clarify the requirements that are applicable to airplanes approved for operations at different altitudes.
Redesignated paragraph (e) is revised to remove the masculine gender by rephrasing ``when he is seated'' to read ``when
the pilot is seated.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.775(h), introductory text, and paragraph (h)(1) would be added to require windshield panes of commuter
category airplanes that are directly in front of the pilots to withstand the impact of a two pound bird. This requirement
is based on a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation to add windshield bird strike protection for commuter category
airplanes. Following receipt of the recommendations, the FAA obtained and reviewed the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) data on bird strikes that occurred on airplanes of 19,000 pounds or less from 1981 through 1989.
These data show that approximately 550 strikes occurred and that one out of seven strikes hit the windshield. The bird
strike reports, which include information on the type of bird, the airplane altitude and/or airspeed, show the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. More than one-half of the strikes (51.8 percent) occurred between the ground and 100 feet above the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Another one-fourth of the strikes (26.7 percent) occurred between 101 and 1000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The airplane airspeed at the time of most of the strikes (85 percent) was 150 knots or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Where bird types were reported, 27.6 percent involved small birds and 58.6 involved medium size birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Incidents where the airplane was damaged showed that 16.9 percent resulted from small bird strikes and 64 percent
resulted from strikes involving medium size birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation of these data indicate that most bird strikes occur at takeoff and landing altitudes and airspeeds, and
that medium or small birds, many weighing two pounds or less, are most often struck. Although only a few fatalities
and injuries have resulted from these reported bird strikes, the data indicates a high probability of bird strikes
during landings and takeoffs and the potential hazards of such strikes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed new paragraph would require that the windshield panes directly in front of the pilots of commuter category
airplanes, and the supportive structure for these panes, must withstand the impact of a two-pound bird at an airplane's
maximum approach flap speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.775(h)(2) would require the panels of the windshield to be arranged so that, if one is damaged,
other panels will remain that will provide visibility for continuous safe flight and landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By requiring full protection against the strike of a two-pound bird at approach speeds, some protection will also
be provided if the airplane strikes a larger bird or strikes a bird at a higher speed.

potential hazard that could endanger persons using the door. The propeller disk remains the prominent hazard but
other items, such as hot deicer surfaces or sharp objects on the airplane structure, are also hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.787 would be revised by extending the present requirements for cargo compartments to baggage compartments.
As proposed, future baggage compartments on all airplane categories would be required to: Be placarded for their
maximum weight capacity; have a means to prevent the baggage from shifting; and have a means to protect controls, wiring,
lines, and equipment or accessories that are located in the compartment and whose damage or failure would affect safe
operation of the airplane. These standards have been applicable to cargo compartment designs for some time and should
be applied to baggage compartments since the same safety factors are involved. Because manufacturers recognize
the need for these standards, many of these provisions have been included in the current design of baggage compartments
and, therefore, the proposed requirements are not expected to create a significant burden. With this revision the
commuter category requirements of &sect;23.787(g) would be redundant and that requirement is being removed.

This proposed new section would require at least one illuminated sign notifying all passengers when seat belts should
be fastened. This proposed requirement applies to airplanes where flightcrew members cannot observe occupant seats
or where the flightcrew member compartment is separated from the passenger compartment. When illuminated, the signs
must be legible to all persons seated in the passenger compartment. Each sign must be installed so that a flightcrew
member can turn it on and off from his or her station.

The proposed revision of &sect;23.807(b) would provide that the inside handles of emergency exits that open outward
must be protected against inadvertent operation. Currently this protection is required by applying the general
safety provisions of this subchapter. The addition of the specific requirement in &sect;23.807(b) would clarify
the need for this protection by providing a requirement that addresses outward opening emergency exits.

The proposed revision to &sect;23.807(b)(5) and new &sect;23.807(b)(6) would apply to acrobatic and utility category

for these category airplanes allow the occupants to abandon the airplane at certain speeds related to such maneuvers.
These emergency exits need to function under different environmental conditions than the emergency exits on normal
category airplanes. The revision of the text in paragraph (b)(5) would provide the same terminology that is used in
added new paragraph (b)(6).

The proposed revision to &sect;23.841(a) would extend the cabin pressure requirements of current paragraph (a),
which now apply to airplanes certificated for operation above 31,000 feet, to airplanes certificated for over 25,000
feet. Current 14 CFR part 25, JAR 25, and proposed JAR 23 include the same requirement as this proposal. This proposed
requirement is intended to protect the airplane occupants from harm if a malfunction occurs at altitudes where symptoms
of hypoxia occur, usually above 25,000 feet. Due to the increasing use of turbine powered engines, more part 23 airplanes
will be approved for operations above 25,000 feet, thus exposing an increasing number or occupants, who may have some
breathing difficulties, to these altitudes. The occupants should have the same protection provided by the airworthiness
standards of part 25 and JAR 25.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed paragraph (b) would require cargo and baggage compartments to be constructed of materials that meet the
appropriate provisions of &sect;23.853(d)(3). Currently these requirements apply to commuter category airplanes
and to the materials used in the compartments of these airplanes. The proposed new requirement would expand this applicability
to the cargo and baggage compartments of all part 23 airplanes. In effect, the proposed new requirement would require
materials that are self-extinguishing rather than flame resistant as currently required under &sect;23.787(d).

Proposed new paragraph (c) would add new fire protection requirements for cargo and baggage compartments for commuter
category airplanes. The proposed rule would require on of the following alternatives: (1) Either the compartment
must be located where pilots seated at their duty station would easily discover the fire or the compartment must be
equipped with a smoke or fire detector system to warn the pilot's station. The compartment must also provide access
to the compartment with a fire extinguisher. (2) The compartment may be inaccessible, but must be equipped with a fire
detector system that warns the pilot station, and the compartment must have ceiling and sidewall floor panels constructed
of materials that have been subjected to and meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F of this part.
(3) The compartment must be constructed and sealed to contain any fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new section is necessary for several reasons. The proposals for additional requirements for commuter
category airplane cargo and baggage compartments were developed after an examination of reported incidents of inflight
fires and their causes. Although most of these incidents of inflight fires occurred on transport category airplanes,
the reported sources of the fires showed that the fires originate from sources, such as matches in the pockets of clothing,
that are as likely to be found on part 23 airplanes as on transport category airplanes. The same potential for inflight
fires exists on commuter category airplanes and adequate protection should be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for inflight fires also showed a need to examine the flame resistant requirements of current &sect;23.787(d)
and to consider requirements that would improve the fire protection on other categories of airplanes. As a part of
this consideration, fire protection was discussed with certain airframe manufacturing representatives. Information
provided in these discussions showed that materials that meet self-extinguishing flame requirements are available
at about the same cost as materials that meet flame resistance requirements. Based on a review of the fire incidents
and the information on availability of improved materials, the proposal for &sect;23.855(b), which would replace
current &sect;23.787(d), would require self-extinguishing materials to be used in the cargo and baggage compartments
of all part 23 airplanes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The lead in for &sect;23.1303(a) would be revised to clarify that the instruments required by this section are the
minimum ones required. Also, &sect;23.1303(d) would add a requirement for those airplanes whose performance must
be based on weight, altitude, and temperature to be equipped with a free air temperature indicator. A new sentence
added to &sect;23.1303(e)(2) would state that nuisance overspeed warnings should not occur at lower speeds where
pilots might ignore the warning. A new paragraph (f) would propose requirements for attitude instruments that include
a means for flightcrew members to adjust the reference symbol. Finally, it would add a new paragraph (g) to define certain
specific instruments required for a commuter category airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal for &sect;23.1303(e)(2) was developed following a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation that the
warning should not occur below the maximum operating limit speed (V

These manufacturers responded that it would be possible to establish a lower limit at V

, but that the design changes needed to ensure that the warning occurred between the presently required upper limit
and the recommended lower limit would be very expensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA notes that no known safety problem justifies that cost of these design changes. However, the FAA is also aware
that if warnings of any type occur when the pilots know that no particular problem exists, such warnings may become
a nuisance. If warnings become a nuisance, a pilot may disregard a warning when the airplane is approaching a flight
speed where an unsafe flight condition may occur. Regulatory action is therefore needed to ensure that the warning
will occur within appropriate speed limits. Proposed &sect;23.1303(e)(2) would require manufacturers to establish
a lower speed limit so that nuisance overspeed warnings will not occur. The manufacturer would be required to show
that this limit is appropriate for the airplane design but would not be required to set this lower limit at one specific
speed, such as V

A new &sect;23.1303(f) is proposed because attitude instruments are available that provide a means accessible to
the flightcrew members, for adjusting the reference symbol through ranges that could result in unsafe pitch angles
in small airplanes. These instruments were developed for airplanes that use high pitch angles for approved climb
or descent gradients. By permitting these airplanes to use instruments that can be adjusted for these higher pitch
angles, pilots are able to maintain the design gradients using an instrument that provides a normal indication at
that pitch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such attitude instruments are installed in small airplanes, pilots could adjust the reference symbol to ranges
that could result in unsafe pitch angles. The recommendation showed that some instruments can be adjusted to result
in pitch angles that are nearly the same as the pitch angle that many small airplanes achieve before stalling. To preclude
potential cases of unwanted pitch adjustments of attitude instruments installed in small airplanes, &sect;23.1303(f)
proposes to limit the adjustment range to that limit that is needed for parallax correction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1303(g) would identify specific instruments, and limits of those instruments, required
for commuter category airplanes. When the JAA initiated their consideration of commuter category airplanes, one
of the proposals they received recommended adding the instrument requirements of &sect;25.1303 to part 23 for commuter
category airplanes. In considering this recommendation, a review of the requirements showed that many instruments
required under &sect;25.1303 are presently required by the operating rules. In addition, &sect;23.1583(h) requires
a list of the equipment that must be installed for the kinds of operation for which the airplane is approved. Based on
the review, it was determined that many of the requirements in &sect;25.1303 would be redundant, and the recommendation
was not accepted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering a portion of the recommendation to require a third attitude instrument, the FAA noted that &sect;91.531(a)(3)
requires a commuter category airplane of ten or more passengers to be operated with a second-in-command and that &sect;23.1321
requires flight and navigation instruments for each required pilot. Accordingly, two attitude instruments are
required for a ten passenger, IFR approved commuter category airplane. Service experience has shown that failures
of an attitude instrument system can occur where there will be a time period in which the indicator appears to be working
but is providing incorrect information. During such a failure of one instrument in an airplane equipped with only
two instruments, the pilots may have difficulty determining which instrument to follow, and hazardous flight attitudes
may result. A third attitude instrument would allow the crew to retain reliable attitude information at all times,
and thus the proposed rule would require a third attitude instrument for commuter airplanes operated by two pilots.

a portion of &sect;23.1309(d) and read: ``In addition, for commuter category airplanes, system and installations
must be designed to safeguard against hazards to the airplane in the event of their malfunction or failure.'' (52 FR
1833, January 15, 1987.) To correct this oversight, and to continue the single fault provision of this paragraph,

This proposal would revise &sect;23.1311 to remove redundant requirements and to clarify which secondary instruments
are required and the visibility requirements for these instruments. When &sect;23.1311 was adopted by Amendment
No. 23&hyph;41 (55 FR 43306, October 26, 1990), several nonsubstantive changes were made to the proposals in Notice
No. 89&hyph;6 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) to remove the redundancy included in the notice. In the process certain provisions,
such as the one that permitted the installation of mechanical secondary instruments, were inadvertently omitted
from the final rule. Since the final rule, discussions with airplane manufacturer representatives have shown that
the requirements defining the instrument panel location where secondary instruments may be installed are also not
clear. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing to revise this section to correct and clarify these portions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1311(a), which requires electronic display indicator installations that are independent to
each pilot station, would be deleted because it is redundant with &sect;23.1321(a). Section 23.1321(a) requires
that each flight, navigation, and powerplant instrument for use by any required pilot shall be located so that any
pilot seated at the controls can monitor the instruments with minimum head and eye movement. As stated in the preamble
of Notice No. 89&hyph;6 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) regarding the proposed revision to &sect;23.1321, ``This revision
also clarifies the rule relative to instrumentation that must be provided for each pilot required for type certification
or by the applicable operating rules. If a pilot is required by any applicable requirement, then that pilot must be
provided all instrumentation required for any operations for which the airplane is approved.'' Accordingly, the
requirements of current &sect;23.1311(a) would be removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In place of current paragraph (a), proposed &sect;23.1311(a) would be a revision of current paragraph (c) that would
clarify what instruments are required and the visibility of those instruments. Proposed new &sect;23.1311(a)(1)
would require electronic display instrument installations to meet the arrangement and visibility requirements
of &sect;23.1321(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1311(a) (2), (3), and (4) would be redesignated with no changes from current &sect;23.1311(c)
(1), (2), and (3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) would continue the requirement of &sect;23.1303(c) for a magnetic direction indicator
and, in addition, would require either an independent secondary mechanical altimeter, airspeed indicator, and
attitude indicator or individual electronic display indicators for the altimeter, airspeed, and attitude that
are independent from the airplane's primary electrical power. These secondary instruments may be installed in panel
positions other than the primary location as long as the selected location allows the pilot to properly monitor the
instruments and control the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substance of proposed paragraph (a)(5) is both a substantive change and a combination of the current &sect;23.1311(b),
which states that certain electronic display indicators must be independent of the airplane's electrical power
system, and current &sect;23.1311(c)(4) which requires independent secondary attitude and rate-of-turn instruments
and specifies the location of those instruments. Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) would delete the requirement for
a rate-of-turn instrument (in current &sect;23.1311(c)(4)) and specify that the required secondary instruments
are those that provide altitude, airspeed, magnetic direction, and attitude. The information that would be provided
by a secondary rate-of-turn instrument would not appreciably add to the safe operations of the airplane if the pilot
has the information provided by the secondary attitude instrument.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1311(b) requires that electronic display indicators required by &sect;23.1303 (a), (b), and
(c) be independent of the airplane's electrical power system. The original intent of the requirement for secondary
instruments, as stated in Notice No. 89&hyph;6, was to require the installation of either mechanical instruments
or independent electronic display indicators powered by a source independent of the airplane's electrical system.
However, the current rule does not clearly state this and does not address the installation of mechanical instruments.
Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5), would allow either secondary electronic display indicators or mechanical instruments
to provide a crew with information essential for continued flight and landing in the event of failure in the airplane's
electrical power system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed new &sect;23.1323(c) would add a requirement that each airspeed indicating system design and installation
should provide positive drainage of moisture from the system. This proposal is consistent with the provisions required
for a static system by &sect;23.1325(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If moisture enters, or accumulates in, an airspeed indicating system, that moisture could cause erroneous airspeed
indications or the complete loss of airspeed information. The resulting loss of accurate airspeed information would
be hazardous to the operation of the airplane; therefore, to assure the safety of the airplane, the FAA would need to
apply the more general airworthiness requirements of &sect;&sect;23.1301 and 23.1309 to such a system and require
provisions for drainage of moisture. Accordingly, this proposed revision of the airspeed indicating systems requirements
only clarifies the criteria that must be applied to airspeed indicating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To better organize the requirements that are applicable to the airspeed systems on all airplane categories and those
that would be additional requirements for the airspeed systems of commuter category airplanes, the FAA proposes
to redesignate existing paragraphs (c) and (e), respectively, as paragraphs (e) and (d). By this redesignation,
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) would apply to all airplanes, and paragraphs (e) and (f) would include additional
requirements applicable to commuter category airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal for redesignated paragraph (e) would also remove the words ``in flight and'' from the first sentence
of that paragraph. This would remove the requirement for the airspeed indicating system to be calibrated in flight.
The requirement for an in flight calibration is provided in paragraph (b). Proposed redesignated paragraph (e) would
apply to the calibration needed to determine the system error during the accelerate-takeoff ground run.

As identified in the background section of this notice, the FAA is issuing additional notices that address proposed
changes to the requirements for powerplant, flight, and airframe. Proposed revisions to subpart G in the flight NPRM
include placing all of the requirements for what must appear in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) in that subpart. With
the proposals to revise the AFM requirements, the flight NPRM also proposes that the requirement in existing &sect;23.1323(d)
(to show the relationship between IAS and CAS in the AFM) be added to &sect;23.1587 as proposed new paragraph (d)(10).
Because the AFM requirement would be added to &sect;23.1587, it no longer needs to appear in &sect;23.1323. Accordingly,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1323(f) would provide that, on those commuter airplanes where duplicate airspeed indicators
are required, the airspeed pitot tubes must be located far enough apart so that both tubes will not be damaged by a single
bird strike.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;23.1325(b)(3) establishes certain static pressure system requirements for airplanes that encounter
icy conditions. Current &sect;23.1325(g) exempts from the requirements of (b)(3) airplanes that are prohibited
from flight in instrument meteorological conditions in accordance with &sect;23.1559(b). After the adoption of
&sect;23.1325(g), it came to the FAA's attention that there are conditions other than instrument meteorological
conditions where icing may be encountered and, therefore, that this paragraph should also exempt from the provisions
of &sect;23.1325(b)(3) airplanes that are prohibited from flight in icing conditions. Accordingly, &sect;23.1325(g)
would be revised to read, ``For airplanes prohibited from flight in instrument meteorological or icing conditions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the background section of this notice, the FAA will issue additional notices that will address proposed
changes to the requirements for powerplant, flight, and airframe. Revisions to Subpart G in the flight notice will
propose to place all of the requirements that specify what must appear in the AFM in that subpart. With the proposals
to revise the AFM requirements, the flight notice will also propose that &sect;23.1325(f) be removed and the results
of the altimeter system calibration would be required by &sect;23.1587.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1326 would require the installation of a pitot tube heat indicating system on those airplanes
required to be equipped with a heated pitot tube. Heated pitot tubes ensure that moisture will not freeze in the tube
and block or partially block the airspeed indicating system. Such blockage would result in the pilots receiving incorrect
flight data with possibly disastrous results.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to advancements in technology, many part 23 airplane installations now utilize equipment whose data sources
are critical to the accurate and dependable operation of that equipment. The heated pitot tube is one such data source.
The pitot heat indicating system will advise the pilots of any inoperative heating element in the pitot tube and that
subsequent inaccuracies may result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 23 airplanes certificated for flight under instrument flight rules or for flight in icing conditions are required
by current &sect;23.1323(e) to have a heated pitot system or an equivalent means of preventing an airspeed indicating
system malfunction due to ice accumulation. This proposal would require such airplanes equipped with a heated pitot
tube to be equipped with a pitot tube heat indicating system. This requirement will provide greater assurance that
the pilots will not be dangerously misled by faulty flight instrument indications caused by pitot tube icing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When pitot tube heat indicating system requirements were added to part 25, the FAA noted the occurrence of at least
one accident and several incidents in which an airspeed indicating error occurred that might have been avoided if
a pitot tube heat indicating system had been installed. Part 23 airplanes operate at lower airspeeds and over shorter
distances that do part 25 airplanes; therefore, their exposure to moisture and temperature conditions where icing
may occur is higher than it is for transport category airplanes. Because of this environmental exposure, the potential
for an inoperative heated pitot tube becoming a hazard to part 23 airplanes is greater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed requirement also responds to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation A&hyph;92&hyph;85,
which recommends requiring a modification to certain part 23 airplanes to provide for a pitot heat operating light
similar to the light required by &sect;25.1326 for transport category airplanes. NTSB issued the safety recommendation,
among others, as a result of a special investigation and analysis of a series of fatal accidents that occurred from
May 31, 1989, through March 17, 1991.

New &sect;23.1329(b), adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;24 (58 FR 18958, April 9, 1993), does not state clearly that
stick controlled airplanes must be equipped with the same autopilot quick release controls that are required for
airplanes with control wheels. This proposed revision of &sect;23.1329(b) would clarify that a quick release control
must be installed on each control stick of an airplane that can be operated from either pilot seat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise the heading of this section to reflect the powerplant instrument installation requirements
that it contains. The difference between this section and &sect;23.1305 is clarified by this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.1337(b) would be revised by removing the wording that authorizes installation of only those fuel indicators
marked in gallons and pounds. In countries that use the metric system, other acceptable units of measure for marking
fuel indicators are used. This proposed revision would allow the use of any appropriate measurement unit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23.1337(b) would also be revised by adding the word ``usable'' to the first sentence of this section. This
revision is consistent with the requirements of &sect;23.1337(b)(1), which requires the fuel quantity indicator
to be calibrated to read ``zero'' when the fuel in the tank is equal to the unusable fuel determined under &sect;23.959.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1337(b)(4) would require a ``means to indicate'' the amount of usable fuel in each tank when
the airplane is on the ground. This requirement would ensure that a reliable means is provided for the pilot to determine
before takeoff that the amount of fuel that is in the airplane is adequate for the intended flight. The ability to make
this preflight determination will help reduce the number of accidents that have resulted from fuel starvation. This
proposal, which is patterned after &sect;23.1337 (d) and (d)(1), would not require a separate fuel indicating system.
The means to determine the amount of fuel while on the ground may be provided by a calibrated dipstick, separate markings
on the inflight fuel indicator, or any other acceptable means selected by the manufacturer. Accordingly, this proposal
would contribute to the safe operation of the airplane and would not appreciably add to the cost of the airplane design.

Section 23.1351&blank;General

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise current &sect;23.1351 by removing portions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) and by removing
all of paragraph (b)(4). The removed requirements are applicable to alternators that depend upon the battery for
initial excitation or for stabilization. This revision responds to a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation to
remove the provisions that allow a battery failure to result in the loss of the alternator. Information in this recommendation
showed that self-excited alternators are now available for installation on newly certificated airplanes. The FAA
has verified that self-excited alternators are now available; therefore, there is no longer a need for the regulations
to address alternators that depend upon a battery for initial excitation and stabilization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;23.1351(c)(3) would require an automatic means for reverse current protection. Reverse current
protection is accomplished by means that automatically detect changes in the current. The proposed revised wording
would more accurately define this function and the equipment that would accomplish the protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;23.1351(f) would be revised by adding a requirement that would require the ground power receptacle
to be located where its use will not result in a hazard to the airplane or to people on the ground using the receptacle.

Section 23.1353&blank;Storage Battery Design and Installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1353(h) would require that, in the event of a complete loss of the primary electrical power
generating system, airplane battery capacity must be sufficient to supply at least 30 minutes of electrical power
to those loads essential to the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal is not limited to airplanes that are approved for any particular type of operation. Although the battery
capacity needed for an airplane approved for day visual flight rules (VFR) operations would be much less than the capacity
for an airplane approved for day/night instrument flight rules (IFR) operations, the same level of safety should
be provided for all airplanes. While this proposal would add an additional requirement to part 23 for normal, utility,
acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes, in practice this requirement to provide a battery capacity sufficient
to supply at least 30 minutes of electrical power is not new to many airplane manufacturers. Certain other countries
in which part 23 airplanes have been certificated have requirements for such a 30-minute battery capacity. Manufacturers'
experience with these requirements has shown that the only design impact that results from complying with these requirements
is the need to install a battery with greater capacity than might otherwise be installed. Experience has also shown
that a load shedding procedure may be necessary for certain airplanes. No other airplane design changes would be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the above referenced experience record, this requirement would be new to some manufacturers and they may
have questions on how it would be applied. For that reason, this notice discusses compliance considerations that
have emerged from experience based on substantively equivalent requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This compliance experience has shown that the rating of the battery selected for the airplane should be sufficient
to cover the loss of capacity that would occur with battery age and the reduced capacity that results from a realistic
state of charge, which may be less than a full charge. Using a design battery capacity that is only 75 percent of the battery
nameplate rating would be an acceptable way of accounting for these losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to determining the battery rating that would be needed, the manufacturer would also need to determine
the functions that would be necessary for 30 minutes of safe flight and the landing of the airplane. Again, experience
has identified several functions. For a day VFR approved airplane, no functions may require battery power; however,
it may be necessary to supply power for certain communication capacities or, if the airplane has electrically powered
retractable landing gear, power may be required to lower the gear. Providing a secondary means for lowering the gear
would be an acceptable alternative to providing electrical power or battery power for this function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other types of operating approvals, providing power for the following functions and equipment should be considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Any required flight and navigation instruments. Air driven instruments that would function over the required
period can also be accepted for this function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cockpit and instrument lighting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For IFR and icing approvals, power for the heated pitot tube.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For radio communication, usually one VHF communication system with power for three to five minutes of transmission
would be acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Functions needed for safe night flight and night landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Electronic engine ignition systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Any functions that cannot be readily shed following the loss of generator power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Engine inlet heat or deicing protection required for normal operation of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although power for the listed functions may provide for the safe operation and landing of most airplanes, individual
airplane designs may require the consideration of additional functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying these rules it may be assumed that airframe and engine icing protection equipment would not be operating
at the time of the generator system failure. Power for icing protection would not be required if the icing protection
equipment is not required for the normal operation of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would require additional battery capacity and would not alter or supersede any other requirements
in this part for separate or dedicated emergency power supplies. When requirements such as those in current &sect;23.1331(a)
or in proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) are applicable to the airplane design, these power supplies are required to provide
a needed level of safety for that function; therefore, that power source must be supplied.

Section 23.1359&blank;Electrical System Fire Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1359 would require smoke and fire protection for electrical system installations. The provisions
of &sect;23.1359(a) of this proposal state that electrical systems must meet the applicable requirements of &sect;&sect;23.863
and 23.1182.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1359(b) would require that the electrical systems components installed in designated fire zones
and used during emergency procedures be fire resistant. This provision is needed to clarify the requirements for
electrical system components that may be installed in the designated fire zones identified in &sect;23.1181.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;23.1359(c) provides burn criteria for electrical wire and cables. A proposed revision to appendix
F of part 23 that would add appropriate wire testing criteria is included in this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed burn criteria for wire is necessary because of the increased use of electrical systems in the design
of part 23 airplanes and the resulting increase in the amount of electrical wire being installed. This increased use
results in the need to ensure that wire insulating material does not become the source of an in-flight fire and/or that
it does not propagate a fire from another source. The electrical wire burn requirements in this proposal, along with
the testing identified in revised appendix F, would ensure that installed electrical wire has insulating material
that reduces the possibility of hazardous in-flight fires.

Section 23.1365&blank;Electrical Cables and Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.1365(b) and would add three new paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.1365(b) would be revised in relation to proposed new &sect;23.1359(c), which would require self-extinguishing
insulated electrical wires and cables. Current &sect;23.1365(b) requires that cable and associated equipment
that would overheat in the event of circuit overload or fault must be flame resistant and may not emit dangerous quantities
of toxic fumes. The proposed revisions to &sect;23.1365(b) would remove the reference to electrical cables from
the flame resistance requirement since the cables would be required to have self-extinguishing insulation under
&sect;23.1359(c). The requirement for electrical cables and the associated equipment that would overheat to not
emit dangerous quantities of toxic fumes has been retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of &sect;23.1365(b) that includes the words ``at least flame resistant '' would also be revised by removing
the words ``at least''. The removed words implied that there were burn requirements, other than the ones in this section,
that must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three paragraphs that would be added by this proposal would require: (1) The identification of electrical cables,
terminals, and connectors; (2) the protection of electrical cables from damage by external sources; and (3) installation
criteria for cables that cannot be protected by a circuit protection device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As identified in the discussion of proposed &sect;23.1359, there is an increasing use of electrical systems in part
23 airplanes. The resulting increase in the number of electrical wires used in part 23 airplanes makes proper installation
difficult. The proposal for electrical cable identification would provide better assurance that the cables will
be correctly installed initially and correctly reinstalled when airplane maintenance or modifications are accomplished.
The other proposed new requirements would provide installation criteria that will ensure the protection of cables
under circumstances that can be expected from the increased use of electrical systems.

Section 23.1383&blank;Taxi and Landing Lights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The landing light requirements of &sect;23.1383 would be revised by adding taxi lights to this section. When the landing
light requirements were included in the normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category requirements, the same
lights were used for both night landing and taxiing of the airplane. Due to availability of different types of lights,
separate lights are now frequently installed for landing and for taxiing. Including the word ``taxi'' in the heading
would clarify that the requirements cover both kinds of lights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1383(a), which requires the lights to be acceptable, would be deleted because it is unnecessary
to state this. All lights that are found to meet the requirements of this section and other directly related airworthiness
requirements are acceptable. The paragraphs would be redesignated accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1383(b)(3) requires that a landing light must be installed to provide enough light for a night landing.
Proposed &sect;23.1383(c) would revise ``night landing'' to ``night operation'' since the requirements would
also cover taxiing and parking. Proposed new paragraph (d) would require the lights to be installed so that they do
not cause a fire hazard. This clarifies the need for such an evaluation.

Section 23.1401&blank;Anticollision Light System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.1401 to require the installation of an anticollision light system on all part
23 airplanes. Current &sect;23.1401 requires an anticollision light system only if certification for night operations
is requested. When the requirements for anticollision lights were first added to the Civil Air Regulations (CAR),
part 3, in 1957, those requirements were needed to increase the conspicuity of the airplanes during night operations
because of the increasing air traffic density and the newer airplanes' capability to attain higher speeds. At the
time, the operating conditions did not show a need for such lights for daylight operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of airplanes that have been added to the fleet and the increasing speeds resulting from improved technology,
especially the increasing use of turbine engines, now necessitates the conspicuity provided by anticollision lights
for day operations as well. The FAA Accident and Incident data for the period 1984 through 1990 shows that 269 aircraft
were involved in midair collisions in which 108 fatalities occurred. A review of this data shows that 234 of these aircraft
were involved in accidents or incidents that occurred during VFR conditions and that 224 were involved in accidents
or incidents during day operations. The other 10 were involved in operations at night or dusk. The reports on 35 aircraft
did not identify the type of condition that existed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the types of aircraft identified by the reports in this data, 60 were balloons, gliders, or other aircraft that were
not certificated under part 23 and whose level of safety would not be changed by this proposal. When the data is revised
by removing those reports, it shows that 209 small, part 23 airplanes operated under VFR conditions were involved
in midair accidents or incidents and that at least 167 of these airplanes were being operated in day VFR conditions.
Because the occupant capacity of all the aircraft in the data ranged from one to ten, it can be assumed that the fatality
rate of .401 per aircraft (108 fatalities/269 aircraft) would be nearly the same for the 167 small airplanes operating
in day VFR conditions as it was for the 269 aircraft. Based on this assumption, there would have been approximately
67 fatalities that occurred in these 167 small airplane accidents and incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reports do not show if the airplanes involved were equipped with or were using anticollision lights. They do show
that a need exists to reduce the number of accidents. Requiring the installation of anticollision lights on all newly
certificated airplanes and, as proposed by revised &sect;91.209 in this notice, requiring operation of anticollision
lights during day operations would increase the airplane's conspicuity and contribute to a reduction in the number
of accidents. Even if such action is only 25 percent effective, a review of the 6-year service history indicates that
approximately 17 fatalities could be avoided in a similar 6-year period. Many manufacturers have realized the additional
safety that can be provided by the increased airplane conspicuity of using anticollision lights and have elected
to install an anticollision light system on all of the airplanes they produce. Therefore, most airplanes are now being
manufactured with an installed anticollision light system, and the FAA expects that this proposal would not result
in an economic burden on the aviation community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would add three new paragraphs to &sect;23.1431. Proposed new paragraph (c) would require that airplanes
required to be operated by more than one flightcrew member must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members
can converse without difficulty when they are seated at their duty stations. Accident investigations have shown
that, in some instances, conversation between the flightcrew members was severely hindered by the noise level in
the cockpit and that the inability to communicate contributed to the accident. If the required evaluation shows that
the noise level does not impair conversation, no further action is required. However, if the evaluation shows that
conversation will be difficult, an intercommunication system would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (d) would require that if installed communication equipment includes any means of switching
from receive to transmit, the equipment must use ``off-on'' transmitter switching that will ensure that the transmitter
is turned off when it is not being used. Transmitting equipment that remains in the transmit mode when not being used
blocks the frequency being used and can create an unsafe condition by preventing other needed communication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (e) would require that if provisions for the use of communications headsets are provided,
it must be demonstrated that flightcrew members can hear aural warnings when a headset is being used. Aural warnings
are required to warn the pilot of a condition that necessitates the pilot's taking action; therefore, it is necessary
to ensure that such warnings would be effective even when headsets are being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the proposed new requirements in paragraphs (c) and (e), the FAA considered proposing a
requirement that compliance demonstrations should be conducted under actual cockpit noise conditions when the
airplane is being operated. The FAA, however, ultimately determined that such a requirement could result in demonstrations
conducted under more severe noise conditions than needed. Accordingly, no such requirement is being proposed. If
the FAA determines in the future that noise conditions for demonstrations need to be specified, the FAA will define
these conditions in advisory material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1447(a)(4) would require that if radio equipment is installed in an airplane, flightcrew
oxygen dispensing units must be designed to allow the use of communication equipment when oxygen is being used. If
radio equipment is installed, that equipment cannot perform its intended function if the flightcrew is not provided
the proper means for its utilization under all operating conditions, including operations when oxygen is being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would not require all flightcrew oxygen dispensing units to be equipped with communication equipment.
Since an airplane may be operated in uncontrolled airspace, where two-way radio communication is not required and,
at the same time, be at altitudes where oxygen is required for the flightcrew members, some airplanes have a crew oxygen
system but no radio equipment. It would be inappropriate to require the flightcrew dispensing units of those airplanes
to be equipped with communication equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to &sect;23.1447(d) would require the flightcrew oxygen dispensing units to be automatically
presented before the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 15,000 feet or be the quick-donning type if the airplane is certificated
for operation above 25,000 feet. The requirement in paragraph (e) for the passenger dispensing units to be automatically
presented if the airplane is approved for operation above 30,000 feet has not been revised. The revision to paragraph
(d) would provide the flightcrew and the airplane passengers the same level of safety as provided by other airworthiness
standards. This proposed revision is also consistent with the proposed revision of &sect;23.841 in this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would specify that fire protection is needed for oxygen equipment installations. Section
23.1451 (a) and (b) would, respectively, prohibit the installation of oxygen equipment in designated fire zones
and require that oxygen system components be protected from the heat from designated fire zones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1451(c) would require oxygen equipment and lines to be separated from other equipment or to be
protected in a manner that would prevent escaping oxygen from striking grease, fluids, or vapors. The impingement
of pure oxygen on certain materials will lower their combustion point to a value where ignition will occur in ambient
conditions thereby creating a potential source for an airplane fire. In one instance, an airplane was destroyed by
fire that resulted when escaping oxygen impinged on lubricating material during maintenance of the airplane. The
proposed new section would ensure that oxygen systems are protected to prevent fire hazards that can result from escaping
oxygen.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would clarify the rupture protection needed for oxygen system installation. Rupture protection
for oxygen systems is currently required by the application of the structures load requirements of part 23. The addition
of &sect;23.1453(a) would clarify the application of these load requirements and would identify the need to consider
maximum temperatures and pressures that may be present. Section 23.1453(b) would identify the protection to be provided
for high pressure oxygen sources and the high pressure lines that connect such sources to the oxygen system shutoff
valves.

This proposal would revise paragraph (a) of this section to clarify that the requirements apply to high energy rotors
included in an auxiliary power unit (APU). Following the addition of this section to part 23, the FAA issued a policy
message that showed &sect;23.1461 was adopted to cover equipment such as APU's and constant speed drives that may
be installed on small airplanes. The proposed revision of paragraph (a) will clarify the applicability of this section
as identified in that policy material.

meets the burn requirements of &sect;23.1359. It would also add procedures for meeting the 45 degree and 60 degree
angle burn test requirement proposed for &sect;&sect;23.855(c)(2) and 23.1359(c), respectively. Paragraph (b)
would be revised to clarify the specimen configuration that must be used in the testing procedures that are proposed
to be added by this notice.

Regulatory Evaluation, Regulatory Flexibility Determination, and Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that would justify its costs and is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not ``significant'' as defined in DOT's Policies and
Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute
a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section summarizes the costs and benefits of each provision of the proposed rule. Many of the provisions would
impose either no cost or a negligible cost. Such provisions are typically administrative, editorial, clarifying,
relieving, or conforming in nature. In addition, the FAA holds that certain provisions have a potential safety benefit
that can be achieved with no incremental cost, due primarily to the fact that this rule would apply to future certificated
airplanes and retrofitting would not be required. All provisions of the proposed rule, including those with no or
negligible costs, are summarized below. Only those provisions with non-negligible costs are further evaluated
in the section that follows. The reader is directed to the full regulatory evaluation for additional information.

Evaluation of Provisions With Non-Negligible Projected Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes and evaluates those provisions of the proposed rule that are expected to impose costs that
are not negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23.697&blank;Wing Flap Controls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.697(c) would provide safety standards for the wing flap control lever designs installed in
airplanes that use wing flap settings other than fully retracted when showing compliance with &sect;23.145. The
FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could design the flap control lever to meet the proposed requirement in 8
hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $480 per certification. The control lever itself would impose an
incremental cost, including installation, of approximately $100 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nominal benefits of this provision would derive from the increased safety afforded the pilot in positively selecting
the proper flap setting to maintain longitudinal control. In fact, if a flap position other than fully retracted were
needed to maintain longitudinal control: (1) That position would be necessary to prevent an unsafe condition, (2)
the airplane would not be certificated under that design, and (3) the airplane would have to be redesigned so that intermediate
flap positions would not be needed for control. Proposed paragraph (c) would allow the identification of an intermediate
flap position and the positive means of selecting that position. This alternative would rectify the unsafe condition
without requiring the manufacturer to redesign the airplane.

Section 23.703&blank;Takeoff Warning System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would require a takeoff warning system on some commuter category airplanes. The requirement
would be applicable if the flight evaluation shows that an unsafe takeoff condition would result if lift devices or
longitudinal trim devices are set to any position outside the approved takeoff range. If the evaluation shows that
no unsafe condition would result at any setting of these devices, a takeoff warning system would not be required. For
those airplanes on which a warning system must be installed, the proposed rule would provide requirements for the
installation of the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that an evaluation to determine whether a takeoff warning system would be needed would cost $240
(4 hours of engineering at a burdened rate of $60 per hour). Where needed, the integration design of a warning system
would cost $2,400 (40 hours at $60 per hour). In addition, an incremental 4 hours of flight testing at a cost of $2,720
($500 per hour for two test pilots and $180 per hour for fuel) would be needed to demonstrate the system's performance.
The FAA estimates that the system, including acquisition, wiring, micro switches, and labor, would add approximately
$1,000 to the cost of each airplane required to have one. Maintenance of such a system would cost approximately $100
per year. The FAA solicits comments from interested parties concerning the expected certifications that would require
a takeoff warning system and the concomitant costs to acquire, install, and maintain them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nominal benefits of this proposal would derive from the increased safety provided by the takeoff warning system
that would activate whenever lift or longitudinal trim devices are not set within their approved takeoff ranges.
In fact, if an evaluation showed that positions of the lift or longitudinal trim devices could create an unsafe condition
on takeoff, the manufacturer would be required, under existing regulations, to redesign the devices so that the unsafe
positions could not be obtained. The proposed section would provide relief by allowing the applicant to install a
warning system rather than redesigning the trim device(s).

Section 23.735&blank;Brakes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.735(e), applicable to commuter category airplanes, would require establishing the minimum
rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly. Section 23.45 provides
that the determination of the accelerate-stop distance for commuter category airplanes be made in accordance with
the applicant's procedures for operation in service. This proposed requirement is needed to ensure that the brakes
will perform safely under accelerate-stop conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, manufacturers of commuter airplanes could determine the kinetic energy absorption requirements
either through a conservative rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during a rejected takeoff or by
using a formula presented in proposed new &sect;23.735(e)(2). It is projected that the necessary determination
would cost $240 based on four hours of engineering at a burdened rate of $60 per hour. The potential benefits of the proposal
would derive from the added safety that would be provided by establishing beforehand the minimum necessary kinetic
energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly under rejected-takeoff conditions.

Section 23.775&blank;Windshields and Windows
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Introductory text and paragraph (h)(1) would be added to require that commuter category windshield panes that are
directly in front of the pilots be able to withstand the impact of a two pound bird at maximum approach flap speed. By
requiring full protection against the strike of a two-pound bird at approach speed, additional protection would
also be provided if the airplane strikes a larger bird or strikes a bird at a higher speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.775(h)(2) would further require the panels of the windshield to be so arranged that, if one is damaged,
other panels would remain to provide visibility for continuous safe flight and landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs of proposed &sect;23.775(h) would vary depending on the circumstances of the affected manufacturer.
Industry sources estimate that the total nonrecurring cost per model would range from $250,000 to $350,000, consisting
of: (1) Up to $200,000 for a bird strike test article (``bird gun'') if the manufacturer does not have one; and (2) up
to $150,000 of time and materials costs for the actual testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer that has a bird strike test article would not incur additional capital test costs. Most manufacturers
would incur up to $150,000 in time and materials costs for the actual testing, but even these costs would be mitigated
by the existing need of most manufacturers to perform such tests for export sales to JAA member countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that there would be no identifiable increment in design or tooling costs since the windshield
would be an integral part of the initial design. Similarly, little or no recurring costs per airplane (incremental
materials, installation, or weight) are projected since it is reasonable to assume that the pressure load, as compared
to bird strike resistance, would be the controlling factor in the windshield design strength.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefit of the proposed rule is the incremental protection against bird strikes that would be afforded to commuter
category airplanes. The FAA has reviewed International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data on bird strikes
that occurred on member-country airplanes of 19,000 pounds or less than 1981 through 1989. These data show that approximately
550 strikes occurred and that one out of seven strikes hit the windshield. The data show that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Almost 52 percent of the strikes occurred at altitudes of less than 100 feet, and 26.7 percent occurred between 101
and 1000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Eighty-five percent of the strikes occurred at airspeeds of 150 knots or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Where bird types were reported, 27.6 percent of the strikes involved small birds and 58.6 involved medium size birds
(2 pounds or less).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Incidents where the airplane was damaged showed that 16.9 percent resulted from small bird strikes and 64 percent
resulted from medium size bird strikes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These data show that most bird strikes occur at takeoff and landing altitudes and airspeeds, and that birds weighing
two pounds or less are struck most often. The standards of the proposed provision are based on these statistics. Few
fatalities and injuries resulted from the bird strikes reported in the ICAO data. Similarly, a review of NTSB accident
records between 1982 and 1992 revealed no U.S. accidents resulting from bird strikes to the windshields of commuter
category airplanes. As a result, the FAA is not able to illustrate the justification of this provision on the basis
of historical accidents. Instead, the standards are being proposed based on the expert recommendations of the ARAC.
It is also noted that this standard will be applied in JAA member countries and that U.S. manufacturers wishing to export
to those countries would be required to meet the standard in any event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that this provision cannot be quantitatively supported on the basis of past accidents alone, the FAA expressly
requests public input and comments on its expected costs and potential benefits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new paragraph (f) would require that the locks on lavatory doors, if installed, be designed so that they would
not trap occupants. Lavatory door locks used in transport category airplanes (see &sect;25.783) meet the requirements
of this proposed rule. The FAA estimates that the incremental cost of this provision would be no more than $25 per lock.
The proposal would reduce the likelihood that occupants would be trapped in a locked lavatory, both in emergency and
non-emergency situations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would extend to normal, utility, and acrobatic airplanes the existing commuter requirement to
prevent baggage from hazardous shifting. The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer would be required for 1 hour,
at a burdened cost of $60 per hour, to analyze the subject loads that would need to be constrained. Tiedowns would cost
approximately $50 per baggage compartment, or no more than $100 per airplane. These additional costs would apply
only to normal, utility, or acrobatic airplanes since commuter category airplanes are already subject to the requirement
under the existing rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential benefits of the proposed provision include the reduced likelihood: (1) That baggage compartments
would be overloaded, (2) that stowed baggage would shift dangerously, and (3) that essential co-located equipment
or wiring would be damaged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would require at least one illuminated sign notifying all passengers when seat belts should
be fastened. The requirement would apply only to airplanes where flightcrew members could not observe occupant seats
or where the flightcrew compartment is separated from the passenger compartment. The signs would have to be legible
to all seated passengers and be operable from a crewmember station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could design the required sign(s) in 1 hour, at a burdened rate of $60 per
hour. The sign would cost approximately $200 per airplane, including parts and installation costs. Maintenance
costs for bulb replacement would be negligible. The weight penalty associated with the light system would also be
minor (no more than 2 pounds).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety benefits of the proposed change would derive from the increased likelihood that passengers would know
when their seat belts should be fastened.

Proposed new &sect;23.807(a)(4) would provide the same hazard protection for a person using an emergency exit as
that provided by proposed &sect;23.783(b) for a person who uses a passenger door. Emergency exits could not be located
with respect to a propeller disk or any other hazard in a manner that would endanger persons using that exit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA holds that no incremental cost would be incurred to meet the standards of the proposed provision for newly certificated
airplanes. However, this notice specifically requests that interested parties submit comments on the potential
costs and methods of compliance that manufacturers would choose to comply with this proposed requirement.

The proposed revision to &sect;23.807(b)(5) would editorially revise the current egress requirements for acrobatic
airplanes. New &sect;23.807(b)(6) would establish similar egress standards for utility category airplanes that
are certificated for spinning. Industry sources estimate that an aerobatic, quick-release door would cost an incremental
$10,000 in engineering design per affected airplane model and an additional $500 per production airplane. Little
or no additional weight is expected. These costs would apply only in cases where the manufacturer determines that
the marketplace return of a combination type certificate would outweigh the additional costs of design and production.

The proposed revision to &sect;23.841(a) would extend the cabin pressure requirements of current paragraph (a),
which now apply to airplanes certificated for operation above 31,000 feet, to airplanes certificated for operation
above 25,000 feet. Current part 25, JAR 25, and proposed JAR 23 include the same requirement proposed here. This proposed
requirement is intended to protect airplane occupants from harm if a malfunction occurs at altitudes where symptoms
of hypoxia occur, usually above 25,000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For airplanes that will be certificated for maximum altitude operation between 25,000 feet and 31,000 feet, the proposal
would necessitate two additional pressure altitude regulators and associated plumbing. Industry sources estimate
that the proposed requirement would cost an incremental $1,000 in engineering design per affected airplane model
and $2,000 per production airplane. Any additional weight would be negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of the proposal would derive from the incremental protection against hypoxia afforded to occupants
of airplanes certificated for maximum altitude between 25,000 and 31,000 feet. Due to the increasing use of turbine
engines, more part 23 airplanes are likely to be approved for operation above 25,000 feet. In the absence of this proposed
rule, an increasing number of occupants would be exposed to the potential for harm in the event of a failure or malfunction
of the pressure system on these airplanes.

Section 23.855&blank;Cargo and Baggage Compartment Fire Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) would require all sources of heat within each cargo and baggage compartment that are capable
of igniting the compartment contents to be shielded and insulated to prevent such ignition. Existing &sect;23.787(f)
requires that cargo compartment lamps be installed so as to prevent contact between the lamp bulb and cargo. The proposal
would clarify and extend this provision to include all sources of heat for baggage as well as cargo compartments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lights and (rarely) heaters for pets are typically the only sources of heat located in a baggage or cargo compartment.
A wire cage, costing no more than $20, around the heat source would meet these requirements. The FAA estimates that
the cost of compliance per airplane would be no more than $40 in those rare cases where such protection would not have
been provided anyway. The benefit of the proposed provision is a reduction in the possibility of fire caused by the
ignition of compartment contents by lights or heaters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) would require cargo and baggage compartments to be constructed of materials that meet the
appropriate provisions of &sect;23.853(d)(3). Currently these requirements apply to commuter category airplanes
and to the materials used in the compartments of these airplanes. The proposed new requirement would expand this applicability
to the cargo and baggage compartments of all part 23 airplanes. In effect, the proposed new requirement would require
materials that are self-extinguishing rather than flame resistant as currently required under &sect;23.787(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information provided by manufacturers shows that materials that meet self-extinguishing flame requirements are
available at a slightly higher cost than materials that meet flame resistant requirements. The FAA conservatively
estimates that the incremental costs of complying with proposed &sect;23.855(b) would be less than $200 per airplane.
The safety benefits of this provision would be an increase in cargo and baggage compartment fire protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (c) would add new fire protection requirements for cargo and baggage compartments for commuter
category airplanes. The proposed rule would require one of the following three alternatives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The compartment just be located where pilots seated at their duty station would easily discover the fire or the
compartment must be equipped with a smoke or fire detector system to warn the pilot's station. The compartment must
also be accessible for fire extinguisher application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The compartment may be inaccessible, but must be equipped with a fire detector system that warns the pilot station,
and the compartment must have ceiling and sidewall floor panels constructed of materials that have been subjected
to and meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F to part 23. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The compartment must be constructed and sealed to contain any fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA cannot predict the designs of cargo and baggage compartment for future airplanes. If manufacturers choose
to use smoke detectors, however, no more than 2 smoke detectors would be required per airplane. An aerospace engineer
could determine the most appropriate location and design the smoke detector system in approximately 30 hours at a
burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $1,800 per certification. Two detectors, including wiring and installation,
are estimated to cost about $4,550. Maintenance costs for the smoke detectors would cost approximately $100 per year.
Materials that would meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F (see option 2 in the discussion above)
would result in incremental costs of less than $200 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would cost $500 to construct a sealed compartment, or a total of $1,000 for 2 compartments,
if the manufacturer chooses that method of complying with the proposed requirement (see option 3 in the discussion
above).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irrespective of the individual compliance method, the benefits of the proposed provision would come from the increased
likelihood that a cargo or baggage compartment fire would either be extinguished or contained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revised &sect;23.1303(d) would add the requirement for a free air temperature indicator for those airplanes whose
performance must be based on weight, altitude, and temperature. This requirement already applies to turbine powered
airplanes. The proposal would extend the requirement to reciprocating engine powered airplanes of more than 6,000
pounds. Industry sources estimate that the proposed requirement would cost an incremental $500 in engineering design
per affected airplane model and $350 per production airplane. Any additional weight would be negligible. The potential
benefits of the proposal would accrue from the requirement that the information necessary to determine the performance
envelope of the airplane be available to the pilot.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1303(g) would identify specific instruments, and limits of those instruments, required for
commuter category airplanes. Proposed &sect;23.1303(g)(1) states that if airspeed limitations vary with altitude,
the airspeed indicators must show the variation of the maximum operating limit speed (V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) with altitude. Industry sources indicate that an airspeed indicator with V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``pointer'' would cost $1,000 more than one without. Two airspeed indicators are required on commuter airplanes,
therefore, the incremental cost of this requirement would be $2,000 per commuter category airplane produced. The
potential safety benefit of the proposal would derive from the requirement that the information necessary to determine
the maximum operating limit speed be available at all altitudes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1303(g)(3) would require (for commuter category IFR-approved airplanes with passenger seating
configurations of 10 more) a third, independent, attitude indicator (AI). Industry sources estimate that an aerospace
engineer could design and document a third attitude instrument system in 100 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour,
totalling $6,000 per certification. It is estimated that an AI would cost approximately $8,000, including a standby
battery, and that the installation would cost $2,200 for 40 hours of a mechanic's time at a burdened rate of $55 per hour.
However, proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5), discussed below, would delete the requirement for a rate-of-turn indicator
when an independent attitude indicator is installed. The costs associated with a rate-of-turn indicator include:
40 hours of design and documentation costs, $1,000 per indicator, and 40 hours of installation. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
incremental 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cost for an IFR-approved airplane with a passenger seating capacity of 10 or more would be $3,600 for 60 hours of engineering
(100 hours for the AI, minus 40 hours for the rate-of-turn indicator); $7,000 for the instrument ($8,000 for the AI,
minus $1,000 for the rate-of-turn indicator); and no additional cost for the installation (40 hours for the AI, minus
40 hours for the rate-of-turn indicator). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential safety benefits of a third, independent attitude indicator would derive from the reduced potential
for erroneous attitude information. Currently, two attitude instruments are required for a ten passenger, IFR approved
commuter category airplane. Service experience has shown that a failure can occur whereby an attitude indicator
can appear to be working when it is actually providing incorrect information. During such a failure, pilots may have
difficulty determining which instrument to follow, and hazardous flight attitudes may result. A third attitude
indicator would allow the crew to retain reliable attitude information even in cases where one instrument is not operating
correctly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new G23.1326 would require the installation of a pitot tube heat indicating system on those airplanes required
to be equipped with a heated pitot tube. Heated pitot tubes ensure that moisture will not freeze in the tube and block
or partially block the airspeed system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pitot heat indicating system, including an in-line current sensor, panel light, and associated wiring, would cost
approximately $500. According to industry sources, an aerospace engineer could design and document such a system
in 20 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $1,200. A mechanic could install the system in 20 hours at a burden
rate of $55 per hour, totalling $1,100. The estimated non-recurring cost per certification, therefore, would total
$2,800 ($1,200 for design, $500 for the certification airplane's indicator, and $1,100 for installation of that
indicator). The estimated cost per production airplane would be $1,600 ($500 for the system and $1,100 for installation).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated a series of single model accidents that occurred between
May 1989 and March 1991. During that period, five fatal accidents and a near fatal incident occurred in the United States.
Two additional fatal accidents involving the same airplane model occurred in foreign countries. The NTSB's analysis
indicated that four of the five U.S. accidents probably involved ice blockage of the pitot tubes because the pilots
failed to activate pitot heat before flying into freezing instrument meteorological conditions. The Board recommended
(A&hyph;92&hyph;86) that the FAA consider requiring a pitot heat operating light on small airplanes certificated
to operate in icing conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pitot heat indicating system would advise the pilots of any inoperative heating element in the pitot tube and that
subsequent inaccuracies could result. The proposed provision would reduce the likelihood that pilots would rely
on inaccurate airspeed information resulting from a blocked or partially blocked pitot tube.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1353(h) would require that, in the event of a complete loss of the primary electrical power
generating system, airplane battery capacity must be sufficient to supply at least 30 minutes of electrical power
to those loads essential to the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, manufacturers may need to install larger batteries with greater capacities to comply with the proposed
requirements. The FAA estimates that the size and capacity of a larger battery would add no more than a few pounds (incremental
operating costs of less than $10 per year) and $20 to $30 of additional cost for the battery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On some airplanes, a ``load shedding'' procedure, where the pilot would sequentially turn off certain equipment,
could be required either in place of or in addition to a larger battery. The procedure would be provided in the pilot's
operating handbook (POH). The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could establish a load shedding procedure
in 10 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $600 per affected certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irrespective of the method of compliance, the proposal would increase the likelihood that sufficient electrical
power would be available to safely land the airplane in the event of an electrical generating system failure.

Proposed &sect;23.1359(c) would provide burn criteria for electrical wire and cables. A proposed revision to appendix
F to part 23 would add appropriate wire testing criteria. Demonstrating and documenting that electrical wires and
cables meet the requirements of this provision would take an aerospace engineer approximately 4 hours at a burdened
rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $240 per certification. The requirement and testing criteria would increase the
likelihood that necessary wires and cables would continue to function in the event of a fire.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;23.1365(d) would add a requirement for the identification of electrical cables, terminals, and
connectors. Different colored wires and/or tags could be used in conjunction with a wiring diagram to identify the
cables, terminals, and connectors. The FAA estimates that a draftsman could design and document this identification
system in 80 hours at a burdened rate of $55 per hour, a total of $4,400 per certification. Incremental installation
costs would be approximately $100 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increasing use of electrical systems in part 23 airplanes has added to the difficultly of wiring installation.
The proposed requirement for cable identification would increase the likelihood that cables would be correctly

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise &sect;23.1401 to require the installation of an anticollision light system on all part
23 airplanes. Current &sect;23.1401 requires an anticollision light system only if certification for night operations
is requested. Many manufacturers currently install anticollision light systems on all airplanes they produce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that an aerospace engineer could design and document an anticollision light system in
40 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $2,400 per affected certification. The system would cost $500
and would take a mechanic approximately 20 hours to install at a burdened rate of $55 per hour, a total of $1,600 per affected
airplane ($500 + (20 hours &times; $55 per hour) = $1,600). The weight penalty would be negligible. Only those future
models that would not otherwise have anticollision light systems would actually incur incremental costs as a result
of this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of airplanes that have been added to the small airplane fleet and the increasing speeds resulting from improved
technology, especially turbine engines, warrant the use of anticollision lights for day operations as well as night.
The FAA Accident and Incident data for the period 1984 through 1990 show that 269 aircraft were involved in midair collisions
in which 108 fatalities occurred. When the data were filtered (to account for night operations, IFR conditions, and
aircraft not affected by this proposal), it shows that at least 167 airplanes were involved in accidents or incidents
that occurred in day VFR conditions. The reports do not reveal whether the airplanes were using anticollision lights
at the time of the accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA holds that requiring the installation of anticollision lights on all newly certificated airplanes, and requiring
their operation during day operations (as proposed by revised &sect;91.209 and discussed later in this evaluation),
would reduce the number of daylight, midair accidents. Even if the proposed requirement were only 25 percent effective,
the 6-year accident history indicates that approximately 17 fatalities could be avoided during a similar 6-year
period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would add three new paragraphs to &sect;23.1431. Proposed new paragraph (c) would require that airplanes
required to be operated by more than one flightcrew member must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members
can converse without difficulty when they are seated at their duty stations. If the required evaluation shows that
the noise level does not impair conversation, no further action would be required. If the evaluation shows that conversation
would be difficult, however, an intercommunication system would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that an evaluation of cockpit noise could be conducted in conjunction with other certification
testing, therefore, no incremental costs are associated with the evaluation. An aerospace engineer could design
an intercom system in 20 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $1,200 per affected certification. The
FAA estimates that the addition of an intercom system would cost approximately $500 per airplane. A mechanic could
install the system in approximately 20 hours at a burdened rate or $55 per hour. The total incremental production cost
for an affected airplane, therefore, would be $1,600 ($500 + 20 hours &times; $55 per hour)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (d) would require that if the communication equipment that is installed includes any means
of switching from the receive mode to the transmit mode, the equipment must use ``off-on'' transmitter switching
that turns the transmitter off when it is not being used. The cost of this feature is included in the $500 cost of the intercom,
described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB investigation of at least two commuter accidents determined that excessive cockpit noise levels probably adversely
affected the ability of the flight crews to communicate (Bar Harbor Airlines, Flight 1808, August 25, 1985, 8 fatalities;
and Henson Airlines, Flight 1517, September 23, 1985, 14 fatalities.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Board recommended (A&hyph;86&hyph;113) that the FAA require the installation and use of crew interphone
systems in the cockpit of airplanes operating under part 135. The benefit of the proposed requirement would derive
from the increased likelihood that flightcrew members would be able to converse without difficulty and that the safety
hazard of miscommunication would be reduced.

Proposed new &sect;23.1447(a)(4) would require that if radio equipment is installed in an airplane, flightcrew
oxygen dispensing units must be designed to allow use of the communication equipment when oxygen is being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that an oxygen mask with an integral microphone costs $1,000 more than an oxygen mask without
a microphone. The costs per affected airplane, therefore, would be $2,000 for two masks. The benefit of the proposed
requirement is that it would allow flightcrew communication under all operating conditions, including operations
when oxygen is required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would clarify the rupture protection needed for oxygen system installation. Rupture protection
for oxygen systems is currently required by the application of the structures load requirements of part 23. The addition
of &sect;23.1453(a) would clarify the application of these load requirements and would identify the need to consider
maximum temperatures and pressures that may be present. Section 23.1453(b) would identify the protection to be provided
for high pressure oxygen sources and the high pressure lines that connect these sources to the oxygen system shutoff
valves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that an aerospace engineer could analyze and document the loads on each element of the oxygen
system in 16 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $960. The routing of oxygen pressure sources
and lines to protect them from unsafe temperatures and crash landings would be part of an airplane's basic design and
would not impose incremental costs.

lights during all operations, including daytime VFR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incremental cost of this provision would be incurred for light bulb replacement. The FAA estimates that a light
bulb for an anticollision light system costs approximately $50 and that this provision would necessitate an incremental
bulb replacement every two years. Accordingly, the cost is projected to equal $25 per year, per affected operating
airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

if a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number
of small entities. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes threshold cost
values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. The

The FAA proposes to revise the airworthiness standards to provide systems and equipment standards for normal, utility,

by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe. If adopted, the proposed revision would reduce the regulatory burden
on the United States and European airplane manufacturers by relieving them on the need to show compliance with different
standards each time they seek certification approval of an airplane in a different country.

For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation, the FAA has determined
that this proposed regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation
of the proposal has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Proper precautions must be taken to prevent inadvertent, improper, or abrupt trim tab operation. There must be
means near the trim control to indicate to the pilot the direction of trim control movement relative to airplane motion.
In addition, there must be means to indicate to the pilot the position of the trim device with respect to both the range
of adjustment and, in the case of lateral and directional trim, the neutral position. This means must be visible to
the pilot and must be located and designed to prevent confusion. The pitch trim indicator must be clearly marked with
a position or range within which it has been demonstrated that take-off is safe for all center or gravity positions
and each flap position approved for takeoff.

Artificial stall barrier system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the function of an artificial stall barrier, for example, stick pusher, is necessary to show compliance with &sect;23.201(c),
the system must comply with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) With the system adjusted for operation, the plus and minus airspeeds at which downward pitching control will be
provided must be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Considering the plus and minus airspeed tolerances established by paragraph (a) of this section, and airspeed
must be selected for the activation of the downward pitching control that provides a safe margin above any airspeed
at which any unsatisfactory stall characteristics occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition to the stall warning required by &sect;23.207, a warning that is clearly distinguishable to the pilot
under all expected flight conditions without requiring the pilot's attention, must be provided for faults that would
prevent the system from providing the required pitching motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each system must be designed so that the artificial stall barrier can be quickly and positively disengaged by the
pilots to prevent unwanted downward pitching of the airplane by a quick release (emergency) control that meets the
requirements of &sect;23.1329(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A preflight check of the complete system must be established and the procedure for this check made available in
the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Preflight checks that are critical to the safety of the airplane must be included
in the limitations section of the AFM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) For those airplanes whose design includes an autopilot system: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A quick release (emergency) control installed in accordance with &sect;23.1329(b) may be used to meet the requirements
of paragraph (d) of this section, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The pitch servo for that system may be used to provide the stall downward pitching motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In showing compliance with &sect;23.1309, the system must be evaluated to determine the effect that any announced
or unannounced failure may have on the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane or the ability of the crew to
cope with any adverse conditions that may result from such failures. This evaluation must consider the hazards that
would result from the airplane's flight characteristics if the system was not provided, and the hazard that may result
from unwanted downward pitching motion, which could result from failures at airspeeds above the selected stall speed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For commuter category airplanes, unless it can be shown that a lift or longitudinal trim device which affects the takeoff
performance of the aircraft would not give an unsafe takeoff configuration when selected out of an approved takeoff
position, a takeoff warning system must be installed and meet the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The system must provide to the pilots an aural warning that is automatically activated during the initial portion
of the takeoff roll if the airplane is in a configuration that would not allow a safe takeoff. The warning must continue
until_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The configuration is changed to allow safe takeoff, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Action is taken by the pilot to abandon the takeoff roll.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The means used to activate the system must function properly for all authorized takeoff power settings and procedures
and throughout the ranges of takeoff weights, altitudes and temperatures for which certification is requested.

If a retractable landing gear is used, there must be a landing gear position indicator (as well as necessary switches
to actuate the indicator) or other means to inform the pilot that each gear is secured in the extended (or retracted)
position. If switches are used, they must be located and coupled to the landing gear mechanical system in a manner that
prevents an erroneous indication of either ``down and locked'' if each gear is not in the fully extended position,
or of ``up and locked'' if each landing gear is not in the fully retracted position.

Specimen configuration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided for materials used in electrical wire and cable insulation and in small parts, materials must be
tested either as a section cut from a fabricated part as installed in the airplane or as a specimen simulating a cut section,
such as: a specimen cut from a flat sheet of the material or a model of the fabricated part. The specimen may be cut from
any location in a fabricated part; however, fabricated units, such as sandwich panels, may not be separated for a test.
The specimen thickness must be no thicker than the minimum thickness to be qualified for use in the airplane, except
that: (1) Thick foam parts, such as seat cushions, must be tested in 1/2-inch thickness; (2) when showing compliance
with &sect;23.853(d)(3)(v) for materials used in small parts that must be tested, the materials must be tested in
no more than 1/8-inch thickness; (3) when showing compliance with &sect;23.1359(c) for materials used in electrical
wire and cable insulation, the wire and cable specimens must be the same size as used in the airplane. In the case of fabrics,
both the warp and fill direction of the weave must be tested to determine the most critical flammability conditions.
When performing the tests prescribed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this appendix, the specimen must be mounted in a metal
frame so that (1) in the vertical tests of paragraph (d) of this appendix, the two long edges and the upper edge are held
securely; (2) in the horizontal test of paragraph (e) of this appendix, the two long edges and the edge away from the
flame are held securely; (3) the exposed area of the specimen is at least 2 inches wide and 12 inches long, unless the
actual size used in the airplane is smaller; and (4) the edge to which the burner flame is applied must not consist of
the finished or protected edge of the specimen but must be representative of the actual cross section of the material
or part installed in the airplane. When performing the test prescribed in paragraph (f) of this appendix, the specimen
must be mounted in a metal frame so that all four edges are held securely and the exposed area of the specimen is at least
8 inches by 8 inches.

A minimum of three specimens must be tested and the results averaged. The specimens must be supported at an angle of
45 degrees to a horizontal surface. The exposed surface when installed in the aircraft must be face down for the test.
The specimens must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal 3/8-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame
of 11/2 inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in the center
of the flame must be 1550 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. Suitable precautions must be taken to avoid drafts. The flame must be applied for 30 seconds with one-third
contacting the material at the center of the specimen and then removed. Flame time, glow time, and whether the flame
penetrates (passes through) the specimen must be recorded.

Sixty-degree test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A minimum of three specimens of each wire specification (make and size) must be tested. The specimen of wire or cable
(including insulation) must be placed at an angle of 60 degrees with the horizontal in the cabinet specified in paragraph
(c) of this appendix, with the cabinet door open during the test or placed within a chamber approximately 2 feet high
x 1 foot x 1 foot, open at the top and at one vertical side (front), that allows sufficient flow of air for complete combustion
but is free from drafts. The specimen must be parallel to and approximately 6 inches from the front of the chamber. The
lower end of the specimen must be held rigidly clamped. The upper end of the specimen must pass over a pulley or rod and
must have an appropriate weight attached to it so that the specimen is held tautly throughout the flammability test.
The test specimen span between lower clamp and upper pulley or rod must be 24 inches and must be marked 8 inches from the
lower end to indicate the central point for flame application. A flame from a Bunsen or Tirrill burner must be applied
for 30 seconds at the test mark. The burner must be mounted underneath the test mark on the specimen, perpendicular
to the specimen and at an angle of 30 degrees to the vertical plane of the specimen. The burner must have a nominal bore
of three-eighths inch, and must be adjusted to provide a three-inch-high flame with an inner cone approximately one-third
of the flame height. The minimum temperature of the hottest portion of the flame, as measured with a calibrated thermocouple
pyrometer, may not be less than 1,750 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The burner must be positioned so that the hottest portion of the flame is applied to the test mark on the wire.
Flame time, burn length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, must be recorded. The burn length determined in accordance
with paragraph (h) of this appendix must be measured to the nearest one-tenth inch. Breaking of the wire specimen is
not considered a failure.
