SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is adopting a final rule amending the anti-tying provision of Regulation Y to permit a bank or a bank holding
company to offer a discount on a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service (a ``traditional bank product''), or on
securities brokerage services, on condition that the customer obtain a traditional bank product from an affiliate.
The Board believes that this will increase the efficiency with which organizations can deliver banking services.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates. A prohibited
tie occurs if a bank: (1) varies the consideration for a product or service (the ``tying product'') on the condition
that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank or from any of its
affiliates; or (2) as a condition for providing a customer a product or service, requires the customer to purchase
another product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates. In 1971, the Board applied these tying restrictions
to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries as if they were banks. 12 CFR 225.4(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 contains an exception (the ``traditional bank product exception'') permitting a bank to tie a product
to a traditional bank product offered by that bank, but not by any affiliated bank or nonbank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, for example, the statutory exception permits a bank to offer a discount on a loan on the condition that a customer
maintain a deposit account at that bank; however, the bank may not offer a discount on a loan on the condition that a customer
maintain a deposit account at an affiliated bank.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, under the Board's extension of section 106 to nonbanks in Regulation Y, a nonbank may tie a product to a traditional
bank product offered by itself, but not by an affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 11, 1994, the Board requested public comment on two proposed exceptions to section 106. 59 FR 12,202 (March
16, 1994). The first exception would extend the statutory traditional bank product exception described above to
permit a bank or bank holding company to offer a discount on a traditional bank product to a customer who obtains another
traditional bank product from an affiliate. The second proposed exception would permit a bank or bank holding company
to offer a discount on securities brokerage services to a customer who obtains a traditional bank product from an affiliate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 authorizes the Board to permit, by regulation or order, exceptions from its anti-tying provisions where
the Board determines that an exception will not be contrary to the purposes of the section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received 68 comments on its proposal. These commenters included 31 bank holding companies, 17 banks, two
law firms, five Reserve Banks and seven trade associations. Overall, the comments supported both parts of the proposed
rule. One commenter generally opposed the proposed amendments because it believed that exceptions to section 106
should be provided on a case-by-case basis and not as a general matter through rulemaking, and that by acting on individual
requests, the Board would be able to prevent potential anticompetitive effects, especially in small towns. The Board
has concluded, however, that the benefits and costs of the proposal may be assessed in the aggregate and that rulemaking
is appropriate.

Traditional Bank Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is adopting substantially as proposed the extension of the traditional bank product exception in section
106 to cover discount arrangements involving an affiliate. In particular, the final rule permits a bank or nonbank
to vary the consideration charged for a traditional bank product on the condition that a customer obtain another traditional
bank product from an affiliate, provided that each product in the arrangement is separately available for purchase
by the customer. The Board believes that the exception is fully consistent with the purposes of section 106, will increase
the efficiency with which banking organizations can deliver banking services, and will allow those organizations
to provide their customers discounts on packages of banking products that include products offered by affiliates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, section 106 contains an exception permitting a bank to tie a product to a traditional bank product offered
by that same bank. The Senate Report accompanying section 106 states that the traditional bank product exception
was intended to preserve a customer's ability to negotiate the price of multiple banking services with the bank on
the basis of the customer's entire relationship with the bank. S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 16&hyph;17 (1970).
The Board believes that it is consistent with this stated statutory purpose for a bank or bank holding company to offer
a discount on packages of traditional bank products when one of the component products in the package is offered by
an affiliate. Since 1970 and 1971, there has been a substantial increase in the number of affiliates in bank holding
company organizations and the extent of specialization of these affiliates, which has led to customers obtaining
traditional bank products from multiple affiliates, both bank and nonbank. Adoption of the proposed rule will be
consistent with the purposes of section 106 by allowing a customer to negotiate the price of multiple traditional
banking services on the basis of the customer's entire relationship with a bank holding company organization, as
opposed to just a single bank within such an organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By allowing bank holding companies to package traditional bank products offered by multiple subsidiaries, the exception
also will increase the efficiency with which bank holding companies can deliver those products. Several commenters
explained that the existing rule had created a disincentive for bank holding companies to consolidate a given traditional
bank product in one affiliate (and thereby lose the exemption for that activity), as opposed to offering the product
through all its subsidiary banks (retaining the exemption at each bank but forfeiting efficiency gains). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of the proposed exception to section 106 will not only permit bank holding companies to offer products more
efficiently but also will allow their customers to benefit. Customers will be able to realize cost savings when they
obtain traditional bank products from two or more subsidiaries of a bank holding company instead of just one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the inter-affiliate traditional bank product exception will allow bank holding company affiliates to offer
customers a more favorable price on packages of banking products, thereby relieving bank holding companies of a competitive
disadvantage and benefitting their customers, the Board has concluded that the amendment is consistent with the
purposes of section 106 and should be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested an expansion of the proposed exception to include inter-affiliate arrangements in
which the tying product is a non-traditional bank product and the tied product is a traditional bank product. The Board
has decided not to extend the statutory traditional bank product exception to inter-affiliate tying involving non-traditional
bank products at this time. However, in a separate notice, the Board is proposing to amend the tying restrictions of
Regulation Y to permit any discount arrangement that involves only nonbank affiliates.

Discounts on Securities Brokerage Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1993, the Board approved an exemption for a brokerage subsidiary of a bank to offer a discount on brokerage
services to its customers who maintain a minimum balance in an account at the bank or any affiliated bank.

 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 166 (1994). The Board concluded that the requested exemption was consistent with the
legislative purpose of section 106 (to prevent banks from using their economic power to engage in anticompetitive
practices) and the legislative purpose of the Board's exemptive authority (to allow appropriate traditional banking
practices based on sound economic analysis). In its order, the Board found that the market for retail brokerage services
was national in scope and highly competitive, making it unlikely that any of these banks_or any other provider of brokerage
services_could exercise sufficient market power in brokerage services to impair competition in the market for traditional
banking services. As part of the order, the Board required that the two products in the arrangement be separately available
for purchase by the customer, noting that under antitrust precedent, concerns about tying are substantially reduced
when the buyer is free to take either product by itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is adopting substantially as proposed an amendment to Regulation Y making this exemption available to all
bank holding companies. This amendment will permit any bank or bank holding company to offer a discount on brokerage
services if a customer obtains a traditional bank product from any affiliate. The regulatory exception is conditioned
on the brokerage services and traditional bank products offered in the arrangement being separately available for
purchase by the customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters overwhelmingly favored the proposed amendment. Commenters stated that the regulatory exception would
promote fair competition with nonbank competitors and would result in cost savings and other benefits to customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A securities industry association opposed the proposed exception because it believed that the exception would increase
customer confusion by reinforcing the false impression that brokerage services offered by banks are insured by the
federal government. However, the recent inter-agency statement on retail sales of non-deposit investment products
specifies steps that banks should take to prevent confusion, including informing customers in writing that the products
are not federally insured, are not deposits or other obligations of the institution and are not guaranteed by the institution,
and involve investment risks including possible loss of principal. In addition, the statement restricts where an
institution may offer non-deposit investment products. The Board believes that this statement satisfactorily
addresses any possibility of an increase in customer confusion about coverage of federal deposit insurance where
banks offer brokerage services as part of a package arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that the Board clarify that ``brokerage services'' refers to ``securities brokerage
services'' and that securities brokerage services include related incidental services as authorized by Regulation
Y. These technical changes are consistent with the intent of the proposed rule, and will be included in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the Board grant an exception permitting a bank or a bank holding company to vary the
consideration charged for a traditional bank product, such as a deposit service, based on a customer's purchase of
brokerage services_the converse of the proposed exception. The Board believes that this proposal should be evaluated
in the context of a specific exemption request. One such request has been published for comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters sought an interpretation that ties involving mutual funds were either wholly or partially exempt
from section 106, either because mutual funds are not bank holding company subsidiaries or because mutual fund products
constitute trust services and therefore qualify as traditional bank products. The Board intends to address this
issue separately.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters sought clarification on whether both proposed exceptions were limited to cases where the tying product
was offered by a bank, or also included cases where the tying product was offered by a bank holding company or its nonbanking
subsidiary. The concern arose because the proposed exceptions were phrased only in terms of banks. The Board notes
that the language of section 225.4(d)(1) of Regulation Y would automatically apply the proposed exceptions for banks
to bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries, as was intended by the proposed rulemaking. However,
the final rule has been amended to make this coverage explicit. Rather than referring to a ``bank'' offering a traditional
bank product or a discount on brokerage services, the rule refers to a ``bank holding company or bank or nonbank subsidiary
thereof.''

Reorganization of Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a non-substantive change, the Board has restructured the regulation to make it more easily understandable. The
regulation has been moved from the section on corporate practices, &sect;225.4, and established as its own section,
&sect;225.7. The application of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries is contained
in paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) contains exceptions to both section 106 and &sect;225.7(a), and paragraph (c) contains
limitations on each of those exceptions. Finally, a definition paragraph, &sect;225.7(d), has been added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the exception for credit card services previously contained in &sect;225.4(d)(2) has been removed
from the regulation, as all transactions previously excepted under that provision are now excepted under the traditional
bank product exception in &sect;225.7(b)(1). Also, the phrase ``(but no other products)'' has been deleted in places
where it was superfluous. These changes are not substantive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document provides a statement of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policy concerning noise limits for
future civil supersonic airplanes (SST). The FAA is withdrawing a previously published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) that proposed to amend the regulations regarding type certification noise limits of these airplanes. This
document supplements the withdrawal of the proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, the FAA proposed to amend the type certification noise standards and noise operating rules for future-generation
civil supersonic airplanes. After analyzing the comments received on the NPRM, the FAA determined that further investigation
and research is necessary before a final rule can be developed. The withdrawal of that NPRM its published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although the proposed rule is being withdrawn, the FAA has not changed its policy on noise issues involving the development
of future-generation civil supersonic airplanes.

Policy Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While it is premature at this time to issue a final rule establishing the specific noise standard for such supersonic
airplanes, it is important to reiterate the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) commitment to aviation's longstanding
efforts to achieve increasingly effective noise abatement at its source. Consequently, it is anticipated that any
future Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by FAA would propose that any future SST airplane shall produce no greater
noise impact on a community than a subsonic airplane certified to Stage 3 noise limits. As such, the noise limits prescribed
in 14 CFR part 36, Stage 3 may be used as guidelines for the development of any future SST airplane. This is consistent
with the recommendation recently added to Chapter 4 of the International Civil Aviation Organization's Annex 16,
Volume I, that states that Chapter 3 noise levels applicable to subsonic airplanes may be used as guidelines for future
SST airplanes. Provisions for the noise certification of future SST airplanes will be developed giving consideration,
to the extent possible, to the unique operational flight characteristics of future SST designs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, in connection with the consolidation of the Office of Opinions and Review into the Office of the General Counsel,
the responsibility to advise the Commission, make certain procedural decisions, and take certain actions in connection
with Rule 2(e) proceedings was delegated to the Executive Assistant to the Chairman. The delegation was designed
to ensure required separation of functions in light of the fact that the General Counsel was then responsible for prosecuting
Rule 2(e) proceedings. In February 1993, the Task Force on Administrative Proceedings of the Securities and Exchange
Commission recommended that the authority to advise the Commission with respect to Rule 2(e) proceedings be delegated
to the Office of the General Counsel. Since then, responsibility for the prosecution of Rule 2(e) proceedings involving
professionals, other than attorneys, has been transferred to the Division of Enforcement. Transfer of the responsibility
to advise the Commission, make certain procedural decisions, and take certain actions in connection with Rule 2(e)
proceedings would permit the Commission to employ, with respect to those proceedings, the staff that reviews and
prepares opinions and orders in other proceedings decided by the Commission. The Commission has determined to adopt
the Task Force's recommendations and is not delegating the responsibility to advise the Commission, make certain
procedural decisions, and take certain actions in connection with Rule 2(e) proceedings to the General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The delegation provides that, in a case in which the involvement of the General Counsel is deemed inappropriate for
any reason, the Executive Assistant to the Chairman, or other staff outside the Office of the General Counsel, will
assume responsibility for the matter. In light of the fact that the General Counsel retains responsibility for prosecuting
Rule 2(e) proceedings against attorneys, the Commission intends that persons other than staff in the Office of the
General Counsel will provide advice concerning any such matters so long as the Office of the General Counsel prosecutes
such cases. Some minor clarifying changes in language, without substantive effect, are also being made.

The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), that this revision

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 27, Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. App. 883), provides generally that no merchandise shall
be transported by water, or by land and water, between points in the United States except in vessels built in and documented
under the laws of the United States and owned by U.S. citizens. However, the sixth proviso of the Act, as amended, provides
that upon a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to information obtained and furnished by the Secretary
of State, that a foreign nation does not restrict the transportation of certain articles between its ports by vessels
of the United States, reciprocal privileges will be accorded to vessels of that nation, and the prohibition against
transportation of those articles between points in the U. S. will not apply to its vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Act, the Customs Service has listed in &sect;4.93(b)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR
4.93(b)(1)) those nations found to extend reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States for the transportation
of empty cargo vans, empty lift vans, and empty shipping tanks. Those nations found to grant reciprocal privileges
to vessels of the United States for the transportation of equipment for use with cargo vans, lift vans, and shipping
tanks; empty barges specifically designed for carriage aboard a vessel; empty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments of international traffic; and certain stevedoring equipment and material, are listed in &sect;4.93(b)(2)
of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.93(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority to amend this section of the Customs Regulations has been delegated to the Chief, Regulations Branch.

Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 21, 1994, accompanied by a copy of a communication from the Embassy of Malta, the Department of State
advised that Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of the articles listed in the Act by vessels of the
United States between Maltese ports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of information received from the Department of State and the Embassy of Malta, it has been determined that
Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of the articles specified in section 27 of the Merchant Marine
Act of 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. App. 883), by vessels of the United States. Therefore, appropriate reciprocal privileges
are accorded to vessels of Maltese registry as of May 27, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this amendment merely implements a statutory requirement and involves a matter in which the public is not
particularly interested, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary.
Furthermore, for the same reasons, good cause exists for dispensing with a delayed effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

 This document amends the Customs Regulations by adding Italy to the list of countries whose pleasure vessels may be
issued U.S. cruising licenses. Customs has been informed that yachts used and employed exclusively as pleasure vessels
belonging to any U.S. resident are allowed to arrive at and depart from Italian ports and cruise in the waters of Italy
without being subjected to formal entry and clearance procedures. Therefore, Customs is extending reciprocal entry
and clearance procedures to Italian-flag pleasure vessels.

Section 4.94(a), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.94(a)), provides that U.S. documented vessels with a recreational
endorsement, that are used exclusively for pleasure and not engaged in any trade and that do not violate the U.S. Customs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or navigation laws, may proceed from port to port in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to foreign ports without entering and clearing, provided they have not visited a hovering vessel. However, when
returning from a foreign port or place, such pleasure vessels are required to report their arrival pursuant to &sect;4.2,
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foreign-flag yachts entering the U.S. are generally required to comply with the laws applicable to foreign vessels
arriving at, departing from, and proceeding between ports of the U.S. See, for example, &sect;433, Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(19 U.S.C. 1433). However, &sect;4.94(b), Customs Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(19 CFR 4.94(b)), provides that pleasure vessels from certain countries found to exempt U.S. pleasure vessels from
certain formal Customs procedures may be issued cruising licenses that reciprocally exempt them from similar, U.S.
formal entry and clearance procedures (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
filing manifests, obtaining permits to proceed, and paying entry and clearance fees). Then, upon arrival at each
U.S. port of entry, the masters of such licensed vessels simply report the fact of arrival to the appropriate Customs
office. Also, yachts or pleasure vessels not carrying passengers or merchandise in trade are exempt from paying tonnage
tax and light money pursuant to &sect;4.21(b)(5), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.21(b)(5)). The list of such countries
that have been granted reciprocal customs privileges is set forth at &sect;4.94(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By diplomatic note dated January 20, 1994, the Embassy of Italy, in Washington, D.C., informed the Department of State
that Italy allows U.S. yachts and other pleasure boats to arrive at and depart from Italian ports and to cruise without
payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of import duties or taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions, subject to re-exportation and certain
other conditions. By letter dated March 7, 1994, the Department of State advised the Chief, Carrier Rulings Branch,
U.S. Customs Service, that the Italian treatment of U.S. pleasure vessels in Italian waters appeared to satisfy the
conditions for reciprocal customs privileges and recommended that Italy be added to the list of countries under the
provisions of 19 CFR 4.94(b). The Director, International Trade Compliance Division, is of the opinion that satisfactory
evidence has been furnished to grant the reciprocal privileges allowed under &sect;4.94(b), effective March 11,
1994, and requested that Italy be added to the list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of countries enumerated at &sect;4.94(b).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A SIP revision was submitted by the State of Alabama on November 13, 1992, to satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B)
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) (November 15, 1990). The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine
completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51,
Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated
December 24, 1992, was sent to Mr. Richard Grusnick, Chief of the Air Division in the Alabama Department of Environmental
Management indicating the submittal was administratively complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the state must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance,
and specific source requirements detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. SIP Revision Submission. The State of Alabama submitted their emission statement regulation on November 13, 1992,
which meets the emission statement requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability
of the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements
for sources. The emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the
information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. These requirements can
be found in subpart D on page 2, of section 2, of chapter 11, in the Alabama SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Applicability. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that states with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone,
require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(Marginal, Moderate, etc.). The states may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for
classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. The Alabama submittal waives the emission statement requirement for sources
with less than 25 tons per year combined of actual plant-wide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions and has included calculations of these emissions in their 1990 Base Year Emissions Inventory.

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, EPA is approving the Emission Statement SIP revision submitted by the State of Alabama through the
ADEM. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates
no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994. However,
if adverse or critical comments are received by September 6, 1994, this action will be withdrawn and all public comments
received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed rule published,
simultaneously, in the proposal section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by (60 days from date of publication). Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce
its requirements. [See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)]. This action has been classified as a Table
2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing
in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for
a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the
impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses,
small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

 The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing the limited approval of a request by the State of New York to revise
its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone related to the control of volatile organic compound emissions from
architectural coatings. EPA is also finding that the State has partially met a commitment made in its 1982 ozone and
carbon monoxide SIP for the New York City Metropolitan Area to regulate architectural coatings. This revision deleted
part 205 (1979 version) ``Photochemically Reactive Solvents and Organic Solvents from Certain Processes-New York
City Metropolitan Area'' and added part 205 ``Architectural Surface Coatings.'' This regulation will result in
additional reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds which will help to attain the national ambient
air quality standard for ozone.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40107) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed limited approval of a request by
the State of New York to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. This revision deleted part 205 (1979
version) ``Photochemically Reactive Solvents and Organic Solvents from Certain Processes-New York City Metropolitan
Area'' and added new part 205 ``Architectural Surface Coatings,'' effective September 15, 1988 to Title 6 of the New
York Code of Rules and Regulations. EPA also proposed finding that the State has partially met a commitment made in
its 1982 ozone and carbon monoxide SIP for the New York City Metropolitan Area (NYCMA) to regulate architectural coatings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New part 205 provides for the regulation of architectural surface coatings, sold, offered for sale, or used in the
NYCMA. Architectural surface coatings applied to stationary structures, buildings, houses, mobile homes, pavement
or curbs are regulated by part 205. These coatings are not applied in a factory or manufacturing operation. The regulation
requires any architectural coating manufactured after July 1, 1989 that is to be sold, offered for sale or used in the
NYCMA to meet the designated volatile organic compound (VOC) content limitations in part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paint manufacturers must include on the container the VOC content limitations, date of manufacture or date code,
along with any instructions concerning thinning. Compliance with part 205 can be determined visually by checking
the paint containers and by taking samples of the paint and calculating the volatile content of the coating and comparing
it with the limit in the regulation. In some instances it is necessary to measure certain coating parameters. The EPA
recommended test method for determining these parameters is EPA Reference Method 24 (40 CFR part 60 Appendix A). Part
205 inadvertently omitted this reference which New York uses in performing similar testing for other regulations.
Therefore, EPA cannot fully approve the regulation. However, because EPA believes that the regulation strengthens
the SIP by providing for additional reductions of VOCs, EPA is granting a limited approval to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also finds that the State has partially fulfilled its commitment in the SIP to adopt an architectural coatings
control measure (contained in part 205). Adoption of a specific test procedure, as discussed above, is necessary
to completely fulfill this commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for EPA's limited approval is further explained in the proposed rulemaking on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40107).
In that proposed rulemaking, EPA asked for comments on its proposed action. EPA received one comment, from the Consumer
Policy Institute (CPI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPI raises three issues in its comments: the timeliness of New York's submission, the difference between the emission
reductions New York committed to and the emission reductions actually obtained, and whether New York is enforcing
the regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, CPI notes that New York has failed to meet the commitment made in its 1982 SIP in a timely manner, and questions
whether New York will further ``slip'' in meeting other SIP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York's 1982 SIP committed to develop and adopt an architectural regulation by January, 1986. New York did not meet
this date for a variety of reasons. The Clean Air Act, as revised in 1977, provided limited remedies for a state which
failed to meet Act and SIP requirements, but these were sufficient to result in New York adopting part 205 on August
15, 1988. The amendments of 1990 substantially strengthen EPA's enforcement abilities by providing specific procedures,
time frames for SIP submittals and sanctions should a state fail to submit or implement their SIPs. The sanctions which
the Act mandates are: restrictions on new growth of industries which generate air pollutants and a loss of federal
highway funds. EPA believes these new strengthened procedures and sanctions will induce the states to fulfill their
obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, CPI notes that New York committed to obtaining 11,682 tons of reductions in VOCs in its 1982 SIP, yet New York
now estimates that part 205 will only result in emission reductions of 3,000 tons per year. CPI questions how New York
will meet this commitment for equivalent tonnage reductions in VOCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This comment raises concerns regarding the level of controls that have been required and the ability of New York to
demonstrate attainment (i.e., rectify the shortfall). The Clean Air Act addresses both of these concerns. The Act
uses a fundamental concept that sources should apply reasonably available control technology (RACT), as defined
in control techniques guidelines (CTGs) or as determined by a state through a specific technical and economic review
of the industry. As EPA explained in its proposed action, New York's original emission reduction was based on 1975
data which New York believes overestimated the amount of solvent based coatings used in the NYCMA, and on which the
projected emission reductions were based. The present emission reduction estimate reflects current coating usage
and solvent content which EPA believes is more accurate. EPA also notes that New York has regulated all the high volume
coatings as well as most of the lower usage coatings that the original commitment intended. In addition, EPA has found
that New York's VOC limitations are consistent with regulations of the limited number of states that have also regulated
these coatings. Furthermore, section 183(e) of the Act requires EPA to regulate consumer products, which include
architectural coatings. EPA has a major rule development effort underway to develop a national architectural coatings
regulation that will provide more extensive and current data on coating content and usage. Once this data is available,
New York will be able to reevaluate its rule to determine if additional reductions are achievable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of New York's ability to reach attainment, Congress, in recognizing that many states, including New York
were having problems solving their air pollution problems, set forth a procedure for states to follow in the Act as
amended in 1990. This procedure consists of requirements to develop accurate current emission inventories that
can be used in selecting control strategies, to adopt specific control measures, to develop reasonable further progress
plans, and to develop any additional control measures needed to attain the standard by the specified dates. These
requirements will address any shortfalls that remain from the previously approved SIP and insure that states, like
New York, attain the ozone standard in an expeditious manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, CPI raises its concern that, while New York State has adopted the regulation, it may not actually be enforcing
it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 205 contains labeling requirements with which manufacturers of architectural coatings must comply. This provides
a quick method of screening the coatings being sold. In addition, after the regulation became effective, New York
State performed random checks of retail stores to ensure that only compliant coatings were being sold. New York has
continued to take action to ensure that retailers and manufacturers are complying with part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, by incorporating this regulation into New York's SIP, it becomes federally enforceable. Thus EPA has
the authority to take enforcement action should EPA determine there is any lack of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has reviewed New York's request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those
requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. The revision incorporates
a control program consistent to the one committed to in the 1982 SIP and results in emission reductions. Therefore,
New York's submittal meets the requirements of section 193. Beyond that, the revision will not interfere with the
SIP's ability to meet the new Act's requirements, and thus it meets the test in section 110(i) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of a missing test method, EPA cannot grant full approval to this regulation under section 110(k)(3). Because
the submitted regulation is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements of the Act,
EPA cannot grant partial approval for the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant limited approval of
the submittal under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations
necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also finds that the State has partially fulfilled its commitment in the SIP to adopt an architectural coatings
control measure (contained in part 205). Adoption of the missing test procedure, as discussed above, is necessary
to fulfill this commitment in whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 183(e)(3) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA develop either national regulations or CTG for consumer and
commercial products, which may include architectural coatings. If EPA promulgates a federal regulation for architectural
coatings under this authority, then sources covered by New York's part 205 would also be required to comply with the
federal regulation. New York does retain the right to promulgate regulations that are more stringent than either
a federal regulation or a CTG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is approving a February 11, 1993, State submittal requesting
a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). The revision pertains to a site-specific
emission limit for an iron foundry operated by General Motors Corporation (GMC) and located adjacent to Interstate
74 at G Street in Vermilion County, Illinois. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment''
for carbon monoxide. In the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

On October 1, 1992, the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) adopted a Final Opinion and Order amending Title 35:
Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution Chapter I: Pollution Control Board (35 IAC) section 216.381
revising the allowable emission limit of gases containing CO from 200 ppm to 2,000 ppm for the GMC iron foundry in Vermilion
County, Illinois.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The GMC foundry manufactures iron castings for the automotive industry. The castings include brake drums, bearing
caps, differential carriers, water pumps and brake rotors. The foundry is located approximately 1.5 miles from downtown
Danville adjacent to Interstate 74 at G Street, in an area that is predominately agricultural, with some residential
sections. This is the only iron foundry in Vermilion County. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment''
of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO (Refer to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations &sect;81.314,
1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GMC foundry is presently using two cupolas, Number 2 and Number 3, in its foundry operation. A cupola is a vertical
shaft furnace which is fed or ``charged'' with layers of metallics, coke and limestone. Cupola melting is used by GMC
to melt scrap metal. Approximately 220,000 tons of scrap metal are remelted and made into castings each year. Typical
cupola exhaust gases contain 13 to 27 percent CO. This is the equivalent of 130,000 to 270,000 parts per million (ppm).
In a cupola, high CO levels and specific carbon dioxide ratios are important to the metallurgical properties of the
iron. These levels can be minimized by proper selection of fuels, charge material, and by major facility changes,
but cannot be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1988, emission tests of the cupolas showed CO emissions from both cupolas were in excess of 200 ppm. CO was present
at a concentration of 8,317 ppm for Cupola Number 3 and at 4,563 ppm for Cupola Number 2. Subsequent tests showed CO concentrations
as high as 16,053 ppm for Cupola Number 3. As a result of these tests, GMC initiated an aggressive plan to modify the system
beyond the state-of-the art contemplated by the regulation. In November 1988, GMC filed a petition for a variance
in order to continue the operation of the foundry while it implemented corrective action to reduce the concentration
of CO in its emissions. Although modifications have significantly reduced emissions, compliance with the 200 ppm
limitation has not been achieved. However, emissions have dropped from a high concentration of approximately 18,000
ppm to below 2,000 ppm. A computer modeling study discussed below demonstrated that CO emissions at the rate of 2,000
ppm would not adversely affect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The purpose of this source specific
SIP revision request is to permanently amend GMC's allowable emission limit of gases containing CO from 200 ppm to
2,000 ppm for this iron foundry.

II. Analysis of State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As previously stated, the IPCB has adopted a site-specific regulation revising the allowable emission limit of CO
from GMC cupolas in Vermilion County from 200 ppm to 2,000 ppm. The new language reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
The standard for CO for 35 IAC 216.381 shall not apply to the existing foundry located adjacent to Interstate 74 at G
street in Vermilion County, owned by GMC on the effective date of this regulation. The emission of carbon monoxide
from this foundry shall not exceed 2,000 ppm corrected to 50 percent excess air.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board of the Illinois
Administrative Code (35 IAC) Part 216_Carbon Monoxide Emissions, contains the regulations regarding this SIP revision
request. Section 216.101_Measurement Methods, contains measurement methods applicable to GMC's site-specific
SIP revision request. This section states that carbon monoxide concentrations in an effluent stream shall be measured
by the non-dispersive infrared method or by other methods approved by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA) according to the provisions of 35 IAC 201.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA had concerns about the test method and recordkeeping for this source. Specifically the test methods and
recordkeeping requirements relied on in this requested SIP revision were not sufficient to ensure compliance with
the limit and maintenance of the CO NAAQS. Further, because section 216.201 allows IEPA to modify the test methods
utilized and because case law indicates that such State discretionary actions modify the SIP without Federal comment
or approval USEPA would be required to disapprove this requested SIP revision since the possibility of modification
without Federal approval would impede attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. (See for example

Allsteel Inc.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(No. 87C4638 ND Illinois, August 30, 1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA would ordinarily propose to disapprove this site-specific regulation and recommend that the State modify
the regulations in the requested SIP revision to incorporate the appropriate test methods, recordkeeping and reporting
requirements and to remove the discretionary provisions or at least to limit their effectiveness until they were
approved as a SIP revision by USEPA. However, on December 17, 1992 (57 FR59928) Illinois' operating permit program
was approved by USEPA and incorporated into the SIP for the purpose of issuing Federally Enforceable State Operating
Permits (FESOP). As operating permits issued following the approved State requirements are federally enforceable,
Illinois addressed USEPA's concerns by including adequate test methods and recordkeeping requirements as discussed
in section 3 in a FESOP for the GMC iron foundry.

The USEPA reviewed the dispersion modeling analysis performed by Versar Incorporated for this SIP revision request
and has determined that the analysis is acceptable as a demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for
CO. This attainment and maintenance demonstration was performed in accordance with USEPA guidance.

III. Final Rulemaking Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA approves the February 11, 1993, submittal as a revision to the Illinois CO SIP for the GMC iron foundry in Vermilion
County amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35 IAC section 216.381 because the deficiencies identified were corrected in a FESOP issued to the Source. Vermilion
County is and has always been designated as attainment for CO and ozone and the emission limit set forth in the SIP revision
was shown through the modeling analysis not to cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS for CO. Because the State
included the following conditions in a FESOP, the SIP revision is now federally enforceable upon the effective date
of this action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Specific test method to be used;

2. Identification as to whether a continuous or integrated sample is to be used in the test method;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A compliance test that contains averaging times; and

4. The appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements to insure compliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This
action will become effective on October 3, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by September 6, 1994,
then the USEPA will publish a notice that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received in response
to this final rule in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed
rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The comment period will not be extended or reopened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it
rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 4, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 15689) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of New Jersey for its Emission Statement Program. The SIP revision was submitted to satisfy Section 182(a)
of the Clean Air Act which requires stationary sources to report on an annual basis their emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for EPA's proposed approval was explained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and will not be restated
here since EPA's final action does not differ from the proposed action. EPA inadvertently omitted reference in the
Proposed Rulemaking to Subchapter 1, ``General Provisions''; Subchapter 8, ``Permits and Certificates, Hearings,
and Confidentiality''; and Subchapter 16, ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic Compounds,''
but will take action on the changes made to these subchapters in a subsequent rulemaking. No public comments were received
on the proposed action. Therefore, EPA is approving New Jersey's SIP revision incorporating Subchapter 21, ``Emission
Statements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15689, April 4, 1994. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received
no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 20, 1993. The revisions concern rules from the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD).
This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving
these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from hospital sterilizers
and petroleum production, processing, storage, and transfer. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions
into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary
and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 20, 1993 in 58 FR 66324, EPA proposed to approve the following VCAPCD rules into the California SIP: Rule
62.6, Ethylene Oxide-Sterilization and Aeration; Rule 71.1, Crude Oil Production and Separation; and Rule 71.3,
Transfer of Reactive Organic Compound Liquids. These rules were adopted by VCAPCD on July 16, 1991 and June 16, 1992.
The rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on October 25, 1991 and September 14, 1992.
These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment
areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that
interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above
rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 58 FR 66324 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office.

EPA Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing this action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the
submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval
action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules
is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 12, 1994. The revisions concern a rule from the Sacramento Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD). This
rule is intended to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from degreasing (cleaning) operations. This
final action notice will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving
this rule is to regulate VOC emissions in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA
or the Act). Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of this revision into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA
regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and
plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 22, 1991, the sanctions and FIP clocks were started when EPA determined that the State failed to make a complete
submittal. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on April 28, 1993 when EPA determined that the State had made
a complete submittal. This final action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP and stop the Federal
Implementation Plan clock.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 12, 1994 in 59 FR 1699, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SMAQMD's Rule
454, Degreasing Operations. Rule 454 was adopted by SMAQMD on February 23, 1993. This rule was submitted in response
to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably
available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements
of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for the above rule and nonattainment area is provided
in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above.
EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 1698 and in a technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region IX office
(TSD dated June 10, 1993 for Rule 454).

Response to Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 1698. No comments were received by EPA on the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rule for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal
under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval action will
incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions
of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP and also stop the Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP) clock. The sanctions and FIP clocks were started on October 22, 1991 when EPA determined that the State failed
to make a complete submittal. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on April 28, 1993 when EPA determined that
the State made a complete submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 12, 1992, the State of Tennessee through the Memphis and Shelby County Health Department (MSCHD), submitted
a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Memphis and Shelby County area (classified as a marginal nonattainment
area) from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area specifically consists of Shelby County. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed
if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes and the redesignation request satisfies the criteria set
forth in the Clean Air Act for redesignations. In this action, EPA is approving the State of Tennessee's submittal
because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become
a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Memphis and Shelby County area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 15, 1993, in a letter from Patrick M. Tobin to Governor Ned McWherter, the EPA notified the State of Tennessee
that the EPA had made a finding of failure to submit required programs for the nonattainment area. EPA's redesignation
of the Memphis and Shelby County area to attainment abrogates those requirements for this area. Therefore, the sanctions
and federal implementation plan clocks begun by those findings are stopped at the time of the redesignation.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of Tennessee,
EPA designated the Memphis and Shelby County area as nonattainment because the area violated the O

area was classified as marginal under section 181(a)(1). (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992),

III. Review of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 19, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the MSCHD constituted a complete redesignation
request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes
of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify
when the MSCHD first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous
policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the CAA, including redesignation submittals,
would not be determined complete. See the memorandum entitled ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted
in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines'' from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X,
dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception
to the completeness criteria (40 CFR 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for
mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3&hyph;4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory
submittals under the CAA, EPA believed it appropriate to change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals
to conform to the existing completeness criteria. (See 58 FR 38108 (July 15, 1993)). Therefore, EPA believes, the
parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals,
at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception. MSCHD submitted a redesignation request on November
12, 1992. In the November 12 submittal, MSCHD submitted the maintenance plan, thereby including the final element
to make the November 12, 1992, request for parallel processing complete under the parallel processing exception
to the completeness criteria. When the maintenance plan became state effective on March 9, 1994, the State of Tennessee
no longer needed parallel processing for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tennessee redesignation request for the Memphis and Shelby County area meets the five requirements of section
107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the State of Tennessee
has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation
request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Tennessee's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which
is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar
year 1989 through calendar year 1992 show an expected exceedance rate of less than or equal to 1.0 per year of the O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Memphis and Shelby County area. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) One of the two ozone monitoring sites had
no exceedances over this period of time while the other monitor had one exceedance. That exceedance occurred in 1989.
The design value, or the ``fourth highest high,'' of the two monitors for the calendar year period of 1990 through 1992
was 0.117 ppm, down from 0.140 ppm in the period of calendar year 1988 through calendar year 1990, and 0.121 ppm for the
calendar year period of 1989 through 1991. The ozone monitoring year for 1993 ended on October 31, 1993. One monitor
recorded an exceedance of the 0.120 ppm NAAQS during the 1993 season. The State of Tennessee has committed to continue
monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR 58. Because the Memphis and Shelby County area has complete quality-assured
data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Memphis
and Shelby County area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the O

2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 6, 1980, and on September 2, 1981, EPA fully approved Tennessee's SIP as meeting the requirements of section
110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 26038 and 45 FR 59578). The amended CAA, however, revised section 110(a)(2)
and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes
of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed
the Tennessee SIP to ensure that it contained all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the State
of Tennessee submitted its redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Section 110 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 110 was amended, the Memphis and Shelby County area SIP meets the requirements of amended section
110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment
SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 57 FR 27939 (June 23, 1992),
many are duplicative of other requirements of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent
with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).

Before the Memphis and Shelby County area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable
requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject.
Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified
as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Memphis and Shelby County area is classified
as marginal (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.334). The State of Tennessee submitted their request for redesignation
of the Memphis and Shelby County area prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment,
the State of Tennessee must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c)
and 176, and the requirements of subpart 2 of part D, which became due on or before November 12, 1992, the date the State
submitted a complete redesignation request. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean that, for a redesignation
request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that became applicable to the subject area prior to
or at the time of the submission of the redesignation request. Requirements of the CAA that come due subsequent to the
submission of the redesignation request continue to be applicable to the area (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the
section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after
an area is designated as nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements were applicable to classified

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1992, the date that the State of Tennessee submitted a complete redesignation
request for the Memphis and Shelby County area. Therefore, the State of Tennessee was not required to meet these requirements
for purposes of redesignation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon redesignation of this area to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained
in part C of title I are applicable. On June 24, 1982, the EPA approved the State of Tennessee's PSD program (47 FR 27269).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Plan Provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement
to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under
Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other federal actions
(``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by states
must be consistent with federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided
for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's ``General Preamble for the Implementation of title I'' informed
states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both
transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance
plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section
51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Tennessee is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation
conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly,
Tennessee is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent
with those established in the federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not
yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval
of this redesignation request.

SIPs. Tennessee submitted the VOC RACT fixups for purposes of redesignating the Memphis and Shelby County area. These
were published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas on November 15, 1992, such as VOC RACT catch-ups, Gasoline Vapor Recovery, New Source Review,
and Emission Statements. Tennessee failed to submit these measures for the Memphis and Shelby County area. On January
15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit these measures by letter from Patrick M. Tobin, Acting Regional Administrator,
to Ned McWherter, Governor of Tennessee. However these requirements are not applicable for purposes of considering
the State's redesignation request. For purposes of redesignation, EPA must consider whether the State has met all
requirements that were applicable prior to the time the state submitted the redesignation request. Since Tennessee
submitted the redesignation request for Memphis and Shelby County on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 12, 1992, these measures are not relevant for purposes of redesignation. Therefore, all subpart 2 requirements
that were applicable at the time the State submitted its redesignation request have been met. The VOC RACT fixups and
the Alternate Emission Standards were published in the

Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended
CAA, EPA has determined that the Memphis and Shelby County area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which
also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. The State of Tennessee believes that the predominance of the emission reductions that have occurred, as demonstrated
by a comparison of previous emission inventories versus the 1990 base year emission inventory that was presented
in their supplemental submittal of March 31, 1994 (as attachment E), that air quality has been improved in the Memphis
and Shelby County area as a result of permanent and enforceable emission reductions through local, state and federal
programs. Of significance are emission reductions of point source VOC's from 49,000 tons per year (tpy) in 1979, to
27,633 tpy in 1983, to 14,986 tpy in 1990. The VOC reductions that have occurred are the result of several factors. These
include federal emission limitations and fleet turnover, the Memphis vehicle inspection and maintenance (I&amp;M)
program to enforce the federal limitations and the implementation and enforcement of Shelby County regulations
concerning the construction and operation of VOC emitting sources. These sources are regulated as they relate to
new source requirements for best available control technology (BACT), lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) technology
and offsets, and to existing source requirements calling for the installation of reasonably available control technology
(RACT). The I&amp;M program has been in operation since the mid-1980's and has been improved in its operation from
a quality standpoint since that time. The Savings Clause For Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance [CAA section 187(a)(4)]
insures, at a minimum, the continuation of I&amp;M in the current configuration. Air pollution regulations have
been in existence, in large part, since the 1970's and early 1980's with continued amendments and improvements since
that time. Projections indicate that VOC emissions will not exceed the 1990 baseline inventory before the year 2005.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reductions have occurred while Memphis has continued to pursue, expand and enhance accountability of sources
both in quality and quantity. Also of significance are reductions in mobile source emissions which may not be readily
apparent from comparisons of the different inventories. Road projects that make up the Transportation Improvement
Plan (TIP) must have a positive impact on air quality. These projects, including some outlying area signal improvements,
a Suburban Transit Center program for the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) and a Land Use/Transportation Systems
Integration Study, should provide some measure for reduction to the mobile source emission inventory. Finally,
road construction or improvement projects, in order to meet conformity requirements, must provide a positive effect
on air quality. The contribution of these projects to air quality is evaluated by computer modelling using MOBILE5A.
This will be quantified annually in the conformity process for TIP approval. However, allowing for the increased
vehicle population and increased vehicle miles travelled, strides have been made in reducing vehicular emissions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State of Tennessee has demonstrated that actual
enforceable emission reductions are responsible for the recent air quality improvement and that the VOC emissions
in the base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the State must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.

, and CO emissions from the Memphis and Shelby County area. The inventories included biogenic, area, stationary,
and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory is
considered representative of attainment conditions because the NAAQS was not violated during 1990. The 1990 Base
Year Emission Inventory for point sources for the Memphis and Shelby County area has been submitted to EPA in SIP Air
Pollutant Inventory Management Subsystem (SAMS) format. The remaining data has been submitted in tabular format.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Tennessee submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by source location and source
category. This comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the SAMS format. Finally, this inventory
was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories
is shown in the following three tables. The CO and the biogenic VOC values are included as a part of the 1990 base year
emission inventory. This notice is approving the base year inventory. Refer to the TSD prepared for this notice for

, and CO emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to 2004. These projected inventories were prepared in
accordance with EPA guidance. Refer to EPA's TSD prepared for this notice for more in-depth details regarding the
projected inventory for the Memphis and Shelby County area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1994, the State of Tennessee submitted supplemental projection inventories. The data submitted for
1993 showed a higher level of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions than the base year, however, the Memphis/Shelby County nonattainment area was still in attainment during
1993. All following years' data is below the 1993 level, therefore, continued attainment is expected. The projected
emissions for 1993 closely approximate actual 1993 data. The NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels projected for 1996 and 1999, although higher than the base year levels, are significantly lower than the 1993
levels, which, as noted above, did not cause a violation of the standard. The levels for 2002 and 2004 projected as less
than the attainment year. Although approval of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increases above a de minimis level is a departure from EPA guidance, EPA believes that the emissions projections demonstrate
that the area will continue to maintain the O

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Memphis and Shelby County area depends, in part, on the State of Tennessee's efforts toward tracking indicators
of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The Memphis and Shelby County area will utilize the several
plan elements to maintain current acceptable ozone levels. The air quality monitoring network will continue to operate
in accordance with 40 CFR Part 58, with no reductions to the existing monitoring network. Any relocation of monitors
will be agreed upon by the EPA prior to their relocation. Existing stationary source control will continue. Additional
companies subject to RACT regulations will be added to the source listing, and will be required to comply with emission
standards. Sources wishing to locate in Shelby County will continue to undergo new source review requirements to
include the installation of best available control technology. A triennial emissions inventory will be performed
to include area, mobile and point sources of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. This inventory will
be developed in conjunction with emission inventories for Carbon Monoxide. The first year for inclusion as an inventory
year is 1993, with said inventory to be accomplished by December 31, 1994 and submitted for approval to the State of
Tennessee by January 31, 1995. Successive inventories are to be accomplished using the same procedure. When the triennial
inventory exceeds the projected inventory by more than ten percent, then the inventory development will be increased
to an annual event. Inspection and Maintenance (I &amp; M) of the automobile will continue in the City of Memphis with
an increased emphasis on enforcement to assure vehicle owner participation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the future. Despite the State's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient
air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, the State of Tennessee has provided contingency
measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 air quality problem. The State of Tennessee's contingency plan is triggered by a violation of the Ozone NAAQS of 0.12
ppm that occurs after redesignation to attainment. Plan implementation would begin upon confirmation of an ozone
violation. The plan contains a contingency to implement pre-adopted additional control measures such as Reasonable
Available Control Technology (RACT) level control for not previously controlled VOC sources. Development of requirements
to lower emissions of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from stationary fuel burning sources would also begin immediately. These pre-adopted additional measures for RACT
will be implemented within 90 days of the date the State certifies to EPA that the air quality data which demonstrates
a violation of the O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regulations would be implemented within two years of the ozone violation. A complete description of these contingency
measures and their triggers can be found in the TSD prepared for this notice. EPA finds that the contingency measures
provided in the State of Tennessee submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA.

E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the State of Tennessee has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP
eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional
ten years.

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final action, EPA is approving the Memphis and Shelby County O

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 maintenance plan, including the 1990 base year emission inventory, because it meets the requirements of section
175A. In addition, the EPA is redesignating the Memphis and Shelby County area to attainment for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the State of Tennessee has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation.
This action stops the sanctions and federal implementation plan clocks that were triggered for the Memphis and Shelby
County area by the January 15, 1993, findings letter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective October 3, 1994 unless, within 30 days of its publication, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements
on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any
regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request
will not affect a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 3, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).)

dated October 4, 1993. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions
(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Prior to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments the parabolic shaped area of Tacoma extending approximately 31/2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
miles SSW from the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) Plant was designated nonattainment for sulfur
dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) in relation to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). 43 FR 9043 (March 3, 1978). The primary source
of the pollutant in the Tacoma area was the ASARCO copper smelter, emitting an average of 100 tons of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 per year. On August 6, 1979, based on a stipulated agreement between EPA and ASARCO which was entered in the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 78&hyph;1929), EPA proposed redesignation of Tacoma from nonattainment
to unclassifiable for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (44 FR 45970). EPA revoked the nonattainment designation on November 30, 1979 (44 FR 68834). The redesignation was
intended to defer the requirement for a Part D (Plan Requirements for Nonattainment Areas) SIP revision. Part D of
the CAA requires an applicable implementation plan within 18 months of the designation to nonattainment. The redesignation
to unclassifiable allowed EPA to complete rulemaking action under Section 123 of the Act which would allow the use
of meteorological curtailment programs to meet ambient air quality standards if the program was in place before 1970.
The final rules interpreting Section 123 were published by EPA on April 2, 1986. Through that publication, EPA met
the terms of the settlement agreement and was qualified to redesignate Tacoma under Section 107 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 22, 1993, the State of Washington, on behalf of the Governor, submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator
a request to redesignate the Tacoma area from unclassifiable to attainment. The CAA does not set forth specific requirements
for areas seeking redesignation from unclassifiable to attainment. However, the CAA provides that an attainment
area is an area that meets the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for a specific pollutant and does not contribute
to poor air quality in a nearby area that does not meet the NAAQS for that pollutant. Therefore, at a minimum, an area
needs to meet the NAAQS in order to be redesignated from unclassifiable to attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ambient air quality monitoring from 1980 through 1993 shows attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Tacoma area. The National Air Monitor System (NAMS) and State/Local Air Monitor System (SLAM) monitoring
locations changed throughout the 11 years. The NAMS locations include 54th Ave NE, Alexander Ave, 26th and Pearl,
Mt Tacoma High School, and Benny's Nursery. Moreover, the state and local standards for air quality are more stringent
than the NAAQS, and exceedances have not been recorded for either of these standards since the ASARCO copper smelter
plant ceased operation as of March 1984. Therefore, EPA has determined that the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Tacoma area has been attained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is further assured that the area will remain in attainment because the ASARCO Copper Smelter, the primary source
of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, permanently ceased operations in March 1984. ASARCO's permanent closure is strengthened by the stack
demolition that occurred on January 17, 1993. After the copper smelter ceased operation there was a considerable
decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions, as indicated by the continuing emission monitoring of the Tacoma area.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA, in this action, is redesignating Tacoma from unclassifiable to attainment for sulfur dioxide. This action is
being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial, the State has demonstrated that the
area has attained the standard and that the primary source of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions has permanently ceased operation. Therefore, EPA anticipates no adverse comments on this action.

III. Administrative Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective October 3, 1994 unless, within 30 days of its publication, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any
parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public
is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms
with those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 3, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).

 This order partially revokes an Executive order insofar as it affects 640 acres of National Forest System land withdrawn
for the Bureau of Land Management's Coal Reserve Montana No. 1. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which
it was withdrawn. The revocation is needed to finalize the Forest Service exchange provided for in Public Law 103&hyph;91,
which mandated that the exchange be completed and clear title issued. This action will open the land to surface entry
and mining. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing.

The Commission has amended its rules regarding the appointment of the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) and
the Alternate Designated Agency Ethics Official (ADEO). Personnel in the Office of General Counsel have been designated
to be the DAEO and ADEO. This change will consolidate management of the ethics program established by the February
3, 1993 regulations of the Office of Government Ethics that established new uniform standards of ethical conduct
for officers and employers of the executive branch of the Federal Government.

In the matter of: Amendment of Parts 0 and 19 of the Commission's Rules of Commission Organization and Governing Employee
Standards of Ethical Conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adopted: July 20, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
By the Commission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On February 3, 1993, regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that establish new uniform standards
of ethical conduct for officers and employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government became effective.
See 5 CFR 2635, 57 FR 35006 August 7, (1992).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 OGE regulations also require the Commission to formally designate an agency official to be the ``designated agency
ethics official'' or ``DAEO'' to coordinate and manage the Commission's ethics program. In addition, these regulations
require the agency to appoint an alternate DAEO or ``ADAEO'' to serve in an acting capacity in the absence of the primary
designated agency ethics official. See 5 CFR 2638.201&hyph;2638.202. The purpose of this Order is to designate personnel
in the Office of General Counsel to those positions and to make the necessary changes in the Commission's rules to effect
that designation. Specifically, this Order delegates authority to the General Counsel to assume the responsibilities
of the DAEO and to implement the ethics program established in the new OGE regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the scheme established in the new OGC regulations, most of the Commission's existing Part 19 rules have been
superseded by OGE'S regulations. We will restructure Part 19 to remove the superseded sections and to renumber the
provisions that may be retained in accordance with the OGE regulations in a future order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
2. Under the OGE regulations, the DAEO is required to be qualified to counsel agency personnel concerning the new OGE
ethics standards and to counsel departing and former agency officials on post-employment conflict of interest standards.
5 CFR 2638.202(b)(3)&hyph;(4). In addition, the DAEO has responsibility for managing the agency's ethics program,
including liaison with OGE, reviewing financial disclosure reports, monitoring ethics training, and monitoring
administrative actions and sanctions. The DAEO may appoint ``deputy'' ethics officials to perform any of these functions,
but such deputies work under the DAEO's supervision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 CFR 2638.204.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Under current Commission rules, the General Counsel has broad delegated authority to provide ethics counseling,
and other duties that are very similar to the principal functions performed by the DAEO under OGE's regulations. Specifically,
the General Counsel now has overall delegated authority to act as ``legal counselor for the Commission to provide
guidance on matters relating to ethical conduct,'' and to serve as the ``Commission's designee to the Office of Personnel
Management'' on matters covered by the OPM (now OGE) rules governing ethical conduct. 47 CFR 19.735&hyph;105(a)(1).
In fact, most of the responsibilities set forth in the OGE regulations, with the exception of the management of the
financial disclosure statements, are already delegated to the Commission's General Counsel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Commission rules give the Chief, Operations Support Division authority to serve as the designated agency
ethics official for the purpose of receiving, reviewing and certifying financial disclosure statements. See 47
CFR 0.231(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our informal survey of other agencies also indicates that designating the senior legal official as the DAEO is consistent
with the general practice of agencies of similar size. In light of these factors, we think it is appropriate to designate
the General Counsel as the DAEO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accordingly we shall add a new &sect;0.251(a) to delegate authority to the General Counsel to act as the ``designated
agency ethics official.'' The rule will delegate authority to the Associate General Counsel for Administrative
Law to act as the ``alternate designated agency ethics official.''

, the Commission adopts a multiplier for use to determine whether interests in cellular and broadband PCS licensees
held indirectly through intervening corporate entities should be attributed for purposes of the Commission's broadband
PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. This action is taken so that these rules can
be more effectively enforced consistent with their intent, which is to ensure that broadband PCS licensees lack any
incentive to impede the development of full competition with the cellular licensees or with other broadband PCS licensees
in the same geographic area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding, FCC 94&hyph;144, 59 FR 32830 (June 24, 1994) (``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
''), we reaffirmed our bright-line cross-ownership attribution standards, which apply to common ownership of licenses
in the Domestic Public Cellular Radio Telecommunications Service (``cellular'') and the Personal Communications
Services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''). We also ruled that no entity would be permitted to hold broadband PCS
licenses comprising more than 40 MHz of spectrum in a particular PCS service area. The purpose of both the broadband
PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and the broadband PCS spectrum cap rule is to ensure that broadband PCS licensees
lack any incentive to impede the development of full competition with the cellular licensees or with other broadband
PCS licensees in the same geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We determined that an interest of 20 percent or more in a cellular license will be attributable,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and that an interest of 5 percent or more in a broadband PCS license will be attributable. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;&para;109&hyph;110. Under the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule, entities with attributable
ownership of a cellular license covering 10 percent or more of the population of a broadband PCS service area are limited
to holding one 10 MHz broadband PCS license in that broadband PCS service area until January 1, 2000. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 24.204. Under the broadband PCS spectrum cap rule, parties are not permitted to hold attributable interests
in licenses covering more than 40 MHz in the same PCS service area. See 47 CFR 24.229(c). In determining how to calculate
a party's interest in a cellular licensee when it is held through multiple tiers of entities, we stated that the interest
of a subsidiary is attributed in full to the parent. See

3. Herein we reconsider, on our own motion, the issue of whether to use a ``multiplier'' to determine how interests
in cellular and broadband PCS licensees held indirectly through intervening corporate entities should be attributed.
A multiplier is currently used by the Commission in our attribution rules in the broadcast context. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 73.3555, note 2(d). To determine the ``true'' ownership interest of a party whose interest in a broadcast licensee
is held through intervening entities, each non-majority, non-controlling interest is multiplied together. For
example, a party that owns a 25 percent non-controlling interest in a corporation that has a 10 percent non-controlling
interest in a licensee would be deemed to have a 2.5 percent interest in the licensee. As we concluded in adopting a multiplier
for broadcast attribution, use of a multiplier allows the Commission to accurately take account of a party's ``actual
involvement with the ultimate licensee'' as well as its ability to exert control over the actions of the licensee.

, 1 FCC Red 802 (1986), 52 FR 1630 (Jan. 15, 1987). We concluded that ``use of a multiplier would more realistically reflect
a party's attenuated interest in a licensee where there are intervening corporations, than does the present practice
of fully attributing any interest above the benchmark through each intervening corporation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we favored a bright-line test because we believed that it would result in a faster, less burdensome licensing process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para; 113. On reconsideration, however, we have concluded that adding use of a multiplier will allow us to more
effectively enforce the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership and broadband PCS spectrum cap rules consistent
with their intent. We also conclude that using a multiplier is consistent with our policy goal of promoting full competition
in wireless markets, because it will not cause the exclusion of firms that pose no threat to competition. Without a
multiplier, parties that have neither the ability to exert control nor a substantial financial stake in the cellular
or broadband PCS license could be unduly restricted in acquiring interests in such license. Furthermore, absent
a multiplier, anomalous and unintended results occur. For example, if Company A holds a 21 percent non-controlling
interest in Company B, which in turn holds a 30 percent non-controlling interest in Company X, a cellular licensee,
Company A's attributable interest in Company X would be deemed to be 30 percent, in excess of the 20 percent threshold
applicable to broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership. Company A would thus be limited to acquiring a 10 MHz broadband
PCS license in Company X's cellular service area, even though it has neither the ability to exert control or significant
influence over the operations of Company X's cellular system nor a financial stake in Company X so substantial as to
give rise to an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct. In comparison, by using a multiplier, Company A's
attributable interest in Company X would be 6.3 percent (0.21&times;0.3), under the 20 percent attribution threshold,
and Company A would not be restricted to 10 MHz broadband PCS licenses in Company X's cellular service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Considerations of ``actual involvement'' with, true economic interest in, and ability to control a licensee are
crucial in determining whether a particular indirect ownership interest should be attributed to the holder for purposes
of our cross-ownership and multiple ownership rules. These considerations apply with equal force in the broadcast,
broadband PCS and cellular contexts; thus, we conclude that a multiplier similar to that used in applying our attribution
rules in the broadcast area should be adopted for purposes of determining attributable interests in cellular and
broadband PCS licensees. We therefore will amend &sect;24.204 of our Rules to include use of a multiplier to determine
whether an entity holding indirect non-controlling interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant
or licensee has an attributable interest for purposes of our broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and our
broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. For purposes of applying the multiplier, where an entity's ownership interest in
any particular link in the ownership chain is greater than 50 percent or is controlling, the interest will be treated
as if it were 100 percent.

(viii) Ownership interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant or licensee that are held indirectly
by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the
ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain
exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. [For example,
if A owns 10 percent of Company X, which owns 35 percent of, and controls, Company Y, which owns 25 percent of Licensee,
then Company X's attributable interest in Licensee would be 25 percent, and A's attributable interest in Licensee
would be 2.5 percent (0.1&times;0.25).]

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the TAC for thornyhead rockfish in the GOA was established by the
final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1,180 metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(3), that the TAC for thornyhead
rockfish in the GOA has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of thornyhead rockfish in
the GOA be treated as prohibited species in accordance with &sect;672.20(e), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t. August
1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is promulgating a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under the mandatory sanctions
provision of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended, after EPA makes a finding of failure specific to any State implementation
plan (SIP) or plan revision required under the Act's nonattainment area provisions. This final rule provides that
the offset sanction shall apply in an area 18 months after the date on which EPA makes such a finding with regard to that
area and that the highway sanctions shall apply in that area 6 months following application of the offset sanction.
Once this rule is effective, sanctions will apply automatically in the sequence prescribed in all instances in which
sanctions are required following applicable findings that EPA has already made or that EPA will make in the future,
except when EPA determines through a separate rulemaking to change the sanction sequence for one or more specific
circumstances. The public will have an opportunity to comment on any such separate rulemaking.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1, 1993, EPA proposed a rule (58 FR 51270) governing the sequence of mandatory sanctions under section 179(a)
(42 U.S.C. 7509(a)) of the amended Act. The document included extensive background on the Act, some of which is briefly
resummarized in this background section because it relates directly to the Act's sanction provisions. The information
not repeated concerns the overview at pages 51270&hyph;2 of the proposal provided on the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (1990 Amendments), title I requirements of the Act, and EPA action on SIP's. This background section also summarizes
the proposal and the rationale.

1. Section 179(a) Scope and Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments revised the law concerning sanctions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to address State failures to comply with the requirements of the Act. Under section 179(a) of the Act, for any plan or
plan revision required under part D of title I or required in response to a finding of substantial SIP inadequacy under
section 110(k)(5) (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(5)),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Act sets forth four findings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that EPA can make, which may lead to the application of one or both of the sanctions specified under section 179(b) (42
U.S.C. 7509(b)). The four findings are: (1) A finding under section 179(a)(1) that a State has failed, for a nonattainment
area, to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP, or that a submitted SIP or SIP element fails to meet the completeness criteria
established pursuant to section 110(k) (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)); (2) a finding under section 179(a)(2) where EPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on its failure to meet one or more plan elements required by the Act;
(3) a finding under section 179(a)(3) that the State has not made any other submission required by the Act (including
an adequate maintenance plan) or has made any other submission that fails to meet the completeness criteria or has
made a required submission that is disapproved by EPA for not meeting the Act's requirements; or (4) a finding under
section 179(a)(4) that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments also revised the Act's provisions concerning Federal implementation plans (FIP's). Under section
110(c)(1), the FIP requirement is triggered by an EPA finding that a State has failed to make a required submittal or
that a received submittal does not satisfy the minimum completeness criteria established under section 110(k)(1)(A),
or an EPA disapproval of a SIP submittal in whole or in part. However, since FIP's are not the subject of this notice,
these provisions are not addressed here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5)_known as a ``SIP call''_is made whenever EPA finds that
a plan for any area is substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant national ambient air quality standard
(NAAQS).

Section 179(a) refers to findings, disapprovals, and determinations. These will all be referred to by the one term
``findings.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA makes section 179(a) findings of failure to submit and findings of incompleteness via letters from EPA Regional
Administrators to State governors or other State officers to whom authority has been delegated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The letter itself triggers the sanctions clock. To make findings of failure to submit and findings of incompleteness
under section 179(a)(1) and section 179(a)(3)(A), EPA is not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

clock. For section 179(a)(4) findings of nonimplementation, the sanctions clock starts when EPA makes a finding
of nonimplementation in the

2. Section 179(b) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(b), two sanctions are available for selection by EPA following a section 179(a) finding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One available sanction is a restriction on highway funding, as provided in section 179(b)(1) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1)),
which is discussed in the proposal at pages 51273&hyph;51274. The other available sanction is the offset sanction,
as provided in section 179(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(2)), which is also discussed in the proposal at page 51274. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, section 179(a) provides for an air pollution grant sanction that applies to grants the EPA may award under
section 105. However, since it is not a sanction provided under section 179(b), it is not one of the sanctions that automatically
apply under section 179(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Application and Timing of Section 179(b) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although application of section 179(b) sanctions may become mandatory when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a)
(if the State does not correct the deficiency), it is not immediate. Instead, section 179(a) provides for a sanction
``clock,'' which is described in the proposal at page 51274. Generally, under section 179(a)'s sanction clock, the
sanction selected by EPA applies if the deficiency that prompted the finding is not corrected before the sanction
clock expires. (The sanction clock is further discussed in section II.B.3. of this document.)

C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposal, EPA proposed that the section 179(b)(2) offset sanction would apply in an area 18 months from the date
when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a). Furthermore, EPA proposed that the section 179(b)(1) highway sanction
would apply in an area 6 months following application of the offset sanction. The EPA proposed to sequence the application
of sanctions under section 179(a) in this manner in all cases unless EPA determines, through individual notice-and-comment
rulemaking, that the highway sanction will apply first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal addressed the sequence in which sanctions shall apply as required under section 179(a) with respect
to a finding made under subsections (1)&hyph;(4) specific to any implementation plan or plan revision required under
part D or any implementation plan or revision required under part D found substantially inadequate pursuant to section
110(k)(5). In general, part D plans and plan revisions are required for areas designated nonattainment under section
107.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal did not encompass findings EPA can make under section 179(a) regarding SIP calls for non-part D plans
or plan revisions or the sanction provisions in section 110(m) of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It also does not encompass any findings EPA may make under other titles of the Act (e.g., section 502(d) for operating
permitting programs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
While part D generally applies to nonattainment areas, some requirements extend to other areas. For example, section
184(a) specifically created at enactment an ozone transport region, called the Northeast Ozone Transport Region
(NOTR), which is comprised of several mid-Atlantic and New England States and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Area containing the District of Columbia (see ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990'' at page 13527 (57 FR 13498)). Though areas within some of these States may not be designated
nonattainment, the States must submit revisions to their SIP's by certain statutory deadlines to include specific
part D measures for these areas (e.g., enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program, reasonably available
control technology for volatile organic compounds (VOC) sources).

Section 110(m) of the Act grants EPA broad discretionary authority to apply either sanction listed in section 179(b)
``at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes'' a finding under section 179(a) with respect to any portion
of the State, subject to certain limitations (57 FR 44534, Sept. 28, 1993). The selection of sanctions being made by
this action, however, does not apply to the imposition of sanctions by EPA under section 110(m). Note that sanction
selection for section 110(m) findings will be made through notice-and-comment rulemaking independent from this
action.

2. Rationale for Sanction Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At pages 51274&hyph;51275 of the proposal, EPA described the purpose sanctions can serve. One function is to encourage
compliance with the Act's requirements. A second function of sanctions is to protect and preserve air quality in areas
until the deficiency prompting the sanctions-initiating finding can be corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal at page 51275, for three reasons, EPA proposed that, as a general matter, the offset sanction apply
at 18 months followed by the highway sanction 6 months thereafter. First, EPA stated that conceptually the offset
sanction will, in general, provide a more certain air quality benefit in the shorter and longer term than the highway
sanction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the proposal stated the offset sanction provides greater potential for more significant air quality protection
because it potentially affects all categories of stationary sources and, depending on the pollutant(s) addressed
in the deficiency prompting the finding, may affect all criteria pollutants (i.e., pollutants for which EPA has promulgated
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) such as carbon monoxide (CO), PM&hyph;10 (particles with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers), etc.). By contrast, the highway sanction would affect only
mobile sources and pollutants emitted by mobile sources. (Mobile sources are not, for instance, regarded as significant
emitters of lead and sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in addition to air quality considerations, the 2-to-1 offset sanction is less complicated to implement and
administer than the highway sanction by its very nature and because of the manner in which EPA intends to effectuate
it, as discussed in the proposal at pages 51275&hyph;51277. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA noted in the proposal that it does not regard sanctions as a long-term solution to air quality problems
but rather intends to work with States to resolve deficiencies as rapidly as possible. Thus, by applying the offset
sanction at 18 months, if the State corrects the deficiency prompting the finding prior to 6 months thereafter, then
the highway sanction would not apply and EPA and other affected agencies (most notably the Department of Transportation
(DOT)) would not be faced with its comparatively greater implementation and administration burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA, therefore, proposed, as a general matter, that the offset sanction apply before the highway funding sanction
following a section 179(a) finding. The EPA recognized, however, that in specific cases the particular circumstances
may lead EPA to conclude that it is more appropriate for the highway sanction to apply first. Therefore, EPA has specifically
noted that it may go through notice-and-comment rulemaking for the highway sanction to apply after 18 months and the
offset sanction 6 months thereafter. (The sanction sequence rationale is further discussed in section II.B.1. of
this document.)

3. Sanction Effectuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At pages 51275&hyph;51277 of the proposal, EPA describes how the offset sanction applies and notes that, under the
highway sanction, EPA imposes a prohibition on approval by the Secretary of DOT of certain highway projects and grants.
Thus, the highway sanction is not directly implemented by EPA. However, EPA noted that it is in the process of developing
procedures with DOT to provide for the coordinated implementation of the highway sanction. (Sanction effectuation
is further discussed in section II.B.2 of this document.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Opportunity for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, under section 179(a), the Act requires that sanctions apply if the deficiency that prompted EPA's
finding is not corrected within the timeframes prescribed. The only discretion afforded EPA is which of the two section
179(b) sanctions applies at 18 months and which 6 months thereafter. The proposal noted that if in the future EPA makes
exceptions to this rule, then in individual notice-and-comment rulemakings EPA will seek comment on whether the
highway sanction shall apply after 18 months and the offset sanction shall apply 6 months thereafter given the circumstances
at hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also noted that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides citizens with a means that could be used
to petition EPA to propose that the highway sanction apply first. The APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(e), provides that ``Each agency
(including EPA) shall give an interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.''
This provision could conceivably be invoked by a citizen to petition EPA to propose that the highway sanction apply
first with respect to a section 179(a) finding covered by this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Today's Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this document, EPA is promulgating a rule which provides that the section 179(b)(2) offset sanction shall apply
in an area 18 months from the date when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a) with regard to that area if the deficiency
prompting the finding is not corrected within such period. The final rule also provides that the section 179(b)(1)
highway sanction shall apply in an area 6 months following application of the offset sanction in cases where the deficiency
has still not been corrected within that period. The section 179(b) sanctions shall be sequenced in this manner in
all cases unless EPA proposes the highway sanction to apply first through separate notice-and-comment rulemaking.
This final rule applies to plan or plan revisions required under part D but does not apply to plans or plan revisions
required under part D found substantially inadequate pursuant to section 110(k)(5). The proposed rule applied to
both types of SIP's; a discussion of why the latter type of SIP's_commonly known as part D ``SIP calls''_are not covered
by the final rule is in section II.C.3. This rule also has the immediate effect of applying the offset sanction on September
6, 1994 in affected areas for which the Administrator has not determined that the 18-month sanction clock has expired
by that date and for which the deficiency prompting the finding has not been corrected by that date. Specifically,
in the notice section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is providing a list of areas that will be potentially subject to sanctions on September 6, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the proposed rule did include tables in which EPA intended to list areas subject to sanctions. In the final
rule, EPA has removed the tables from the rule and decided to provide information on areas that will be potentially
subject to sanctions in the separate notice mentioned above. (Sections II.C.5. and III.B. below include a discussion
of why the tables were removed from the proposed rule and why such removal does not carry any substantive significance.)

Summary of Comments.

The EPA's proposal for the sequence of mandatory sanctions and the rationale are provided in sections I.C.1. and I.C.2.
of this document, as well as in the proposal at pages 51274&hyph;5. The EPA received 14 comments on this part of the proposed
rule. Comments on the sanction sequence and rationale can generally be considered in four groups: (1) Commenters
who believe the sequence should be reversed with the highway sanction applying first, (2) commenters who believe
that EPA should determine sanction order on a case-by-case basis, (3) commenters who believe that the nature of the
deficiency should be considered in determining sanction sequence, and (4) commenters who support the sequence as
proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters stated that the sequence in which sanctions apply should be reversed with the highway sanction generally
applying first. Several of the commenters contend that the highway sanction will be more effective at compelling
State correction of SIP deficiencies because it would have greater economic impact, and it will be more effective
at addressing political and statewide failures. One commenter disagrees with EPA's rationale that the offset sanction
is more likely to produce a greater air quality benefit, arguing instead that the highway sanction better encourages
early State compliance. Several commenters challenge EPA's rationale that the offset sanction potentially applies
to all criteria pollutants; the commenters argue that the fact that stationary sources emit more types of pollutants
is irrelevant since, in the proposed rule, the offset sanction applies only to the pollutant(s) in the deficiency.
The commenters also raise an argument that EPA's proposed sequence unfairly burdens industry when the SIP deficiency
is State-caused and that sources will be unfairly penalized due to project location and timing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters believe that EPA should determine sanction order on a case-by-case basis. These commenters express
concern that EPA's streamlined approach provides insufficient notice of sanctions and leaves many sanction application
details unclear. One commenter argues that EPA should streamline its own rulemaking processes rather than deny notice
to affected parties. These commenters were also concerned that general application of the offset sanction would
negatively impact stationary sources. One commenter argues economic competitiveness and air quality will deteriorate
under the offset sanction. Two commenters were concerned that because of the length of the EPA rulemaking process
stationary sources will bear the brunt of the sanction burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters believe that the nature of the SIP deficiency should be considered in determining sanction sequence.
One commenter believes that the sanction chosen should be linked to the SIP deficiency and that EPA must conduct notice-and-comment
rulemaking to determine whether the highway sanction applies first as to specific types of SIP deficiencies. The
commenter is concerned that stationary sources will bear the brunt of the sanctions burden, and that this result could
stifle economic development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters support the proposed sequence of sanctions. One commenter supports the position that the link between
the highway sanction and air quality benefits is uncertain and another commenter agrees that the offset sanction
provides a quantifiable and more likely air quality benefit. Another commenter supported EPA's concerns regarding
the administrative and implementation burdens of the highway sanction as a basis for the offset sanction applying
first.

Response to Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this final rule, EPA has maintained the proposed sanction sequence with the offset sanction generally applying
first and the highway sanction second. The EPA continues to believe this sequence is supported by the proposed rationales
that the offset sanction (compared to the highway sanction) will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide a more certain and direct air quality benefit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Potentially affect more criteria pollutants, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be easier to implement and administer. The EPA disagrees with the comments that highway sanctions will always
more effectively address SIP-related deficiencies and should, therefore, be generally applied first. In addition,
EPA does believe that the offset sanction will more likely produce a net air quality benefit. In some cases, the offset
sanction may be more effective at resolving SIP deficiencies. For example, in an area that is undergoing significant
economic growth, the offset sanction could help bring pressure through stationary sources wishing to expand or locate
in the area and which are faced with the need for an additional emission offset increment. Furthermore, offsets achieved
by such a sanction would benefit air quality in the affected area. However, in particular instances, the EPA does not
deny that the offset sanction may not be as effective because, for example, the area may be economically depressed
and not experiencing growth. In such a case, there may be less air quality benefit and perhaps less pressure to correct
the deficiency in applying the offset sanction first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, overall EPA continues to believe that conceptually the offset sanction (compared to the highway sanction)
provides a more certain, direct air quality benefit in the near and long term and potentially covers more pollutants.
An increased new source review (NSR) offset ratio necessarily reduces air pollutant emissions as sources modify
or locate in an area under the offset sanction. By contrast, the highway sanction may not directly reduce overall motor
vehicle emissions in the near term and any air quality benefits resulting from the highway sanction would be indirect,
as application of the highway sanction would not necessarily prevent motorists from driving, nor even necessarily
result in overall emissions reductions, at least in the short term. The EPA recognizes that in some instances it may
be more appropriate for the highway sanction to apply to address a political failure and believes there are adequate
mechanisms provided under the rule to address these instances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA did not intend to suggest in the proposal that the offset sanction will apply, in every case, to all criteria
pollutants. The offset sanction will apply only to all criteria pollutants (and their precursors) for which the area
is subject to the section 173 (42 U.S.C. 7503) offset requirement when the SIP deficiency is general in nature. When
the finding is specific to one or more pollutants (and its/their precursor(s)), the sanction applies only to those
pollutants (and/or precursor(s)). The statement in the proposal intended that the offset can potentially affect
all criteria pollutants, either because of pollutant-specific findings or general findings. This means that, regardless
of whether the finding is pollutant-specific or general, the offset sanction will generally apply at least to the
pollutants of direct concern, and sometimes to others as well. On the other hand, the highway sanction will potentially
affect only those pollutants mobile sources emit significantly and not, for instance, lead or SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, EPA also realizes that since CO nonattainment area problems are due primarily to mobile sources, arguably
application of the offset sanction may not address the more significant sources contributing to CO nonattainment
problems. Nonetheless, the offset sanction still applies to CO for nonattainment NSR purposes and thus will affect
sources subject to nonattainment NSR that wish to locate or expand in a CO nonattainment area, which would provide
some air quality benefit in the area under the offset sanction. Therefore, EPA continues to believe that overall the
offset sanction is more likely to produce a greater air quality benefit than the highway sanction because, as sources
locate in an area, direct emission reductions will be achieved through the 2-to-1 offset for potentially any of the
criteria pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to imposing sanctions on a case-by-case basis, EPA believes there are two main disadvantages to this
approach which have led EPA to reject it. First, the individual notice-and-comment rulemakings that would be needed
for implementing the sanctions on a case-by-case basis would impose significant demands on EPA's resources. These
resources could otherwise be spent on activities that more directly serve the goal of the Act, namely, clean air. Second,
the approach taken in the final rule will provide certainty and sufficient notification to the parties affected about
the details of sanction application and consistency in the implementation of section 179. These details are further
discussed in section III.A. and in the detailed summary of comments document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to establishing a rule that links the first sanction to the deficiency on which the sanction is based, EPA believes
that approach fails to consider other important considerations with respect to sanctions such as which sanction
is more likely to yield the greater air quality benefit. The EPA believes, as a general matter, that the sanction that
results in the greater air quality benefit is a more important consideration than selecting the sanction sequence
based primarily on the nature of the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, EPA recognizes that in some cases it may be more appropriate to apply the highway sanction first if
the circumstances of the deficiency warrant and the offset sanction is unlikely to yield significant air quality
benefits. The EPA believes the rule provides the flexibility to do so. Additionally, EPA cannot predict, across all
sanction findings, which sanction will more effectively address State inaction and thus could not base the general
sanction sequence proposal on that factor. Fundamentally, EPA has based its sanction sequencing rationale primarily
on the basis of which sanction EPA believes is likely to yield the greater air quality benefit. It is impossible to gauge
the impact since the universe of areas which will be sanctioned and for what duration are not known.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not disagree that the offset sanction has the potential to impact industry and that this burden may be greater
on industry than on the transportation sector. However, by including the offset sanction in the Act, Congress clearly
intended that certain sources, by virtue of the timing and location of their projects, would be impacted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A discussion of EPA's approach for effectuating the offset and highway sanctions is provided in section I.C.3. of
this document and at pages 51275&hyph;7 of the proposal. The following is a brief summary of major comments and EPA's
responses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Offset Sanction. Comments on offset sanction effectuation addressed both the source and pollutant applicability
aspects of EPA's proposal. One commenter objects to the timing of the applicability of the offset sanction and believes
EPA's proposed approach is contrary to past EPA practice. The commenter argues that applying the increased offset
ratio to all sources that have not received a permit as of the date the sanction begins would stop many sources during
the permitting process for reasons beyond their control. The commenter believes that in the past EPA has avoided these
problems by applying tighter NSR requirements only where permit applications were not complete when the requirements
became effective. The commenter recommends EPA continue with this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments concern the pollutant applicability of the offset sanction. One commenter objects to the application
of the offset requirement to both ozone precursors (nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and volatile organic compounds (VOC)) even when the deficiency relates only to one of the pollutants. In support,
the commenter notes the broad nature of section 179 and the manner in which NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are treated under the Act vis-a-vis VOC emissions. Regarding PM&hyph;10 precursors, the commenter argues
that the offset sanction should apply to precursors only in those areas where EPA has approved a PM&hyph;10 SIP control
strategy imposing the offset requirement on PM&hyph;10 precursors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter believes that regardless of the SIP deficiency the offset sanction should apply to all criteria
pollutants and precursors. In support, the commenter argues that section 179 references section 173, which applies
to all offset requirements in title I of the Act, and that this reflects a clear Congressional intent to apply the offset
sanction to these pollutants. The commenter also believes that areas that have not yet received a section 182(f) (42
U.S.C. 7511a(f)) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption from the section 173 offset requirements should remain subject to the increased offset ratio for NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 until EPA grants an exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Highway Sanction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requests that the rule include a requirement that EPA notify several government entities of highway
sanctions to focus multi-agency resources on resolving SIP deficiencies. Another commenter believes that the flow
of flexible funds for certain programs (e.g., congestion mitigation air quality improvement program) should continue
to flow if sanctions apply because the funds are important for achieving the Act's goals by improving transit.

Response to Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Offset Sanction Applicability. Regarding offset sanction source and pollutant applicability, in the final
rule, EPA has maintained the approaches in the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On source applicability, EPA believes it is important to maximize the air quality benefit of the offset sanction by
requiring that sources whose permits are issued after the date the offset sanction applies comply with a 2-to-1 emission
offset requirement. Contrary to the comment, the source applicability definition is not a departure from all past
EPA practices because historically EPA has not always used the ``complete application'' definition. (The different
source applicability definitions EPA has used in the past are discussed in the detailed response to comments document.)
Therefore, EPA believes that past practice does not constrain it from determining today that it is important to enhance
the effectiveness of the offset sanction by defining source applicability on a permit issuance basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA believes that once the offset sanction applies, it would be a violation of the sanction for a permit to
be issued with an emission offset of less than 2-to-1. The plain language of section 179(a) and section 179(b)(2) does
not provide for nor contemplate any grace period based on whether a source has submitted a complete application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding pollutant applicability of the offset sanction, EPA believes the proposed applicability is reasonably
supported and will have the potential to effectively protect air quality. Section 179(b)(2) generally references
the offset requirements of section 173 and does not restrict EPA's ability to base the applicability of the sanction
on a pollutant or pollutants (and its/their precursor(s)). Moreover, pollutant-specific application of the offset
sanction is consistent with the requirements of section 179. Section 179(b)(2)'s language providing that ``the
ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be at least 2 to 1'' is general enough such that EPA can determine
the most reasonable method to apply the sanction. While section 179(b)(2) references the broader section 173 requirement,
EPA believes it is more reasonable, with one caveat,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to apply the offset sanction to the criteria pollutants specifically related to the SIP deficiency in question. Pollutant-specific
application of the offset sanction will encourage the State to correct its SIP deficiencies and will provide reductions
in emissions of the relevant pollutant in the interim, without unnecessarily punishing stationary sources in cases
where the State's program for other pollutants is adequate.

Where the SIP deficiency is general, the offset sanction applies to the criteria pollutant(s) (and its/their precursor(s))

for general SIP deficiencies is also discussed in section II.C.5. below.)

Regarding ozone and PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA is maintaining the approach in the proposal that the sanction applies
to ozone and PM&hyph;10 precursors. The caveat to that general rule has expanded in one minor respect with respect
to the ozone precursor NO

 nonattainment NSR requirements should not apply. In addition, EPA has added the exception that if the area otherwise
is not subject to the section 173 offset requirement for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (e.g., submarginal ozone nonattainment areas), then sources in that area would not be subject to that requirement
under the offset sanction (see sections 182(f) and 182(b)(2)). This exception is necessary in light of the specific
language of the offset provision, which ties the offset sanction specifically to offsets required under section
173. For PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA has retained the caveat for cases in which EPA has made a section 189(e) (42 U.S.C.
7513a(e)) determination for an area that PM&hyph;10 precursors are not significant.

Summary of Proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Under that interpretation, once the sanctions clock has started upon EPA making a finding under section 179(a), in
order to stop the clock, EPA must determine that the State has corrected the deficiency that prompted the finding.
Similarly, to remove section 179(b) sanctions applied under section 179(a), EPA must determine that the State has
come into compliance by correcting the deficiency that prompted the finding that resulted in the application of one
or both sanctions.

For general guidance on EPA's interpretation, at the time of proposal, of how the sanctions clock functions and what
is necessary to stop it, see the memorandum entitled ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals''
from John Calcagni to Air Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, July 9, 1992. A copy of this memorandum has been placed

For a finding that a State has failed to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP, or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails
to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k), the proposal provided that EPA will stop the sanctions clock
or remove any sanctions applied upon EPA's determination that the State has submitted the missing plan or plan element
and that the submittal meets the completeness criteria established pursuant to section 110(k)(1). Note that EPA's
July 9, 1992 SIP processing guidance indicated that if the 18-month sanction clock elapses during a completeness
review, sanctions would not be imposed unless and until EPA determined the plan to be incomplete.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In such a case, the 18-month clock would continue to run so that if EPA determined the plan to be incomplete after 18-months
had elapsed, sanctions would immediately apply.

would continue to apply upon State submittal until the submittal was determined to be complete.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal provided that if EPA disapproves a SIP submission based on its failure to meet one or more plan elements
required by the Act, to correct the deficiency for purposes of stopping the sanctions clock or removing the sanction,
the State must submit a revised SIP to EPA and EPA must approve that submittal pursuant to section 110(k). For a finding
that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented, the proposal provided that the sanctions clock would
stop or sanctions would be removed through notice-and-comment rulemaking determining that the State is implementing
the approved plan or part of a plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raise both practical and legal issues with respect to the proposal's sanction clock policy where it
indicates that EPA must fully approve SIP submittals before sanctions clocks that are started by disapprovals can
be stopped.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first commenter's practical concern is time. With respect to a sanctions clock started by a disapproval, because
of the length of the State's regulatory development, approval and adoption processes and EPA's review period, the
interpretation in the proposed rule could result in sanctions being imposed even if a State had fully adopted and submitted
the corrective rule. Sanctions would remain in effect until EPA finished its rulemaking approving the corrected
rule. The commenter is concerned that the rule could have an adverse impact solely because EPA had not had time to act
on SIP revisions that are fully approvable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further believes that EPA's policy is not supported by the language of the Act. The commenter argues
that the Act elsewhere explicitly distinguishes between correcting the deficiency and EPA's process of approving
a SIP. Section 110(c)(1)(B) states that the Administrator must promulgate a Federal implementation plan (FIP) within
two years of SIP disapproval ``*&blank;*&blank;* unless the state corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator
approves the plan or plan revision *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Section 179(a), though, merely provides that sanctions
shall apply ``unless such deficiency has been corrected *&blank;*&blank;*'' and does not include the phrase regarding
EPA plan approval. The commenter believes that EPA cannot ignore the difference between sections 110 and 179 because
to do so would constitute ``reading out'' or rendering meaningless the additional phrase of section 110(c)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support its legal argument, the commenter states that principles of statutory construction provide that effect
must be given to each word in a statutory provision, and that every effort must be made to avoid an interpretation which
renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, meaningless, or superfluous (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
942 F.2d 1427, 1432 (9th Cir. 1991)). The commenter also notes that an agency cannot ignore or ``read out'' part of a
statute (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
822 F.2d 104, 113 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to EPA's proposal, the commenter recommends that the sanctions clock policy for disapprovals follow
the process in the proposal for findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. The commenter states that under that
alternative policy the clock would be stopped if a new submittal is received, pending EPA's determination of whether
the deficiency has been corrected. The commenter urges EPA to adopt a consistent policy to stop sanction clocks in
all cases upon receiving a revised SIP submittal. If EPA's preliminary review indicates the deficiency has been corrected,
then the clock would remain stopped and EPA would proceed to approve the plan through rulemaking. If the deficiency
was not corrected initially, the clock would restart via a letter to the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second commenter raised similar concerns with EPA's proposal that actual approval was needed to stop a sanctions
clock started by a disapproval. According to the commenter, the clock should be suspended with the submittal to EPA
of a completed rulemaking and remain suspended unless EPA disapproves the SIP. The commenter notes that EPA has the
opportunity to participate in the State's rulemaking process to ensure the deficiency is corrected.

(1) Overview of Change One. For the reasons stated in subsection (4) of this section II.B.3.c., EPA does not adopt the
exact approach set forth by the commenters, which would actually stop a sanctions clock started by a disapproval upon
State submittal of a SIP. However, EPA has determined that it is reasonable to temporarily defer and/or stay the application
of sanctions, as appropriate,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 following SIP disapprovals, where EPA proposes to fully approve a SIP revision or proposes to conditionally approve
a SIP.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, EPA has determined that such deferral and/or staying of sanction application is reasonable following
findings of nonimplementation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 where EPA proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP. Simultaneous with such proposed approval or finding
of SIP implementation, EPA will issue a separate, interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency
that prompted the finding that started the sanctions clock. In all these cases, whether sanctions are deferred and/or
stayed depends on the timing of EPA's proposed action vis-a-vis the sanction clocks.

As discussed below under change two, the proposed sanction clock policy specifically provided for the deferral of
sanctions during completeness reviews of SIP's submitted following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings,
but not staying the sanctions. The concept set forth here for initial disapprovals and findings of failure to implement
is carried forth from this process developed in the proposal for initial findings of failure to submit or of incompleteness.
In carrying this concept over, EPA believes that it is logical and necessary that if the effect of sanction application
is to be deferred that sanctions actually applied should be stayed.

For initial SIP disapprovals where EPA subsequently fully approves the revised SIP, sanctions would be deferred
and/or stayed unless and until EPA's proposed full approval was reversed by a proposed disapproval or final disapproval
of the revised SIP in whole or in part. At that point, the interim final determination that the deficiency had been corrected
would be rescinded or reversed. For initial SIP disapprovals where EPA subsequently proposes to conditionally approve
the revised SIP, sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed unless and until EPA reverses its proposed conditional
approval by a proposed disapproval or final disapproval of the revised SIP in whole or in part. For initial SIP disapprovals
where EPA subsequently conditionally approves the revised SIP in final, sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed
unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval, or EPA proposes to disapprove in whole or in part
the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in its conditionally-approved SIP.

On July, 9, 1992, EPA issued a policy that included a discussion of how conditional approvals convert to disapprovals
(see memorandum entitled ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals'' from John Calcagni to Air
Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, July 9, 1992). But note that, by this action, EPA is withdrawing the part of
the July 1992 guidance that addresses how conditional approvals convert to disapprovals. In the near future, EPA
intends to issue additional guidance to address this aspect of the conditional approval policy.

For initial findings of nonimplementation, sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed unless and until EPA reversed
its proposed finding that the State was implementing its SIP by proposing to find or finally finding that the State
was not implementing its SIP or by withdrawing its proposed finding that the State was implementing its SIP. At the
point of that subsequent action, the interim final determination that the State had corrected the deficiency would
be rescinded or reversed. (Exactly how the application of sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed following SIP
disapprovals and nonimplementation findings is discussed in greater detail below in this section. Change one is
reflected in the rule in &sect;52.31 (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4).)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for the deferring and staying of sanctions in these cases is that the proposed full or conditional approval
or proposed finding that the State is implementing its SIP would be the basis for EPA's interim final determination
that the State has corrected the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When EPA issues this proposal, the Agency indicates that it believes it is more likely than not that the State is complying
with the relevant requirements of the Act. The EPA believes it would be inequitable for sanctions to apply in situations
where EPA has made such an affirmative finding, even though it is only preliminary. Moreover, EPA believes it would
be unfair to apply sanctions merely because the clock had expired before EPA is able to take final action on the submittal
in these situations given the length of the rulemaking process.

(2) Overview of Change Two. The second change to the rule concerns the guidance discussed in the preamble to the proposed
rule at page 51273, footnote 9, where EPA indicated that if the sanction clock started by a finding of failure to submit
or incompleteness expires during a completeness review for a subsequent SIP submittal, the sanction would not apply
unless and until EPA found the submittal incomplete. In this instance, EPA intended that the sanction clock would
not temporarily stop, but instead would continue to run. During that time, EPA would simply defer the application
of the sanction while it reviewed the SIP submittal to determine whether or not the State had corrected the deficiency
prompting the finding. Thus, if and when EPA found the SIP incomplete after expiration of the 18-month clock, the sanction
would apply on the date EPA found the plan incomplete.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After further analysis of this aspect of the sanction clock policy in the context of addressing comments, EPA has determined
that it is inappropriate to defer and/or stay sanctions when sanction clocks elapse during review for completeness
of plans submitted by States following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. Therefore, EPA's rule provides
that the temporary deferral and staying of the application of sanctions occurs only when EPA takes an affirmative
action in which it indicates the Agency's belief that the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding
(e.g., that the State has corrected the finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness). The EPA believes this change
is necessary since, upon further reflection, EPA realizes that in such a situation there has been no prior affirmative
action by EPA preliminarily or finally determining that the State has, in fact, corrected the deficiency. A proposed
approval of a revised SIP following a disapproval constitutes such an action as does a proposed finding that a State
is implementing its SIP following a finding of nonimplementation. However, mere EPA receipt of a SIP submittal from
a State following a nonsubmittal or incompleteness finding does not constitute such an action, since EPA takes no
affirmative action preliminarily indicating that the State has submitted a complete SIP, and there is nothing to
give rise to an interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this change, sanctions will apply if a sanction clock expires during a completeness review of a SIP submitted
following a nonsubmittal or incompleteness finding. An example illustrates the implications of this change. Suppose
EPA finds that a State failed to submit a SIP and then at month 17 the State submits a SIP which the Agency then starts reviewing
for completeness. Month 18 arrives and EPA is still reviewing the submittal. Under the approach in the proposal, application
of the offset sanction at month 18 would be deferred unless and until EPA found the plan incomplete. Under the final
rule, the sanction will apply at month 18 and only be lifted once EPA takes affirmative action finding the plan complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For EPA to continue with the proposed policy of deferring sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings,
EPA would have to view mere receipt of a submittal from the State as a preliminary correction of the deficiency. However,
EPA's view is that receipt of a State plan does not constitute an affirmative EPA determination that the revised SIP
is complete.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, it is inappropriate to defer and/or stay sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings.
Furthermore, once EPA has affirmatively determined the plan is complete, any sanctions clock or any applied sanctions
would be permanently stopped. Therefore, it is inappropriate to defer or stay sanctions following nonsubmittal
and incompleteness findings until EPA has affirmatively determined the plan is complete.

 The EPA believes this change, as well as change one, makes the Agency's approach in deferring and staying the application
of sanctions more consistent with the requirements of the Act.

Arguably, EPA could make an interim final determination that the State's submittal is complete. However, such an
interim determination is impractical and inappropriate for at least two reasons. One, the short time period provided
under the Act for EPA to make completeness determinations (i.e., 60 days) indicate that Congress did not intend for
EPA (nor contemplate for EPA) to make preliminary completeness determinations. Two, the nature of the completeness
review does not lend itself to EPA making preliminary and final determinations. The completeness review is intended
as a straightforward exercise to determine if the SIP revision includes the basic elements to warrant further review
for overall adequacy. Therefore, there is no room for a preliminary determination; any review sufficient to make
such a preliminary determination would be sufficient for EPA's final completeness determination.

A clarification is being made in the final rule which was not specifically addressed in the proposed rule. Following
nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings, the final rule effectively provides that sanction clocks can be stopped
(and sanctions lifted) only when EPA makes an affirmative completeness finding, and not when SIP's become complete
by operation of law pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(B) of the Act. This change is further discussed in section II.C.4.
below.

(3) Scenarios Illustrating First Change. The following five scenarios illustrate how sanctions can be deferred
and/or stayed following SIP disapprovals and nonimplementation findings.

Note that in the five cases discussed below in the ``scenarios illustrating first change,'' sanctions would apply
or reapply when a conditional approval converts to a disapproval just as they do when a proposed full approval is reversed
to a disapproval. Note also that, unlike full approvals, the mandatory sanctions process would not cease upon final
conditional approval. Following a disapproval, as indicated above, if EPA proposes full approval of the State's
revised plan, resulting in the deferral and/or staying of sanction application, and then takes final, full approval
action, the mandatory sanctions process ceases. However, if the scenario were one where EPA was conditionally approving
the plan, the final conditional approval does not stop the mandatory sanction process because it does not represent
EPA's final determination that the SIP is adequate. The EPA will make that determination when it reviews the revised
plan the State commits to submitting as part of the conditional approval. Ultimately, of course, if the State fulfills
its commitment and EPA approves the State's plan revision, then any sanction clocks are permanently stopped and no
sanctions are applied or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reapplied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, if, before month 18, EPA proposes to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is
implementing its SIP and that action is reversed 24 or more months after the finding, at which time the 18-month clock
has expired, application of the offset sanction is deferred until EPA's proposed approval or proposed finding that
the State is implementing its SIP is reversed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For both types of findings, the offset sanction applies on the date EPA reverses its preliminary finding. Following
disapprovals, where EPA proposed to fully approve the SIP, the reversal would be either a proposed or final disapproval
in whole or in part, whichever occurs. Following disapprovals, where EPA proposes to or finally conditionally approves
the SIP, the reversal would occur as described in subsection (1) above of this section II.B.3.c. Following findings
of nonimplementation, the reversal would be either a proposed or final finding, whichever occurs, that the State
was not implementing its SIP. For both disapprovals and nonimplementation findings, the highway sanction applies
6 months from the date the offset sanction applies, unless EPA determines within that period that the State corrected
the deficiency prompting the finding. (This scenario is provided for in the rule in &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(i), (d)(3)(i),
and (d)(4)(i).)

This scenario assumes that EPA proposes approval prior to 18 months and that EPA's positive finding is reversed after
24 months. In that instance, after 24 months, only the 18-month clock has expired (and not the 6-month clock) because
the 6-month clock is not triggered until the offset sanction applies. (Section III.A. below discusses how the section
179 sanction clocks function.) Therefore, in this scenario, the 6-month clock does not start until EPA reverses its
positive finding after 24 months. The next paragraph and Figure 1 give an example of how this functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion and Figure 1 provide an example of how this process functions with respect to a sanctions
clock started by an initial disapproval. The process would function in the same manner where the initial finding was
a finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA issues a SIP disapproval, initiating the section 179 sanction process.
Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP to EPA which EPA proposes to fully or conditionally approve, prior to 18
months from the date the sanctions clock started. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, making
a finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, the application of the offset sanction would be
deferred. Now suppose that, at month 25, EPA reverses its preliminary determination. The reversal would be a proposal
to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 25 (or, for final
actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction applies. The highway sanction then applies 6 months
later at month 31 (or, for final actions, shortly thereafter, as appropriate), if within that period EPA has not determined
that the State has corrected the deficiency.

Second, if EPA proposes (before expiration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18-month sanctions clock) to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing
its SIP and that proposal action is reversed before the 6-month clock expires that would have followed upon application
of the offset sanction, application of the offset sanction is deferred until such reversal of EPA's proposed finding.
The offset sanction applies on the date EPA's proposal finding is reversed (or, for final actions, on the action's
effective date). The highway sanction then applies 6 months later if EPA has not determined during that period that
the State has corrected the deficiency. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;&sect;52.31 (d)(2)(i),
(d)(3)(i) and (d)(4)(i).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The process would be the same for an initial disapproval. Suppose EPA makes a finding of nonimplementation, initiating
the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that EPA, prior to the end of the 18 month sanctions clock, proposes to find
that the State is implementing its approved SIP. At the time of the positive finding, EPA would simultaneously issue
an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this case, the application of the offset sanction would be deferred unless and until EPA reverses its proposed positive
finding. Now suppose that EPA, at month 22, reverses its proposed positive finding by withdrawing its proposed finding
that the State is implementing its SIP. At month 22 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset
sanction applies. The highway sanction then applies 6 months later at month 28 (or, for final actions, shortly thereafter,
as appropriate), if EPA has not determined that the State has corrected the deficiency.

Third, if EPA proposes (after month 18 but before expiration of the subsequent 6-month sanctions clock) to fully or
conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP, application of the offset sanction
is stayed unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. (This scenario assumes that EPA's reversal
occurs before expiration of the 6-month sanction clock.) For both types of findings, the offset sanction reapplies
on the date EPA's preliminary positive determination is reversed. The highway sanction applies 6 months from the
date the offset sanction initially applied, if EPA has not determined that the State has corrected the deficiency
prompting the finding. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(4)(ii).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion and Figure 3 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process
is the same where EPA has made an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA makes a SIP disapproval, initiating
the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP which EPA, after 18 months but before
the subsequent 6-month clock expires, proposes to fully or conditionally approve. The EPA would simultaneously
issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, application of the
offset sanction would be stayed unless and until EPA's proposed approval is reversed. Now suppose that, at month 22,
EPA reverses its proposed approval. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final
disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 22 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset
sanction reapplies. The highway sanction then applies at month 24, 6 months after the offset sanction originally
applied, unless EPA determines that the State corrected the deficiency within that period.

Fourth, if EPA proposes (after month 18, but before the subsequent 6-month sanctions clock expires) to fully or conditionally
approve a plan or proposes to find that the State is implementing its SIP, and EPA does not take action reversing such
positive action until after the subsequent 6-month clock expires, application of the offset sanction is stayed and
application of the highway sanction is deferred unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. The
offset sanction reapplies and the highway sanction applies on the date EPA's preliminary determination is reversed.
(This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;&sect;52.31(d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(4)(ii).)

The following discussion and Figure 4 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process

of the highway sanction deferred at the time EPA makes its positive finding. Now suppose that, at month 26, EPA reverses
its positive finding. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval
of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 26 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction
reapplies and the highway sanction applies.

Lastly, the rule also provides that, following a SIP disapproval or a finding of failure to implement, if EPA proposes
after both sanctions clocks have expired to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is
implementing its SIP, application of the offset and highway sanctions is stayed unless and until EPA's proposed positive
finding is reversed. The offset and highway sanctions reapply on the date EPA's preliminary determination is reversed.
(This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(4)(iii).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The following discussion and Figure 5 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process
functions the same for an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA disapproves a SIP, initiating the section
179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP which EPA, at 25 months, proposes to fully or conditionally
approve. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency.
In that case, the application of both sanctions would be stayed on the date of the positive action. Now suppose that,
at month 30, EPA reverses its proposed positive finding. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole
or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 30 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective
date), both sanctions reapply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Legal Basis and Rationale for Change One. The EPA believes that its policy clarification is consistent with the
statutory language of section 179 and that it is a reasonable interpretation of that language. The EPA believes this
policy is consistent with the legal requirements of section 179 of the Act and section 553 of the APA. Section 179(a)
of the Act requires sanctions to apply 18 months after a deficiency finding ``unless such deficiency has been corrected
*&blank;*&blank;*,'' and requires that sanctions apply ``until the Administrator determines that the State has
come into compliance *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The EPA interprets this language to require that EPA make a determination
that the State has corrected the deficiency before permanently stopping the sanctions clock or lifting sanctions.
In the case of a clock started by a disapproval, such a determination would be represented by a final, full approval.
However, EPA does not believe that section 179(a) requires a final approval in order to defer or stay the application
of sanctions, since the statutory language speaks generally in terms of ``correcting'' deficiencies and ``determining''
compliance without explicitly linking those events to final approval actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding SIP disapprovals, EPA recognizes the first commenter's concern over timing and believes that this policy
clarification eliminates the potential for sanctions applying in an area when EPA has a submittal in house for which
EPA has determined that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the deficiency that prompted the original
disapproval. Extending the approach for disapprovals to findings of nonimplementation also serves to avoid applying
sanctions when EPA has proposed that a State is implementing its approved SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, EPA believes it is consistent with section 179 to treat proposed full approvals following disapprovals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the basis for deferring or staying the application of sanctions, while not permanently stopping the sanctions
clock or permanently lifting sanctions. The EPA also believes it is consistent with section 179 for proposed and final
conditional approvals to be the basis for deferring and/or staying the application of sanctions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed full or conditional approval then forms the basis for EPA to issue an interim final determination, which
EPA would publish in a separate action in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contemporaneously with the proposed approval notice, that the State had corrected the deficiency and come into compliance
with the requirements of the Act.

 While this interim final determination would have the effect of deferring or staying sanctions, it would not have
the final effect of either approving the submitted SIP revision, or permanently stopping a sanctions clock or permanently
lifting sanctions. The interim final determination would be subject to notice and comment and would have effect only
until either EPA made a final determination that the deficiency was corrected at the time of a final approval of the
SIP revision, or EPA reversed its interim final determination at the time EPA reverses its proposed full or conditional
approval. If an EPA proposed full approval were reversed by a proposed disapproval, the Agency would publish a separate
action in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 withdrawing the interim final determination (that the State has corrected the deficiency) contemporaneously with
the notice of the proposed disapproval. If an EPA proposed approval were reversed by a final disapproval, EPA would
take final action finding that the deficiency has not been corrected in the final disapproval action. For an EPA proposed
conditional approval, a reversal could occur by a proposed or final disapproval. For an EPA final conditional approval,
a reversal would occur when the conditional approval converts to a disapproval through the State's failing to submit
a complete revised SIP to which it committed or by EPA's disapproval of the State's revised SIP.

In NRDC v. EPA, No. 92&hyph;1535, slip. op. at 18 (D.C. Cir. May 6, 1994), the Court struck down EPA's policy of conditionally
approving committal SIP's (i.e., SIP's consisting solely of a commitment). However, the Court provided that ``the
conditional approval mechanism was intended to provide EPA with an alternative to disapproving substantive, but
not entirely satisfactory, SIP's *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The EPA will issue conditional approvals consistent with
that Court's opinion.

Since a final conditional approval has the effect of continuing the staying and/or deferring of sanctions, upon final
conditional approval, EPA would not publish a second interim final determination that the State has corrected the
deficiency (see footnote 18).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that this approach is similar to the method courts traditionally use to grant interim equitable relief.
Courts may grant preliminary injunctions to parties that the court determines are likely to succeed on the merits
of their case, where there is no adequate legal remedy available, and where the public interest would not be served
in not granting the injunction. Such injunctions may typically last until the court has finally decided the merits
of the case, either for or against the party granted the injunction. Deferring or staying the application of sanctions
upon proposed approval of a SIP revision is analogous, in that an EPA proposed approval represents EPA's view that
it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the disapproval deficiency and come into compliance with the
requirements of the Act. Also, as SIP approval actions generally require notice-and-comment rulemaking before
they can become final, if a sanctions clock is due to expire after proposed approval but before the Agency can practicably
fulfill its notice and comment duties and grant final approval, there is no other ``remedy'' available to relieve
the State from the punishment of sanctions, even though it is probable that the State has corrected the deficiency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA does not believe, following proposed approvals, that it would be in the public interest for sanctions
to remain in effect, as at that point the Agency believes that there is nothing further that the State need do to come
into compliance, and thus there is no further need for the deterrent effect of sanctions. The EPA also believes that
in these situations it would be especially unfair to States to begin the application of sanctions where the only reason
the sanctions clock has not permanently stopped is that the Agency cannot complete its rulemaking process to finally
approve the SIP before sanctions apply. Finally, EPA notes that like the judicial preliminary injunction model,
this approach provides that upon reversal of EPA's preliminary assessment that the SIP revision is approvable, and
that, therefore, the deficiency has not been corrected, sanctions would be in effect as if the interim final determination
that the State had corrected the deficiency had never been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also believes that this approach is consistent with the requirements of section 553 of the APA. Generally,
under the APA, agency rulemaking affecting the rights of individuals must comply with certain minimum procedural
requirements, including publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and providing an opportunity for the public to submit written comments on the proposal, before the rulemaking can
have final effect. The EPA will not be providing an opportunity for public comment before those deferrals or stays
are effective. Consequently, EPA's approach may appear to conflict with the requirements of the APA. However, EPA
will provide an opportunity to comment on the proposed approval that was the basis for the interim final decision and
will provide an opportunity, after the fact, for the public to comment on the interim final decision. Thus, an opportunity
for comment will be provided before any sanctions clock is permanently stopped or any already applied sanctions are
permanently lifted. In the context of the SIP approval rulemaking, and with respect to the interim final rule, the
public would have an opportunity to comment on the appropriateness of EPA's interim determination that the State
had corrected the deficiency and on whether the State should remain subject to sanctions, even though the deferral
or stay is already effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for allowing such an interim final action stems from section 553(b)(B) of the APA which provides that the
notice and opportunity for comment requirements do not apply when the Agency finds that those procedures are ``impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' In the case of sanctions, EPA believes it would be both impracticable
and contrary to the public interest to have to propose and provide an opportunity to comment before any relief is provided
from the effect of sanctions. First, until EPA proposes approval of a SIP revision, the Agency's first step in determining
whether a State's SIP submittal meets the requirements of the Act, EPA is not in a position to propose that the State
has corrected the deficiency; thus, there is no point in the process before proposed approval at which EPA could propose
that the State has corrected the deficiency and provide an opportunity for meaningful public comment on the issue.
Second, as discussed above, EPA believes it would be unfair to the State and its citizens, and thus not in the public
interest, for sanctions to remain in effect following an EPA proposed approval, since at that point the Agency has
completed a thorough evaluation of the State's SIP revision and publicly stated its belief that the submittal is approvable
and that the State has corrected the deficiency, but due to the procedural requirements of the Act the Agency has not
yet been able to issue a final approval. The EPA believes sanctions coming into effect following proposed approvals
would unnecessarily risk potential dislocation in government programs and the marketplace. The EPA also believes
that the risk of an inappropriate deferral or stay would be comparatively small, given the limited scope and duration
deferrals and stays would have and given the rule's mechanism for making sanctions effective upon reversal of its
initial determination that the State had corrected the deficiency. Consequently, EPA believes that the ``good cause''
exception under the APA allows the Agency to dispense with notice and comment procedures before deferrals and stays
of sanctions become effective, and that it is thus appropriate to respond to the commenters with the approach adopted
in today's rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Responses to Other Comments. The EPA does not support the alternative proposed by the commenters that EPA temporarily
or permanently stop the sanction clocks started by disapprovals upon EPA receipt of a submittal that the State believes
corrects the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA cannot determine whether the State has corrected the deficiency until it reviews the plan for adequacy. If
the sanction clock were temporarily or permanently stopped upon mere submission of a plan following any section 179(a)
disapproval (or finding of nonimplementation) and not started again until subsequent disapproval, mandatory sanctions
would then take that much longer to have the effect of encouraging State compliance and protecting air quality in the
area. Temporarily or permanently stopping the clock upon mere submission of a plan could result in abuse of the system
by States knowingly submitting SIP's that EPA cannot approve in order to defer the application of sanctions. By allowing
such abuses, such an approach would also be unfair to States which, despite a good faith effort at developing a corrective
rule, are unable to avert sanctions following disapproval. In sum, under the revised policy, the underlying requirement
for stopping the sanction clock is maintained: EPA must take final action to fully approve a submitted SIP revision
or find that a State is implementing its SIP in order to permanently stop the sanctions clock and permanently lift any
sanctions. As discussed above, EPA will defer and/or stay the application of sanctions when it proposes a positive
finding that forms the basis for EPA to determine through an interim final action that the deficiency has been corrected;
but in these cases EPA will not temporarily or permanently stop the underlying clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also believes that its interpretation is legally supported under the Act. Generally, section 179 states that,
``*&blank;*&blank;* unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding, disapproval,
or determination *&blank;*&blank;*'' one of the sanctions shall apply, as selected by the Administrator. Section
110(c)(1) of the Act requires EPA to promulgate a FIP at any time within 2 years after the Administrator finds that a
State has not made a required submission or has made an incomplete submission, or disapproves a plan submission, ``unless
the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision, before the Administrator
promulgates such Federal implementation plan.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The running of the sanctions clock is tied to the particular deficiency at issue. For example, if the clock was triggered
by a finding of failure to submit or a finding of incompleteness, the clock will stop if EPA determines that the State
submits a complete plan; it is not also necessary for the plan to be actually approved to stop the clock. If the complete
submission is later disapproved, then a new 18-month clock will begin to run, as provided in section 179(a), and will
continue to run until that deficiency is corrected with an EPA approved plan. For the FIP clock, in addition to the deficiency
being corrected, section 110(c)(1) includes an additional criterion_EPA SIP approval_that must be satisfied for
EPA not to have to promulgate a FIP within 2 years of a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness. The explicit reference
to an approval as an added prerequisite_beyond ``correcting the deficiency''_ makes clear that, in the context of
failures to submit or submission of incomplete plans, plan approval is quite distinct from ``correcting the deficiency.''
Therefore, the Administrator's approval is distinct from ``correcting the deficiency'' for failure to submit and
incompleteness. Therefore, the fact that the ``SIP approval'' language is redundant for disapprovals, where SIP
approval is part of correcting the deficiency, does not render that clause superfluous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation of the section 179 sanction clock does not ``read out'' the section 110(c) requirement, but rather
merely illustrates that following disapprovals what is necessary to stop the sanction and FIP clocks is the same:
EPA approval of the SIP. (See EPA's July 9, 1992 SIP processing guidance, page 10.) However, as discussed above, this
is not the case for sanction clocks started by a finding of failure to submit or a finding of incompleteness. There,
the State can correct the deficiency merely by submitting a SIP EPA finds complete. This would stop the sanctions clock.
In these situations, the additional step of EPA approval is required to stop the FIP clock, under the plain language
of section 110(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA's interpretation of section 179(a) does not render the provisions of section 110(c)(1)(B) inconsistent,
meaningless or superfluous. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case cited by the commenter addressed a situation in which one word, ``promulgation,'' was argued by petitioners
to have the same meaning as another, ``approval'' (942 F.2d at 1342). The court rejected that argument because failing
to distinguish between the terms would have resulted either in a conflict between two subsections of the Clean Water
Act or made superfluous the use of ``approval'' in another subsection (Id). Here, EPA's interpretation of what is
required to correct a deficiency under section 179(a) does not conflict with the requirement for EPA approval to stop
a FIP clock. It logically follows that approval is implicitly required to correct a deficiency based on a disapproval,
since a State cannot be considered to have remedied the underlying flaw that led to a disapproval until EPA has determined
that the State's attempt to do so is approvable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The explicit language in section 110(c)(1)(B) is necessary because FIP clocks also may be started by a finding of failure
to submit or SIP disapproval. Congress was explicitly providing that in both these instances EPA approval is required
to stop a FIP clock. Therefore, the reference in section 110(c) to the need for EPA approval still has meaning when the
initial failure was a failure to submit or an incompleteness finding. Thus, EPA's interpretation does not render
superfluous the explicit language in section 110(c)(1)(B).

As discussed above, EPA believes it is appropriate at the point of proposed approval to contemporaneously issue an
interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency for purposes of deferring or staying the
application of any sanctions that are due. Again, this interim final determination would be subject to the condition
that EPA grant final approval to the SIP, and would not have any final effect on the actual approval action. If the subsequent
condition is not met (i.e., if EPA's proposed approval is reversed by a proposed or final disapproval), from that point
on the interim final determination would have no effect and any sanctions required to be applied would be applied.

, 822 F.2d at 113). That case addressed a petitioner's attempt to ignore a specific condition of the Clean Water Act's
applicability provision, which the court viewed as an unacceptable method of construing statutes (Id). Here, rather
than disregarding the requirement that EPA approval is necessary to stop a FIP clock, EPA is interpreting section
179(a) to implicitly require that same element to be satisfied before a sanctions clock started for a disapproval
can be stopped. This in no way ignores the section 110(c)(1)(B) language for purposes of the FIP clock, nor represents
an attempt to interpret the Act such that the language of section 110(c)(1)(B) does not have full effect. As stated
above, the reference to EPA approval in that section still has meaning where the clock was started by a finding of failure
to submit or incompleteness.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another commenter believes that the final rule should provide for resetting the sanctions clock whenever a State
that had failed to submit a timely SIP submits one, even if the SIP is later found to be incomplete. The commenter notes
that section 179 provides for an 18-month period following one of four different types of findings of inadequate State
action before sanctions can be imposed. The commenter argues that EPA illegally shortens this period by combining
into one, two types of inadequate action under the same 18-month period, and that the final rule should provide for
separate clocks for each type of inadequate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter is concerned that States may be tempted to view the 18-month sanctions clock as additional time
in which to meet a deadline. The commenter believes that Congress did not intend that States that failed to submit a
timely SIP and later submitted an inadequate SIP would have more time before facing sanctions than States that submitted
a complete but unapprovable SIP on time. While the commenter agrees with EPA's policy that incomplete submittals
cannot temporarily stop the sanctions clock, the commenter believes the overall policy rewards delay in completing
programs. The commenter believes that the final rule should state that only EPA approval of a final rule stops the clock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Responses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, section 179 indicates that sanctions apply within certain timeframes, unless EPA determines that
the deficiency that prompted the finding starting the sanctions clock has been corrected within those timeframes.
Therefore, EPA believes the Act requires that sanction clocks stop for findings of failure to submit and findings
of incompleteness when EPA finds a subsequently submitted SIP complete (i.e., finds that the deficiency has been
corrected). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA disagrees that a clock started by a finding of failure to submit should stop based on a mere submittal that may
or may not be complete. The Act provides under section 110(k)(1)(C) that where the Administrator determines that
a plan is incomplete the State is treated as not having made the submission. Based on this, EPA believes that an affirmative
finding that a SIP is complete is necessary to cure a nonsubmittal or incompleteness deficiency and stop sanction
clocks initiated by such findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interpretation is further supported by the fact that a finding of failure to submit and incompleteness are provided
for under the same provision of sections 179(a)(1) and 179(a)(3)(A).

On the other hand, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to allow only EPA approval to permanently stop the sanction
clock for all types of findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is conceivable that a State could abuse the system under the process established in the final rule by submitting
a complete but inadequate SIP at 17 months that stops a sanctions clock that started based on a finding of failure to
submit or a finding of incompleteness. Such an area could face sanctions later than the State that submitted a timely,
complete but unapprovable SIP. However, as discussed above, EPA believes the reference to ``such deficiency'' immediately
following the list of the types of deficiency findings in section 179(a) indicates that sanctions clocks will stop
if and when the State corrects the specific deficiency that prompted the finding. Consequently, the running and stopping
of the clock is tied to the particular deficiency at issue, and EPA believes that it lacks the statutory authority to
apply mandatory sanctions under section 179 upon those States that initially failed to make a submission (through
failure to submit or by virtue of an incomplete submission) but which have subsequently submitted a complete plan.
The submission of a complete plan is sufficient to stop a clock started for a failure to submit any or a complete plan
because at that point the State has corrected the specific earlier deficiency of not having submitted a complete plan.
Following this correction, the plain language of section 179 does not allow application of mandatory sanctions due
to the original deficiency, but if the complete submission is later disapproved, a new sanction clock will begin to
run and will continue to run until that specific deficiency is corrected.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA believes that overall its policy is consistent with the language of section 179 and rational in that it recognizes
that what the State must do to correct a deficiency relates directly to the nature of the finding, and that overall this
policy will encourage compliance with Act requirements.

Furthermore, it appears that the approach articulated by this commenter (i.e., that sanctions clocks and FIP clocks
are both stopped by EPA approval of a revised SIP) would present the problems recognized in reading out of section 110(c)(1)
the clause ``the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision'' (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Act contains due dates by which the State is required to submit certain SIP's. The EPA does not believe
that Congress established the 18-month period before mandatory sanctions must apply as a grace period in which States
have a legal right under section 179 to submit SIP's after the relevant statutory due date. In fact, EPA interprets
section 110(m) of the Act as providing EPA with the authority to ``*&blank;*&blank;* apply any of the sanctions listed
in section 179(b) at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding, disapproval, or determination
under *&blank;*&blank;* section 179(a) *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, EPA is not precluded from taking more
aggressive action than required under section 179 when States fail to correct deficient plans.

Lack of Good Faith Determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(a), both the offset and highway sanctions shall apply after 18 months if the Administrator finds
a lack of good faith on the part of the State. In the proposal at page 51274, EPA indicated that any finding of a lack of
good faith EPA makes under section 179(a) will be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believes that the final rule should define a ``lack of good faith'' and require application of both sanctions
as a default where it exists. The commenter believes that some situations may require fact specific judgment, while
others are so extreme that they presumptively prove the State has decided not to make a good faith effort at complying.
The commenter believes that EPA need not undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking with respect to findings of a lack
of good faith. Another commenter believes that the phrase ``if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part
of the State'' is subjective and ambiguous and needs defining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, EPA still believes findings of a lack of good faith under section 179(a) must be subject
to notice-and-comment since it is a discretionary action which requires exercise of a substantial degree of judgment
on EPA's part. The public should have an opportunity to comment on the basis for these actions. Further, EPA does not
yet have a policy on how to further define the Act's language, or when and where it plans to make findings of a lack of good
faith other than the case-by-case approach described above. The notice-and-comment rulemaking will provide an
opportunity for the public to comment on EPA's interpretation of a lack of good faith in each case-specific circumstance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sanction Timing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal at page 51272 indicated that since section 179(a) provides for automatic sanction application once
EPA has made the selection, under this sanction sequence rule sanctions will apply automatically in the order prescribed
herein in all instances in which sanctions are applied following findings under section 179(a) (1)&hyph;(4) that
EPA has already made or that EPA will make in the future, except when EPA takes a separate action to select a different
sequence of sanction application. However, the proposal indicated that where the sanction clock expires for any
findings before this action is final and effective and EPA has not taken independent sanction selection action, EPA
interprets section 179(a) to provide that sanctions shall not apply until EPA makes the sanction selection through
notice-and-comment rulemaking, such as this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At page 51272 of the proposal EPA also indicated that EPA intends to notify States of the automatic sanctions by letter
and publish a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which EPA amends the language of the rule to indicate areas subject to the applicable sanctions. The proposal provided
that if removal of sanctions is warranted, EPA would notify the State that sanctions are being removed and amend the
rule to reflect that.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believes that EPA's interpretation of section 179 is incorrect and that section 179 unambiguously
requires sanction application within 18 months of a finding. The commenter believes that Congress did not condition
EPA's mandatory sanction application duty on completion of notice-and-comment rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plain reading of section 179(a) is that sanctions, ``as selected by the Administrator,'' apply within certain
prescribed timeframes. The section does not provide any guidance to EPA on sanction application sequence. Given
this wide discretion, EPA believes that it is necessary for sanction selection to be subject to notice-and-comment
in order to provide for public comment. The EPA interprets the phrase ``as selected by the Administrator'' as words
of condition that must be met before mandatory sanctions apply. Indeed, EPA is undertaking this rulemaking to satisfy
the conditional duty so that sanctions may apply automatically when sanctions clocks expire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also conducting this rulemaking to eliminate the future need (except to reverse the sanction sequence)
for individual rulemakings for every finding with respect to part D requirements. The EPA believes in the long run
this action will facilitate smooth application of sanctions to encourage State compliance and protect air quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice and Comment for Nonsubmittal and Incompleteness Findings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposal at page 51272, EPA's view was that notice-and-comment is not required for findings of failure to submit
because of insufficient time provided by the statute. Since EPA has less than 60 days to determine whether a State's
submittal is complete, and it is impossible to provide notice-and-comment in 60 days, EPA believes that Congress
clearly intended that EPA should not go through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to making findings of failure
to submit. Additionally, EPA argued that even if EPA's findings of failure to submit were subject to APA rulemaking
procedures, EPA believed that the good cause exception to the rulemaking requirement applies (APA section 553(b)(B)).
Section 553(b)(B)of the APA provides that EPA need not provide notice and an opportunity for comment if EPA determines
that notice and comment are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The EPA argued that
notice and comment for findings of failure to submit does not require any judgment on the part of EPA and, therefore,
is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter states that under the APA, burdens such as sanctions cannot be imposed without notice-and-comment.
The commenter argues that EPA provides no defense of its denial of public comment for findings of incompleteness and
cannot defend such denial for findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. The commenter further argues the judgment
of whether a SIP meets the SIP completeness criteria is often debatable and discretionary. Therefore, the commenter
argues, the public should be able to comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter believes that EPA's proposal contradicts the spirit and letter of the notice-and-comment provisions
in the Act. The commenter argues the proposal is contradictory on when it allows for public comment in some instances
but not others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, EPA maintains that notice and comment is not necessary for findings of failure to submit
and incompleteness. The 60 days the Act provides EPA to determine whether a State submittal is complete does not provide
sufficient time to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to making findings of failure to submit or findings
of incompleteness. The EPA continues to believe that the impossibility of conducting notice-and-comment rulemaking
within the 60 days provided for completeness decisions is itself compelling evidence that Congress did not intend
such rulemaking. Additionally, EPA does not believe that notice and comment are necessary for findings of incompleteness
because section 110(k)(1)(B) does not specifically require it. By enacting section 110(k)(1) on completeness,
Congress was codifying an EPA practice created in late 1989 in which EPA did not provide notice-and-comment rulemaking
before making incompleteness findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By codifying that practice and by not specifically requiring anything more than the process EPA already established,
Congress appears to have adopted EPA's established process of making completeness determinations by letter. Moreover,
EPA does not believe that the completeness determination is highly discretionary, but instead is a straightforward
exercise to assure a State's submittal has all the basic elements to warrant further review for overall adequacy.

Note that in promulgating the completeness criteria, EPA noted that the purpose of the completeness procedure is
to ``keep incomplete packages out of the more extensive review system (i.e., rulemaking for approval), thereby saving
both EPA and the State valuable time'' (54 FR 2138, 2139 (January 19, 1989)). Therefore, requiring rulemaking action
to determine whether a SIP submittal is complete would defeat the purpose of the completeness criteria, which is to
allow for a quick rejection of those submittals that are ``essentially unreviewable'' (

Regarding the APA, EPA continues to believe that even if EPA's findings of failure to submit and incompleteness were
subject to rulemaking procedures under the APA, the good cause exception applies to such findings for the reasons
discussed above. It would not be practicable to subject every completeness review to notice and comment because of
the limited time afforded by the statute. It would also not be in the public's interest because it would impose a tremendous
burden on the Agency and divert resources from more important substantive SIP reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the consistency comment, EPA believes that it is adhering to the notice-and-comment provisions of the
amended Act and the APA. Where it is appropriate, because the determination requires EPA judgment, EPA provides for
notice and comment (i.e., for SIP disapprovals or findings of nonimplementation). Additionally, as EPA has done
via this action, when EPA makes a sanction selection notice and comment are also provided. On the other hand, as discussed
above, in other cases sufficient time does not exist to provide for notice and comment and the determinations themselves
require little, if any, judgment. Finally, as discussed in section II.C.3., the final rule does not cover findings
of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) for part D SIP's (so-called SIP calls), which were covered by the
proposed rule, because of concerns about adequate notice and comment before sanctions are applied for State failure
to respond to a SIP call. The EPA intends to develop an alternative approach for applying mandatory sanctions for State
failure to respond to SIP calls that provides for notice and comment.

PM&hyph;10 Waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal did not address the PM&hyph;10 waiver provisions in section 188(f) of the Act. The commenter expresses
a frustration with the definition of PM&hyph;10 ``significance'' and argues that in the West, PM&hyph;10 levels
above the standard are caused predominately by fugitive dust and mobile sources. Therefore, the commenter believes,
applying 2-to-1 offsets to industrial sources will have a negligible effect on PM&hyph;10 24-hour concentrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A July 1992 draft addendum to the General Preamble (57 FR 31477, July 16, 1992) addresses several waiver policy issues,
including significance levels. The EPA believes the comment period for that policy, rather than this action selecting
sanctions, is the appropriate forum for comments on that issue. The EPA recognizes that in some nonattainment areas
industrial sources may be less significant contributors. In those cases, EPA may decide to apply the highway sanction
first, which this rule provides flexibility to do.

C. Summary of Changes in Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 52.31(a)_Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(a) sets forth the purpose of this rulemaking, which is to establish the sequence of sanctions required
to apply under section 179(a). The substance of this provision was not changed from the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 52.31(b)_Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(b) sets forth the definitions applicable under 40 CFR 52.31. The definitions of ``Act'' and ``1990
Amendments'' are not substantively changed. However, the citations for these two definitions were inadvertently
switched and they now correctly provide that the Act is located at 42 U.S.C. et seq. and the 1990 Amendments were set
forth in Public Law 101&hyph;549.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several definitions were added. Since the regulation provides that the offset sanction only applies
to the pollutant(s) that the finding concerns and its precursors, EPA has added a definition of ``precursors.'' The
EPA has also added a definition of ``ozone precursors'' which specifically identifies the two ozone precursors_VOC
and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has added a new definition for ``affected area.'' This term, while used in the proposed rule (e.g., the tables),
was not previously defined. Furthermore, its usage in the final rule has been expanded; in many places the word ``area''
has now been replaced by ``affected area.'' The definition provides that an ``affected area'' is the geographic area
subject to or covered by the Act requirement that is the subject of the finding and either, for purposes of the offset
and highway sanctions, is or is within an area designated nonattainment area pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7407(d) or, for
purposes of the offset sanction, is or is within an area otherwise subject to the emission offset requirements of 42
U.S.C. 7503. As used in this rule, in conjunction with &sect;52.31(e) (1) and (2), the affected area is the area potentially
subject to a sanction based on a finding. The new definition clarifies that the sanction applies to the geographic
area subject to or covered by the requirement at issue in the finding. This will usually be the entire designated area,
but in some instances may be a portion of a designated area. This point is made through the first portion of the definition.
Moreover, since the affected area is the area in which a sanction applies, it was necessary to limit the definition
to those areas that could be subject to a sanction. Therefore, the second portion of the definition restricts the definition
of ``affected area'' by incorporating the geographic limits of the highway and offset sanctions. First, the highway
sanction, as applied under section 179(a), is limited to nonattainment areas, since section 179(b)(1) provides
that the highway sanction may be ``applicable to a nonattainment area.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, by its terms, the offset sanction has effect only in those areas in which the offset requirements of section
173 are required to apply. (See 59 FR 1480 (January 11, 1994) for a further discussion of the geographic applicability
of section 179(b) sanctions.) This includes all nonattainment areas. In addition, some attainment and unclassified
areas (e.g., those located in the NOTR could be subject to the offset sanction, since those areas may be subject to the
offset requirements of section 173, even though they are not designated nonattainment (see section 184, for example).
Therefore, the second clause of the definition limits affected areas to nonattainment areas (which would be subject
to both the highway and offset sanction) and areas otherwise subject to the emission offset requirements of section
173 (which would be subject to the offset sanctions).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three examples illustrate how this definition applies. One, if EPA finds that a State fails to submit a PM&hyph;10
plan for a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area pursuant to section 189(a) and the State does not correct the deficiency
within 18 months, then, pursuant to this rule, the offset sanction shall apply in the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area
whose boundaries are described in 40 CFR part 81. If 6 months later the deficiency remains uncorrected, then the highway
sanction applies in the nonattainment area as well. In both cases the sanction applies only in the nonattainment area
because that is the geographic area covered by the Act requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two, if EPA finds a State fails to submit a required SIP revision under the Act for a requirement that applies to only
a portion of an area, then the sanctions apply to the portion of the area subject to the requirement and not the whole
area. For example, the enhanced inspection and maintenance plan requirement for serious, severe, and extreme nonattainment
areas applies only to ``each urbanized area (in the nonattainment area) as defined by the Bureau of the Census, with
a 1980 population of 200,000 or more'' (see section 182(c)(3)(A)). Section 184 provides that for all areas within
the NOTR, this requirement will apply to urbanized areas with a population in excess of 100,000. Therefore, this requirement
could apply to a smaller area within a designated nonattainment, attainment or unclassified area. If the State fails
to adopt the program for such an area, the section 179 sanctions would apply only to that smaller area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, if EPA finds that a State within the NOTR fails to submit a reasonably available control technology SIP for
VOC required pursuant to section 184(b)(1)(B) with respect to all the sources in the State subject to this requirement,
and the State does not correct the deficiency within 18 months, then, pursuant to this rule, the offset sanction would
apply in the entire State. If 6 months later the deficiency remained uncorrected, then the highway sanction would
apply to all of the nonattainment areas in the State. If there were no designated nonattainment areas within the State,
the highway sanction would not apply in that State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining definitions remain substantively unchanged from those in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 52.31(c)_Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(c) establishes the applicability of the final rule. The portions of &sect;52.31(c) setting forth
the findings that trigger the sanctions clock remain unchanged as these portions were taken directly from sections
179(a) (1)&hyph;(4). Generally, these findings are that a State has failed to submit a required SIP or SIP element,
has submitted a SIP or SIP element that does not meet EPA's completeness criteria, has submitted a SIP that is not approvable,
or that the State is failing to implement an approved SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portions of &sect;52.31(c) indicating the SIP requirements to which this rule applies have been modified. The
proposal indicated the rule covers any part D SIP or SIP revision required under the Act, or any part D SIP or SIP revision
required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5). This section of the final rule
has been modified to cover only part D SIP and SIP revisions and not calls for part D SIP's or SIP revisions under section
110(k)(5). The final rule does not cover part D SIP calls because of concerns about applying sanctions for State failures
to respond to such SIP calls following EPA nonsubmittal findings without opportunity for notice and comment. SIP
calls are currently not subject to notice-and-comment. The public and affected sources must be given notice and opportunity
to comment before SIP calls can have binding effect as a result of a section 179(a) finding that a State has failed to
submit a SIP in response to a SIP call. Thus, if this rule were to apply to State failures to respond to SIP calls, mandatory
sanctions could apply without an opportunity for such comment before new obligations become binding against affected
sources. This would be inconsistent with the APA requirements of section 553. Therefore, as discussed in section
II.C.3., the final rule does not cover part D SIP calls. The EPA will develop another approach to address SIP calls,
providing an opportunity for notice and comment before mandatory sanctions apply for a State failure to respond to
a SIP call.

4. Section 52.31(d)_Sanction Application Sequencing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(d)(1) is the heart of this rule in that it establishes the order in which the automatic sanctions under
section 179(a) shall apply. Several clarifications have been made to the section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One, this provision now requires affirmative EPA action to stop sanction clocks and lift sanctions following section
179(a) findings, including nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings. The EPA's proposed and final sanction clock
policy provides that, following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness, sanction clocks are permanently
stopped (and any sanctions applied are permanently lifted) when EPA finds the plan complete. Section 110(k)(1)(B)
provides that a submittal is deemed complete if a completeness finding is not made by EPA within 6 months of EPA's receipt
of the plan. Under this clarification to &sect;52.31(d), a SIP becoming complete by operation of law will not be sufficient
to stop sanction clocks or for an area to avoid sanctions. The EPA will need to affirmatively determine that the SIP
is complete in order for the sanction clock to stop and any sanctions to be lifted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy clarification will henceforth govern what is required to stop sanctions clocks and lift sanctions following
findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness, and the other section 179 findings. Prior to this policy clarification,
in certain cases EPA did stop sanction clocks started by EPA findings of failure to submit or incompleteness by SIP
submittals being deemed complete ``by operation of law.'' The EPA believes that this approach was consistent with
EPA guidance at the time and that it is appropriate to grandfather these areas under EPA's grandfathering guidance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that after consideration of its grandfathering policy for SIP requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is permissible to grandfather these cases from this policy clarification. The EPA's general grandfathering guidance
provides that SIP revisions will remain subject to the requirements in effect on the date that the State adopts the
SIP revision, provided a complete, fully adopted SIP revision is submitted promptly, generally within 60 days of
the adoption. Since the policy clarification is effective by this action and all of the SIP submittals in question
were adopted more than 60 days prior to September 6, 1994, under this general grandfathering, these cases are grandfathered.
However, the guidance includes several exceptions to the general guidance which must be addressed before an action
is considered by EPA to be grandfathered.

See ``'Grandfathering' of Requirements for Pending SIP Revisions,'' memorandum from Gerald A. Emison to Air Division
Director, Regions I&hyph;X, June 27, 1988. This memorandum has been entered in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first exception concerns the intent of the policy not to grandfather SIP's submitted hurriedly to avoid new requirements.
In the cases at issue, such action has not occurred on the part of the State since the States have received no early, formal
notification that the sanction clock policy is being clarified in the manner it is today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second exception to general guidance on grandfathering concerns situations where a court ruling has explicitly
changed a current Federal requirement or has convinced EPA that a previous requirement is no longer supportable.
Here no such court ruling is at issue so no exception should be made in this case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third exception is that the Administrator may determine that grandfathering is not appropriate under a new policy.
In this case, the Administrator is determining that grandfathering is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth exception indicates that grandfathering is not appropriate if it would have an imminent and substantial
adverse environmental effect or could permanently foreclose use of part D provisions such as sanctions. The EPA does
not believe that grandfathering these areas from this policy clarification will have an imminent and substantial
environmental impact given the limited number of areas and given that the States' submittals must be adequate to attain
and maintain the relevant NAAQS before EPA can approve them. In addition, this grandfathering does not permanently
foreclose the application of sanctions in these areas should EPA, through rulemaking, find the SIP submittals inadequate
to attain and maintain the NAAQS and disapprove them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth exception provides that action on a SIP revision which comports with the revised requirements but not the
original requirements may be based on the revised requirements. In this instance, this is indeed the case; conceivably,
one or more of those SIP's deemed complete by operation of law may have lacked one or more of the elements needed for EPA
to find a plan affirmatively complete. Nonetheless, EPA cannot fully approve a plan if any of the required completeness
elements are lacking. For example, if a SIP submittal lacks compliance/enforcement strategies, one of technical
elements required for completeness, then EPA could not fully approve the plan. Therefore, while EPA is grandfathering
these SIP submittals from completeness, EPA is not grandfathering these areas from having adequate SIP's to attain
and maintain the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth exception raises a concern as to whether grandfathering the SIP from the requirements in question would
render the SIP as a whole substantially inadequate. Grandfathering these SIP submittals from this policy does not
raise direct concern that doing so might render the SIP's substantially inadequate since the completeness review
is not a review intended to pass judgement on the adequacy of SIP's. Rather, it is intended as a straightforward exercise
to determine whether the SIP's contain all the technical and administrative elements to warrant further review.
As discussed above, if any of these SIP submittals deemed complete by operation of law lack any such elements, then
such deficiency will be reflected in EPA's determination as to the SIP's adequacy to attain and maintain the air quality
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The seventh exception concerns certain classes of changes which are only indirectly related to attainment and maintenance
of the air quality standards. Completeness reviews are only indirectly related to attainment and maintenance of
the standards in that the completeness review is not intended to be review of the SIP's adequacy to meet the standards.
Therefore, the grandfathering of these SIP submittals from the policy clarification satisfies this exception as
well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two, the phrase ``affected area'' has been substituted for ``area.'' This is to clarify that the sanction only applies
in affected areas, and not necessarily all areas for which EPA makes a section 179(a) finding. (See the discussion
of ``affected area'' under the definitions section above.) Three, the second sentence regarding highway sanctions
has been clarified to provide that correction of the deficiency ``forming the basis of the finding'' is needed to stop
the clock. This language is consistent with the language included in the proposal section 52.31(d)(1) for the offset
sanction in sentence 1 and consistent with the interpretation established in the preamble to the proposed rule at
pages 51272&hyph;51273. This revision merely clarifies what deficiency needs to be corrected in order to stop the
sanctions clock.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, a new final sentence has been added to the section. The sentence provides that for clocks started by rulemaking
actions (i.e., disapprovals and findings of failure to implement), the date of the finding starting the clock is the
``effective date'' of the action, not necessarily the date it is signed or the date it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since the disapproval or finding of failure to implement is not effective until the ``effective date'' of the final
action, the sanctions clock should not start until such action is effective. Upon further reflection, EPA determined
that the clarification should be included in the rule in order to ensure that the public is adequately apprised of when
the sanctions clock has started for particular areas based on a rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has revised the final rule to add new sections &sect;&sect;52.31(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4). In response to
comments, these sections incorporate a revision made to the rule concerning how and when sanctions, not yet applied,
may be deferred and sanctions, already applied, may be stayed. A complete discussion of the revisions is set forth
in section II.B.3. above. These corrections concern the circumstance where EPA has disapproved a required submittal
or where EPA has found that a State has failed to implement an approved SIP. Sections 52.31(d)(2) and 52.31(d)(3) set
forth language concerning disapproved SIP's and &sect;52.31(d)(4) sets forth the language regarding cases where
EPA has made a final finding of failure to implement. For purposes of an initial disapproval or an initial finding of
failure to implement for which EPA subsequently proposes a positive finding and issues an interim final rule finding
that the State has corrected the deficiency, any sanctions resulting from a clock that expires will be deferred and
any sanctions that have been applied will be stayed. (A final conditional approval would continue any stay or deferral
that resulted from a proposed conditional approval.) This change providing for a stay or deferral of sanctions does
not change the rule's requirement that sanctions and sanctions clocks are not permanently stopped until EPA issues
a final full approval or determination that a State is implementing its SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;52.31(d)(5) has been added which reaffirms what EPA actions are necessary for the mandatory sanctions
process to permanently cease. Specifically, it provides that any sanction clock will be permanently stopped and
sanctions applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming
the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding of failure
to submit or incompleteness, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from EPA to the governor.
For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a SIP disapproval, a finding that the deficiency
has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding
of nonimplementation, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 finding that the State is implementing the approved SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 52.31(d)(6) is essentially unchanged from &sect;52.31(d)(2) of the proposed rule. This section makes clear
that EPA may take rulemaking action in any specific circumstance to reverse the order in which sanctions will be applied
under section 179(a). In other words, EPA can take rulemaking action so that the highway sanction would apply after
18 months and the offset sanction 6 months thereafter. Two minor, nonsubstantive, changes were made. First, EPA replaced
the phrase ``the EPA'' with ``the Administrator.'' Second, EPA changed the term ``should'' to ``shall'' to more firmly
reflect the mandatory nature of the sanctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(e) sets forth the two sanctions that are applied by section 179(a). This rule, as did the proposed rule,
interprets in greater detail the offset sanction provided under section 179(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding &sect;52.31(e)(1), applicability of the offset sanction, there have been several changes that are intended
to more clearly capture the concepts in the proposed rule and the preamble to the proposed rule. The EPA has clarified
the applicability of the offset sanction to PM&hyph;10 precursors, modified the rule for PM&hyph;10 and ozone precursors,
and clarified the language in the rule regarding the pollutant applicability of the offset sanction when the SIP deficiency
in question is not specific to a pollutant or pollutants. A discussion of these changes in the context of the specific
sections follows.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has revised &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) in several ways. First, EPA has removed the offset sanction table from the
rule and decided to provide the public information on areas that will be potentially subject to sanctions in a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. As EPA makes clear elsewhere in this paragraph and the rule, the sanctions automatically apply in the timeframes
prescribed under &sect;52.31(d), unless EPA determines that the State has corrected the relevant SIP deficiency
forming the basis of the finding. The EPA never intended the inclusion of areas in a table in this rule to be necessary
for sanctions to apply automatically. The EPA does believe that it must provide the public with as accurate information
as possible on areas that may face sanctions and has elected to do so through notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than through a table in the body of the rule. Substantively, there is no difference in the sense that areas will
face sanctions in the timeframes prescribed under &sect;52.31(d) regardless of whether they are listed in a table
in the rule or listed in a separate notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA has added the clause ``in the timeframe prescribed under &sect;52.31(d) of this section on those affected
areas subject under &sect;52.31(d) to the offset sanction of this section.'' As noted above, sanctions apply automatically
regardless of whether there is a table in the rule listing the areas subject to sanctions. Thus, this change was made
to make it clear that the sanctions apply within the time frames set forth in &sect;52.31(d). To further clarify this
point, a second change to proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) was to delete ``following'' in the clause referencing the
offset ratio for pollutants and their precursors. The reason for this change is because the table has been deleted
and thus no areas will be listed. The first sentence of &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) continues to require that the 2 to 1 offsets
be achieved for the pollutant or pollutants and any precursors for which the finding is made. (For further discussion
of this issue, see section II.B.2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has added a second sentence to &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i). This sentence is partially derived from &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv)
of the proposed rule. The purpose of moving this sentence was to alleviate redundancy in the proposed rule. The first
sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) appeared to echo proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) by stating that offsets must be achieved for the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for
which the finding was made. Therefore, EPA has not included the first sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv)
in the final rule and has moved the second sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) to final &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i).
The sentence now located as the second sentence of &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) continues to provide that if the underlying
finding is not specific to one or more pollutants and their precursors, then the offset sanction shall apply to all
pollutants and, as relevant, their precursors for which the area is subject to the new source requirement of section
173 of the Act. (See section II.B.2. for further discussion of pollutant applicability of the offset sanction.) This
provision, of course, would apply to any area (nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified) that is the subject of
the finding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its entirety, then, &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) now provides: (1) That the emission offset sanction applies within
the time specified in &sect;52.31(d), even though the rule now contains no offset sanction table; (2) that the ratio
of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be 2:1; and (3) that the offset ratio shall apply to the one or more
pollutants and their precursors for which the &sect;52.31(c) finding was made or to all pollutants and their precursors
(for which the area is subject to the new source requirement of section 173 of the Act) if the finding was not pollutant
specific. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has added new &sect;52.31(e)(1)(ii) to specifically address the issue of findings made with respect to ozone
and its two precursors, VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This was discussed generally in the preamble to the proposed rule at page 51276, footnote 18, although no specific
language was included in the proposed rule. The Act establishes requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, some
of which are specific for either VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, since the general assumption is that both precursors are critical to ozone formation, EPA believes that
even though a finding may be specific as to one ozone precursor, the offset sanction should apply for both precursors.
However, there are two exceptions to this general requirement, both of which are based on the Act. First, affected
areas that are designated nonattainment for ozone but that are not classified as marginal, moderate, serious, severe
or extreme, are not required to achieve offsets under section 173 for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second exception is for affected areas that have received a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption from the NSR requirement pursuant to section 182(f). These two exceptions and the rationale for them are
discussed in section II.B.2. above. A new &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iii) sets up a similar provision with respect to PM&hyph;10
precursors, which is also discussed in more detail in section II.B.2. above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(e)(1)(iv) of the final rule has merely been renumbered. Section 52.31(e)(1)(iii) of the proposed
rule previously contained these requirements and substantially remains unchanged. The preamble to the proposed
rule at page 51276 provides that this section requires States to apply the offset sanction consistent with amended
section 173, regardless of whether the State has approved NSR rules consistent with section 173 requirements. The
purpose of this provision is to ensure that States that have been delinquent in meeting the NSR requirements of the
amended Act are not benefitted by applying sanctions in accordance with NSR rules that are more lenient than required
by the Act or by the absence of NSR requirements within the State. Under this section, therefore, all affected areas
subject to the offset sanctions would be subject to similar requirements in achieving those offsets, as specified
in the amended Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 52.31(e)(1)(v) of this rule is unchanged from &sect;52.31(e)(1)(v) of the proposed rule. The purpose of
this provision is to establish when the increased offset requirement will be applied. As noted in section II.B.2.
above, EPA received numerous comments on this issue. For purposes of applying the offset sanction, EPA had some flexibility
in determining what permits would be subject to the increased offset requirement. As noted in section II.B.2., numerous
commenters suggested other possibilities. For example, some suggested that the increased offset ratio only apply
to permits for which an application was received after the date the offset sanction applied. As stated more fully in
the detailed response to comments document located in the docket, EPA has determined that the offset sanction should
have immediate effects in affected areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 52.31(e)(2) of the final rule sets forth the highway sanction. Several revisions have been made to this section.
As with &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i), EPA has removed the highway sanction table from &sect;52.31(e)(2) of the proposed
rule for the same reasons discussed above for why the offset sanction table was removed. Similarly, &sect;52.31(e)(2)
includes new language that directly refers to the timing provisions of &sect;52.31(d). As with the similar revised
language in &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i), this is merely to clarify that the highway sanction applies with respect to the
times set forth in that subsection, even though the area is not listed in a table in the rule. In addition, a new sentence
has been added which specifies that the highway sanction only applies to affected areas that are also nonattainment
areas. Although this issue was not specifically addressed in the proposed rule, the proposed rule and the preamble
to the proposed rule referred back to the section 179(b)(1) highway sanction requirement of the Act (58 FR 51274, 51279;
&sect;51.32(e)(2) of the proposed rule.) Section 179(b)(1) states that ``[t]he Administrator may impose a prohibition,
applicable to a nonattainment area *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, EPA is incorporating this language, which
was merely referenced in the proposed rule, into the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179(a) provides that unless the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., nonsubmittal, disapproval, and
nonimplementation) has been corrected within the time periods prescribed therein one of the sanctions in section
179(b) ``shall apply, as selected by the Administrator.'' Under this final rule, sanctions will apply automatically
in the sequence prescribed herein in all instances in which mandatory sanctions are applied under section 179(a)
following findings under section 179(a)(1)&hyph;(4) for part D plans or plan revisions that EPA has already made
or that EPA will make in the future, except when EPA takes a separate action to reverse the sanction sequence. However,
if the sanction clock has expired for any findings before September 6, 1994, no sanction has yet applied since EPA interprets
section 179(a) to provide that sanctions shall not apply until EPA makes the sanction selection through notice-and-comment
rulemaking. Since this action constitutes the final sanction selection rulemaking, the offset sanction begins
to apply on any areas for which the sanction clock has elapsed on September 6, 1994. To understand the timing of the application
of mandatory sanctions in these cases, it is first necessary to clarify the discussion in the proposal at p. 51274 on
how the sanction clocks function under section 179(a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179(a) sets up two distinct sanction clocks. The Act states that if the State does not correct the deficiency
within 18 months after a finding, one of the two available sanctions shall apply, as selected by the Administrator.
It then provides that if the deficiency has not been corrected within 6 months thereafter, then both available sanctions
shall apply. The EPA interprets this to mean that the second sanction always follows 6 months from the actual application
of first, regardless of whether this would cause the application of the second sanction to be delayed beyond 24 months
from the date of the finding. Therefore, on September 6, 1994 the offset sanction shall apply on any area(s) for which
an 18-month sanction clock has elapsed and EPA has not determined that the State has not corrected the deficiency.
Both sanctions shall then apply 6 months from that date if EPA has not determined the deficiency has been corrected
by then. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA intends to notify States of the application and removal of section 179 mandatory sanctions (as provided for
in &sect;52.31(d) of this rule) before they apply. In addition, in its actions on submittals received after a section
179(a) finding, EPA will indicate what the effect of its action is on the sanctions clock and sanctions application.
The following discussion explains how this will occur, first providing the examples where, prior to 18 months, EPA
finally determines whether the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding, and then providing examples
where EPA finally determines the deficiency has been corrected after month 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cases where, prior to 18 months, EPA completes its action determining that the State has corrected the section
179(a) deficiency, sanctions would not apply. The following two examples address instances in which EPA finally
determines within 18 months of the finding that started the sanctions clock whether the State has corrected the deficiency
and how EPA's action finding the State corrected the deficiency affects the sanction clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case where, within 18 months following a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness, EPA determines whether
a State's SIP submittal corrects the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., is complete or incomplete), EPA will
inform the State of whether the sanctions clock is stopped when it sends the completeness or incompleteness letter
to the State. If the SIP submittal is incomplete, then the letter will indicate that the sanctions clock continues
and that automatic sanctions will apply as prescribed by this rule. If the SIP submittal is complete, then the letter
will indicate that the sanctions clock started by the prior finding of failure to submit or incompleteness permanently
stops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case where, within 18 months following a SIP disapproval or finding of nonimplementation, EPA determines whether
the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., whether the SIP is approvable or whether the nonimplementation
deficiency has been corrected), EPA will indicate whether the sanctions clock is stopped when it takes final rulemaking
action on the SIP.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 action will indicate that the sanctions clock continues and that automatic sanctions will apply as prescribed by
this rule. If EPA finally approves the SIP or finally determines that the nonimplementation deficiency has been corrected,
then the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 action will indicate that the sanctions clock started by the prior disapproval or finding of nonimplementation permanently

As discussed above in section II.B.1., proposed approval (or a proposal that the nonimplementation deficiency had
been corrected) following a SIP disapproval or nonimplementation finding has the effect of deferring and/or staying
the application of sanctions. In this case, though, such proposal action would not have a deferral and/or staying
effect because it is assumed (for the purposes of this example) that EPA completes final rulemaking action on the SIP
within 18 months.

The following examples address how, following the section 179(a) findings, the States will be kept informed when
EPA's actions on revised SIP's are not completed within 18 months of the finding's deficiency. As provided in this
rule at &sect;52.31(d)(1) through (4), in explaining how the States will be kept informed, these examples address
sanction removal, as well as sanction deferral and staying.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In EPA interim final determinations that the State has corrected the deficiency, issued simultaneously with EPA
proposed approvals and proposed findings that States are implementing their SIP's (after EPA SIP disapprovals or
findings of nonimplementation), EPA intends to notify interested parties, including States, of any deferral or
staying of sanctions that will result from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 actions proposing to approve SIP's or to find that the State is implementing its SIP, as provided for in &sect;52.31(d)(2),
(3) and (4) of this rule. In these cases, EPA will also indicate to all interested parties whether sanctions are removed,
apply or reapply when it takes subsequent final action on the plan in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If subsequently EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed, then in that action EPA will indicate that sanctions
apply or reapply, as appropriate, and what sanctions, if any, apply subsequently. If EPA subsequently fully approves
the revised plan, then in that action EPA will indicate that the sanctions clock permanently stops and that any sanctions
previously applied due to the original disapproval or finding of failure to implement are removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these letters and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 actions, the EPA will also periodically publish notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

are likely to be subject to the offset and highway sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If removal, staying, or deferral of sanctions is warranted, EPA will similarly provide the public with information
that sanctions have either been removed, stayed or deferred in the area. Finally, to supplement the various letters
and actions discussed above, EPA will provide information on the status of sanction 12 findings on EPA's Technology
Transfer Network (TTN).

In some cases, the letter and/or the action may be combined with another action relating to the submittal. For example,
if following a disapproval EPA proposes to approve a SIP at month 20 after the offset sanction is in place, the interim
final determination issued simultaneously with the proposed approval action would also serve to notify the public
that application of the offset sanction has been stayed.

B. Areas Potentially Subject to Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has made section 179(a) findings of failure to submit and incompleteness for numerous submittals due under
the amended Act. As explained in section II.C.5 above, EPA has elected to provide the public with information on areas
potentially subject to sanctions in a separate notice that appears in the notice section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than in tables in today's rule. Therefore, for further information on areas likely to face sanctions on September
6, 1994 see that other notice.

IV. Miscellaneous

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (Order), (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of the Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory actions'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interface with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel or policy issues arising out of legal mandates,
the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Order, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory action''
within the meaning of the Order. The EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB
suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal includes a discussion of the impact of the rule on small entities at pages 51277&hyph;8. The regulatory
flexibility analysis (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 600 et seq.) requires Federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts
of Federal regulations upon small entities. Agencies are required to perform an RFA where the significant impacts
are possible on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and governmental entities with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this action will have some impact, an initial RFA was prepared pursuant to EPA guidelines, which has been placed
in the docket to this rulemaking. For the following three reasons, EPA believes the impact of this rule on small entities
will be limited. First, any impact that may occur from the offset sanction is limited to sources defined as ``major''
for nonattainment NSR purposes, generally 100 tons per year (TPY) or more of a criteria pollutant, except in the more
serious ozone nonattainment areas. The major sources most likely to also be small entities as defined pursuant to
the RFA are in these more serious ozone areas where the major source TPY threshold has been lowered under part D of title
I of the Act. Second, the amended Act also increases the nonattainment NSR offset ratio in the ozone nonattainment
areas. The ratio ranges from 1.1-to-1 to 1.5-to-1, depending on the severity of the area's classification. Thus,
any impact the 2-to-1 offset sanction will have may not be as significant in precisely those ozone nonattainment areas
where small entities that are also major sources are most likely to exist. Third, as stated above, the only relevant
impact period is 6 months in duration, since after that period the State will either have become subject to both sanctions
or have corrected the deficiency and been relieved from any sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section II.B.1. of this document includes several comments concerning the impact of the proposed rule. One additional
comment is summarized here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter states that the lowering of the major source threshold under the Act exposes many more small sources
to control and the likelihood of sanctions. The commenter believes that many such small sources are small businesses
and that, contrary to the analysis in the proposal, an increase in the offset ratio of 0.5 could have a significant impact
on the ability of businesses to find adequate offsets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that the final rule will have some impact on small entities. The lowering of the major source threshold
could expose more sources to the offset sanction. The EPA does not disagree that in individual cases an increase in
the offset ratio could have a significant impact on a small business. However, EPA believes that the impact of this
rule on small entities will be limited for the second and third reasons discussed above. Additionally, EPA notes that
the impact of this rule will also be lessened by the provision in final rules that provides for the deferral and/or staying
of the application of sanctions in certain instances when EPA believes it is more likely than not a deficiency has been
corrected (see discussion in section II.B.3. of this document). However, because this action will have some impact,
a final RFA has been prepared pursuant to EPA guidelines, which has been placed in the docket to this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under the section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from
between 1-to-1 and 1.5-to-1. When the offset sanction applies, it should not impose an additional information collection
burden because sources will not have to provide any information in permit applications beyond that which is already
required in the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended
Act for nonattainment NSR and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being
prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the highway sanction applies, the Secretary of DOT is required to determine which projects or grants should not
be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are exempt. This determination will be based on information readily
available in existing documentation gathered for the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic
impacts of different alternatives for transportation projects. These analyses are required for the preparation
of environmental assessments and impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), (42 U.S.C.
sec. 4321 et seq.). Historically, exemption determinations by DOT for sanctions have been based on such NEPA documentation
and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis by the States. In addition, since under
NEPA final environmental documents must be approved by DOT, in most cases the NEPA documentation will already be in
DOT's possession. Therefore, EPA does not believe that the highway sanction, when applied, will impose an additional
information collection burden on the States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section shall apply to any State in which an affected area is located and for which the Administrator has made one
of the following findings, with respect to any part D SIP or SIP revision required under the Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A finding that a State has failed, for an area designated nonattainment under 42 U.S.C. 7407(d), to submit a plan,
or to submit one or more of the elements (as determined by the Administrator) required by the provisions of the Act applicable
to such an area, or has failed to make a submission for such an area that satisfies the minimum criteria established
in relation to any such element under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A disapproval of a submission under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k), for an area designated nonattainment under 42 U.S.C. 7407(d),
based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the provisions of the Act applicable
to such an area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) A determination that a State has failed to make any submission required under the Act, other than one described
under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, including an adequate maintenance plan, or has failed to make any
submission, required under the Act, other than one described under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, that
satisfies the minimum criteria established in relation to such submission under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(1)(A); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A disapproval in whole or in part of a submission described under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A finding that any requirement of an approved plan (or approved part of a plan) is not being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Sanction Application Sequencing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in an affected
area 18 months from the date when the Administrator makes a finding under paragraph (c) of this section unless the Administrator
affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. To further implement
42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in an affected area 6 months
from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator affirmatively
determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For the findings under paragraphs
(c)(2), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(4) of this section, the date of the finding shall be the effective date as defined in the
final action triggering the sanctions clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the
findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct
the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to fully
or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects
the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole
or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under
paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator issues
such a proposed or final disapproval, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway
sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency
forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency
prompting the finding and after 18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully or
conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects
the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless
and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator
issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval. The highway
sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date
the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator
determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the proposed
or final disapproval occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1)
of this section.

the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-approved
the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting
the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and

under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the approval becomes a disapproval
or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable. The highway sanction
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines
that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the conditional approval
becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable,
more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency
prompting the finding and after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised
plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding,
application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval
or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits
to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval
or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this
section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date
the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval,
whichever is applicable.

(4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to
find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency
prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or
final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected
the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the
deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later
of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation
has not been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines
that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator
has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination
that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph
(e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section
shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or
final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected
the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the
deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date
the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has
not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on
the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected
area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the
finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected
occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find
that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency
prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator
preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the
approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily
or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1)
of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area
on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation
has not been corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions
applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming the basis
of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs
(c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from the
Administrator to the State governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur
through a final notice in the

(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in this section will prohibit the Administrator from
determining through notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway sanction, rather
than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph
(c) of this section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, shall apply 6 months from the date
the highway sanction applies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)&hyph;(e)(1)(vi) of this section, the State shall apply the emissions
offset requirement in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject
under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements
in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least two units of emission reductions for each unit
of increased emissions of the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding(s) under paragraph (c)
of this section is (are) made. If the deficiency prompting the finding under paragraph (c) of this section is not specific
to one or more particular pollutants and their precursors, the 2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants (and their
precursors) for which an affected area within the State listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is required
to meet the offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding is made with respect to a requirement for
the criteria pollutant ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions
offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides
where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding under paragraph (c) of this section is
made with respect to PM&hyph;10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions
offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions to PM&hyph;10 precursors
if the Administrator has determined under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors
do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required
under this section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted new source review (NSR) program
that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515,
as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment
area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing
permits to construct and operate major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For purposes of applying
the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where EPA has not fully approved a State's NSR program as meeting the requirements
of part D, the specifications of those provisions shall supersede any State requirement that is less stringent or
inconsistent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. 7503 and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under paragraph (d) of this section shall
be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 107(b) of the Americans with Disabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1990 (ADA) requires that the Department of Justice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Department), the Equal Employment Opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission (the Commission or the EEOC), and the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue regulations setting forth procedures to coordinate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints that fall within the overlapping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of title I of the ADA and the Rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, to ensure that such complaints are dealt with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this mandate, the Department of Justice and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC are publishing a joint final rule implementing section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
107(b) as it pertains to title I of the ADA and section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In addition, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation describes the existing procedures for processing: Employment complaints that fall within the overlapping

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of title II of the ADA and either title I or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or both; and employment complaints that arise solely under title I or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504. A joint final rule developed by the EEOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department of Labor implementing section 107(b) as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertains to title I and section 503 of the Rehabilitation

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12111&hyph;12117, prohibits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination against qualified individuals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities in all aspects of employment. Title I of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADA became effective on July 26, 1992, with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers with 25 or more employees. 42 U.S.C. 12111(5)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 26, 1994, this coverage will be extended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers with 15 or more employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EEOC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized to investigate and attempt to resolve charges of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment discrimination under title I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle A of title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12131&hyph;12134, prohibits discrimination against qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local governmental entities in their services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, and activities, including employment. As of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 26, 1992, the effective date of title II, all State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and local governmental entities, regardless of the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons they employ, were prohibited from discriminating on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of disability in employment. The Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justice has issued a regulation implementing title II, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that eight designated Federal agencies shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate and attempt to resolve complaints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination under title II. Complaints that arise solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title II are investigated by the designated agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most closely related to the functions exercised by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental component against which the complaint is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lodged. See 28 CFR part 35 (56 FR 35694, July 26, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended, 29 U.S.C. 794, prohibits discrimination on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of disability (formerly, ``handicap'') in programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities receiving Federal financial assistance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted by any Executive agency. The nondiscrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of section 504 are applicable to employment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federally-assisted programs. Each Federal agency that

extends Federal financial assistance is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with section 504 in the programs it funds. More

than twenty-five Federal agencies have issued regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing section 504 for their Federally-assisted

programs. These agencies are referred to in this rule as

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substantive prohibitions and coverage of title I, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title II, and section 504 overlap to a significant extent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is, therefore, a potential for duplicative efforts by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the many Federal agencies responsible for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with these laws in their processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints. Thus, pursuant to section 107(b) of the ADA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department and the Commission are promulgating this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
joint final rule to establish procedures for coordinating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of complaints that fall within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlapping jurisdiction of section 504 and title I of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADA. For convenience and clarity in processing complaints, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule also incorporates the provisions established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's title II rule at 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2)&hyph;(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for coordinating the processing of complaints against public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities: (i) that fall within the jurisdiction of title II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and title I (but are not covered by section 504); and (ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are covered by title II, but not title I (whether or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not they are also covered by section 504). This reiteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of title II procedures does not amend or change the title II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation as previously published. The Commission does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
express an opinion on the title II procedures set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herein, since they merely repeat a previously published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation over which the Commission has no direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. The Commission and the Department of Labor also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have published joint rules implementing section 107(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ADA as it pertains to title I and section 503 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act. See 29 CFR part 1641, 41 CFR part 60&hyph;742 (57 FR 2960, January 24, 1992).

Analysis of Comments and Revisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission received ten comments in response to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published jointly with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department of Justice on April 21, 1992. 57 FR 14630. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission received comments from various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected Federal agencies on both the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and on the draft final regulation, pursuant to interagency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination under Executive Order 12067. The Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Department of Justice have carefully considered all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the comments and made various revisions in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. A number of commenters expressed reservations about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the feasibility of the procedures set forth in the NPRM and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested various alternative procedures. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters strongly urged that procedures similar to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in the regulation promulgated to coordinate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints of employment discrimination filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against recipients of federal financial assistance be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. See 28 CFR part 42; 29 CFR part 1691 (hereinafter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title VI/title VII regulation). The title VI/title VII 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation established procedures for handling complaints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment discrimination filed against recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal financial assistance subject to title VI of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1972, the State and Local Fiscal Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1972, as amended, and other provisions of Federal law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that prohibit discrimination on grounds of race, color, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
religion, sex, or national origin, in programs or activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving Federal financial assistance, when there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlapping jurisdiction under title VII of the Civil Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1964. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the NPRM's ``first filed approach,'' the EEOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any section 504 agency with jurisdiction over a charge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint would process those charges or complaints that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were actually filed with it, pursuant to title I of the ADA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or section 504, respectively. In the case of a charge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint that was physically filed with both the EEOC and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agency with jurisdiction, the agency that first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received the complaint or charge would process it, absent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special circumstances, while the second agency would defer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing pending the conclusion of the first agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation. Numerous section 504 agencies expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern about the practical difficulties inherent in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM's approach, including ascertaining which agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually received a charge or complaint first in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a charge or complaint filed with both the EEOC and a section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504 agency. Accordingly, as suggested by a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, the final regulation adopts an approach similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that of the title VI/title VII regulation. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, a complaint solely alleging employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination against a single individual (hereinafter, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual complaint) that is filed with a section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency with jurisdiction over the complaint will ordinarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be transferred to the EEOC for processing, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complainant specifically requests processing by the section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504 agency. Section 504 agencies, however, will retain for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing any complaints that allege: (i) a pattern or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of discrimination in employment; or (ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination both in employment and in other services or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices of a respondent that are covered by section 504. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

.6, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM presented two options regarding the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to be applied by section 504 agencies, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the NPRM discussed the rationale for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. Although numerous comments on these options were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in response to the NPRM, recent amendments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act have resolved this issue. See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
506 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;569, 106 Stat. 4344. Therefore, as provided in
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment, the final regulation directs section 504 agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to apply the standards of title I of the ADA. See the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.12, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also requested that time frames for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints be added to the final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because, in certain cases, individual agencies may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that preclude meeting fixed time frames for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain stages of the complaint investigation process, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion has not been adopted. For example, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure of the complainant's identity is necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the investigation of a section 504 or title II complaint, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department requires receipt of a signed consent form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the complainant prior to notifying a respondent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department has received a complaint of discrimination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the final regulation retains the more general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that agencies act promptly and in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various commenters also noted the inefficiency of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a section 504 agency refer a complaint to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Civil Rights Division for a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction when the agency does not have section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction, but does have title II jurisdiction. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, the regulation has been revised to require that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint be referred to the Civil Rights Division only when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section 504 agency that initially receives the complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has neither section 504 nor title II jurisdiction.

.1 of the final rule, ``Purpose and application,'' explains that the rule establishes the coordination procedures
to be followed by the Federal agencies responsible for processing complaints of employment discrimination filed
against recipients of Federal financial assistance and arising under section 504 and title I of the ADA. In addition
to establishing those new procedures, the rule also restates and integrates into one comprehensive regulation those
provisions of the Department's existing title II regulation that established the procedures for coordinating the
processing of complaints covered by title II of the ADA and either title I or section 504, or both. The rule does not amend
the title II regulation, but simply locates all of the applicable regulations regarding coordination in a single
source.

program or activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, both of which relate to the determination of whether jurisdiction exists under section 504, have been revised from
those contained in the NPRM. The NPRM originally contained a detailed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal financial assistance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, in recognition of the fact that this definition may vary among section 504 agency regulations due to the nature
of financial assistance provided by each agency, the new definition simply refers to the definitions adopted by each
section 504 agency in its regulation implementing section 504 for Federally-assisted programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
program or activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under section 504 was modified by the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;259, 102 Stat. 29, for
all section 504 agencies. Therefore, to avoid any inconsistency between this rule and any agency regulations implementing
section 504 that may not have been amended to reflect this change to the Rehabilitation Act, the new definition references
the statutory definition.

Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 describes the basic procedures that section 504 agencies and the agencies designated to process complaints under
the Department's title II regulation will follow in determining whether to process an employment complaint or to
refer it to another agency. The primary purpose of the rule is to establish procedures for coordinating the processing
of complaints or charges of employment discrimination arising under section 504 and title I of the ADA. However, the
procedures for coordinating the processing of complaints or charges of employment discrimination against public
entities: (i) that fall under the jurisdiction of title II and title I (but not section 504); and (ii) that fall under
the jurisdiction of title II, but not title I (whether or not covered by section 504) established by &sect;35.171 of
the Department's title II regulation, have been restated here and integrated with the section 504 processing procedures
for clarity and ease in processing by the affected agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 has been revised to eliminate the requirement that the initial receiving agency, or the Civil Rights Division,
when a complaint is forwarded to it for a determination of jurisdiction, provide notice to the affected parties. As
previously written, the regulation required notification by any agency that came into contact with a complaint or
charge even if the complaint or charge was immediately forwarded to another agency. Instead of multiple notifications,
the final rule now provides for a more efficient single notification at such time as the appropriate processing agency
receives the complaint or charge, in accordance with agency policy and applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 has been revised to provide that, if an agency determines pursuant to paragraph (a) that it does not have jurisdiction
under section 504 or title II, and that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction under title I, the agency shall promptly
refer the complaint to the Civil Rights Division. This is a change from the procedure set forth in the NPRM, which required
a section 504 agency to refer all title II complaints to the Civil Rights Division. The revision was made in response
to various comments pointing out that this was an inefficient procedure when the section 504 agency was certain that
it was the designated agency under title II, and that the complaint would be referred back to it by the Civil Rights Division.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt of a referred complaint, the Civil Rights Division will determine whether another Federal agency may
have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 (that is, a Federal agency may be providing financial assistance
to the respondent) or under title II (that is, the entity that is the subject of the complaint may be a public entity).
When the Civil Rights Division finds such jurisdiction, it shall promptly refer the complaint to the appropriate
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 sets forth the circumstances under which an agency that is a section 504 agency, a designated agency, or both, will
promptly refer a complaint to the EEOC for investigation and processing. In addition to: (i) revising the regulation
to reflect the procedures of the title VI/title VII regulation (which generally results in individual complaints
being referred for processing to the EEOC); and (ii) incorporating the procedures already established by the title
II regulation, paragraph (c) and the balance of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 more specifically set forth the requirements for either referral or retention applicable to each type of agency.
Unlike the procedural scheme set forth in the NPRM, under which a complaint or charge could only be dual filed if it were
actually filed with both a section 504 agency and the EEOC, a complaint or charge filed with one agency will now be deemed
to be dual filed under both title I and section 504 under certain circumstances, as set forth in this section and in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 describes the rule applicable to an agency that receives a complaint of employment discrimination under section
504 or title II and determines that it does not have jurisdiction over the complaint. If the agency determines that
the EEOC may have jurisdiction, the agency is required to promptly forward the complaint to the EEOC for processing.
In certain instances this may require consultation with the EEOC. This paragraph establishes the requirements for
section 504 and other agencies and includes the requirements established by &sect;35.171(b)(2) of the title II regulation
with respect to designated agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) establishes the referral requirements applicable to section 504 agencies and requires a section
504 agency that otherwise has jurisdiction over a complaint of employment discrimination to refer the complaint
to the EEOC when the complaint solely alleges discrimination against an individual, unless the EEOC lacks jurisdiction
over the complaint under title I, or the complainant requests that the section 504 agency retain jurisdiction, either
independently, or following receipt of the notice letter described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referral to the EEOC of complaints solely alleging employment discrimination against individuals is a significant
change in procedure from the NPRM. The revision was made in response to numerous comments urging this approach, which
is consistent with the title VI/title VII regulation. This approach will serve to minimize duplicative efforts because
the EEOC, in general, will be the primary agency investigating individual complaints of disability discrimination
in employment. An individual's private right of action under title I of the ADA will also be preserved under this approach,
since these section 504 complaints also will be deemed to be dual filed under title I. However, in order to preserve
an individual's right to have his or her complaint processed by the section 504 agency, paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) requires
the section 504 agency to retain the complaint for investigation if the complainant so requests.

Paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) describe the notice letter a section 504 agency is required to send promptly
to each complainant before the agency refers a complaint solely alleging employment discrimination against an individual
to the EEOC. The purpose of the letter is to inform an individual who has initially filed his or her complaint with the
appropriate section 504 agency of the basic implications of a referral of that complaint to the EEOC. It is anticipated
that the vast majority of individual complaints will be referred to the EEOC, with the section 504 agency deferring
its review and processing until the conclusion of the EEOC's processing. However, because an automatic referral
to the EEOC of a complaint filed with a section 504 agency may be contrary to the complainant's expectations, complainants
will be given the choice of having the EEOC or the section 504 agency investigate the complaint.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each agency will develop its own letter informing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complainant that the agency will refer the complaint to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC for investigation and processing, unless the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a written request to the contrary from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complainant within twenty days of the date of the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter. The agency notice letter shall explain: (i) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's procedures for processing section 504 complaints; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (ii) the EEOC's procedures for processing complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title I. The agency notice letter shall also inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals of the potential for differing remedies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3) describes the procedure for referral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by designated agencies, as established by &sect;35.171(b)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title II regulation. If a designated agency does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have section 504 jurisdiction, and determines that the EEOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have title I jurisdiction, it shall promptly refer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint to the EEOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4)(i) provides that complaints referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the EEOC by an agency with section 504 jurisdiction will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be deemed to be dual filed under both section 504 and title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. As a consequence, the section 504 agency, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to defer its processing of the complaint, will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an opportunity to review the EEOC's findings and take any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further action it deems appropriate, as provided in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) further provides that a complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to the EEOC by an agency that has jurisdiction over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complaint under title II only (and not under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504) will be treated as a complaint filed under title I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only. See 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction between the treatment of these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of complaints, those falling within the province of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 and those arising only under the ADA, is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the ADA's statutory mandate to preserve the rights, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, and procedures of any Federal law that provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than are afforded by the ADA. Permitting section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to review complaints originally filed with those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies preserves section 504 remedies, including an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's prerogative to terminate the federal funding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent. It is anticipated that the fact that fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination is ultimately available as an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy will encourage respondents to resolve valid claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through negotiation with the EEOC rather than through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litigation. Because &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10(c) requires the reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agency to give due weight to the EEOC's findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conclusions, it is also anticipated that, in most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, further action by the section 504 agency will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4)(iii) states that any complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to the EEOC shall be processed pursuant to title I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. Specifically, the EEOC will notify respondents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its receipt of a complaint in accordance with its usual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for notification following receipt of a charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

.6 describes the circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under which an agency shall retain a complaint for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation (rather than referring it to the EEOC or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Rights Division). The general rule applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agencies, as stated in paragraph (d)(1), is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a section 504 agency shall retain a complaint when it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that it has section 504 jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint and that any one or more of the following are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
true: (i) the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint; (ii) the EEOC has jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint, but the complainant requests that the complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be investigated by the agency rather than being referred; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the complaint alleges discrimination in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment and in other services or practices of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent that are covered by section 504; or (iv) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint alleges a pattern or practice of discrimination in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment. Such complaints will not be deemed dual filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title I of the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedure is consistent with the approach taken in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title VI/title VII regulation. For reasons of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency, section 504 agencies will ordinarily process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints that allege disability discrimination in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment and other practices of a recipient, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC has no jurisdiction over the latter. Historically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under both section 504 and other civil rights statutes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies have also had a particular interest in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement of pattern or practice cases of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination against recipients of Federal assistance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies shall continue to investigate such complaints. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be noted that the term ``pattern or practice'' of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination is intended to mean systemic or class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints generally. Although the term ``pattern or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice'' of discrimination is sometimes used in a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow sense to refer to intentional discrimination or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disparate treatment on a classwide level, the term was used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the title VI/title VII rule to refer to both adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact cases and cases of intentional discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting a class of protected individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions described above only apply when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint is filed with a section 504 agency. The EEOC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always process all charges, including class charges, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are solely filed with the EEOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) restates the principle established in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title II regulation that an agency shall retain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint for investigation when it determines that: (i) it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has jurisdiction over the complaint as a designated agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (ii) that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint under title I. See 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2).

.7 outlines the procedures that the EEOC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take in determining whether to process a charge or to refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it to another agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section .7(a)(1) requires the EEOC, as a first step, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the EEOC has jurisdiction, it shall process the charge in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with its customary title I procedures, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification of the respondent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) sets forth the procedures that apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the EEOC determines that it does not have jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the charge. Under such circumstances, the charge will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be promptly forwarded to the Civil Rights Division for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral to the appropriate agency, or retention by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department for processing, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.7 states the basic rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to charges filed with the EEOC, that is, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC determines that it has jurisdiction over the charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title I, it shall retain the charge. Because EEOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of a charge filed with the EEOC is consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the charging party's expectations when filing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge, no notice letter to the charging party, similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the letter required to be sent to complainants under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of &sect;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.6, is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) has been newly added to the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. It provides that the EEOC shall refer to a section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504 agency for further action, as appropriate, any cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding against a recipient that has failed conciliation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the EEOC has declined to litigate. By providing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency review under these circumstances, paragraph (b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should promote the ADA's statutory goal of preserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 remedies, while the requirement that section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies give due weight to EEOC findings should eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any need for duplicative agency action.

and section 504 agencies shall follow in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints or charges of employment discrimination that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been dual filed with both the EEOC and a section 504 agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.8 sets forth the procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to complaints or charges of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination that are dual filed with both a section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency and the EEOC, both of which have jurisdiction over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complaint or charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under those circumstances, the rule follows the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern established by the title VI/title VII regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and requires the EEOC to process charges that solely allege 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment discrimination against an individual when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual has not elected section 504 agency processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 agencies will process all complaints that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allege: (i) discrimination in both employment and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices or services of the respondent; (ii) a pattern or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of employment discrimination; or (iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination solely against an individual, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual has elected section 504 agency processing. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of responsibility for complaint processing is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same as the allocation of responsibility for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints originally filed solely with a section 504 agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.8 sets forth exceptions to this general scheme for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) requires complaints or charges to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to the Civil Rights Division if both the EEOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section 504 agency determine that they do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction over the complaint or charge. The Civil Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Division is then responsible for making the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral to a section 504 or designated agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) requires the EEOC and each agency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction under section 504 to develop procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether complaints or charges of discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been filed with the EEOC and with one or more agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the Department, the Commission, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section 504 agencies will work together to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, such as a uniform filing form (or uniform portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a filing form) that will facilitate coordination in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing employment complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although some commenters requested that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures be stated in the final rule, it was decided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this activity is more appropriately conducted at a sub-regulatory level, which will permit more flexibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing efficient procedures. In addition, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule has been restructured to follow the title VI/title VII 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation rather than the ``first-filed'' approach, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less need to determine whether a complaint or charge has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been filed with more than one agency. For example, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title VI/title VII model, the EEOC will become the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary agency processing complaints or charges that solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allege discrimination against an individual. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no need to determine whether these complaints or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges have been dual filed in order to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for processing. In addition, the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter required to be sent to section 504 complainants prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to such a referral should provide an efficient mechanism for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether a charge has also been filed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC because it could be used to require complainants to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveal whether they had filed a complaint or charge with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another agency.

Paragraph (d) requires the agency that will process a dual-filed complaint or charge to notify all concerned parties
that the other agencies will be deferring their processing, and of the possibility of further action by such agencies
pursuant to &sect;&sect;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) establishes that, under certain special circumstances where deferral may be inappropriate, the agencies
involved may jointly agree to reallocate investigatory responsibilities. For example, if the section 504 agency
would normally process the complaint, but the agency does not receive information that another charge has been filed
with the EEOC until after an investigation has been started by the EEOC, this exception permits the agencies jointly
to decide that the EEOC should continue processing the charge and that the section 504 agency should defer further
action. This exception could also be used in connection with subsequent complaints or charges, such as allegations
of retaliation, related to the original complaint or charge. The special circumstances listed in paragraph (e) are
illustrative and agencies may agree to reallocate investigatory responsibilities under other appropriate circumstances.
In such circumstances a complaint or charge will be treated as a deferred complaint or charge with respect to any right
to review under &sect;&sect;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not anticipated that most aggrieved individuals will separately file with both a section 504 agency and the EEOC.
Since the substantive protections provided by title I and section 504 are now identical, an individual's rights against
discrimination on the basis of disability can be vindicated under either statute. However, an individual who files
a complaint with a section 504 agency alleging discrimination both in employment and services, a pattern or practice
of discrimination, or who requests section 504 processing, will not preserve a private right of action under title
I of the ADA, unless the individual also files a charge with the EEOC under title I of the ADA.

section 504. If another agency has sole jurisdiction over the complaint under either section 504 or title I (and the
complaint was actually filed with that agency under section 504 or title I), &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.9 requires the designated agency to forward the complaint to that agency. If a section 504 agency and the EEOC both
have jurisdiction over a complaint or charge of employment discrimination, the rule allocates complaint-processing
responsibility according to the established pattern of the title VI/title VII rule, that is, individual complaints
are forwarded to the EEOC and complaints alleging discrimination in both employment and in other practices or services
of the respondent or a pattern or practice of employment discrimination are forwarded to the section 504 agency with
jurisdiction.

.10 describes the steps that shall be taken when the EEOC processes a dual-filed complaint or charge (either an individual
complaint that is referred to the EEOC or a dual-filed complaint or charge that the EEOC processes) and a section 504
agency defers its investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule requires the section 504 agency to defer action until the EEOC resolves the complaint, paragraph
(a) outlines the different ways in which any title I charge may be resolved, including litigation by the EEOC. Although
the EEOC is the agency primarily responsible for the enforcement of title I, resolution by the Civil Rights Division
is also included under paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) because, under title I of the ADA, when there is a cause finding pursuant
to 29 CFR 1601.21, the Civil Rights Division has litigation authority for charges against State and local governments,
government agencies, and political subdivisions. See 29 CFR 1601.29. The Civil Rights Division is also responsible
for issuing right-to-sue letters in such cases. See 29 CFR 1601.28(d).

Paragraph (b) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10 provides that, upon resolution of the dual-filed complaint or charge, the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division shall
inform the section 504 agency of the resolution. Paragraph (d) provides that, upon written request by the section
504 agency, the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division shall provide the section 504 agency with the materials necessary
to evaluate its resolution of the case, such as investigative reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10 provides that, upon receipt of notification from the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division, as appropriate, the section
504 agency shall determine what further action is warranted. Because, pursuant to the 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation
Act, the substantive standards to be applied to complaints of employment discrimination are now identical, it is
anticipated that, except in rare circumstances, the section 504 agency's findings and conclusions as to whether
a violation has occurred will be consistent with those of the EEOC and those of the Civil Rights Division, as applicable.
In order to further promote consistency and avoid duplication of effort, the rule requires that the section 504 agency
accord due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC and the Civil Rights Division, as applicable. The term
``due weight'' is adopted from the title VI/title VII regulation, which is referenced in section 107(b) of the ADA.
28 CFR part 42, subpart H; 29 CFR part 1691. In giving due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC or the Civil
Rights Division, a section 504 agency shall give such full and careful consideration to the findings and conclusions
as is appropriate, taking into account such factors as: (i) the extent to which the underlying investigation is complete
and the evidence supports the findings and conclusions; (ii) the nature and results of any subsequent proceedings;
(iii) the extent to which the findings, conclusions and any actions taken under title I are consistent with the effective
enforcement of section 504; and (iv) the agency's responsibilities under section 504.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, if the agency proposes to take an action that is inconsistent with such findings and conclusions, the section
504 agency is required to provide written notification of the action that it proposes to take and the basis for that
action to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, the Chairman of the EEOC, and the head of the
EEOC office that processed the complaint or charge. This is intended to enable the agencies to identify and resolve
any potentially conflicting or inconsistent standards before they are imposed and to prevent duplication of effort.

What further action the section 504 agency will take will depend on the EEOC's (or, as appropriate, the Civil Rights
Division's) findings, conclusions, and resolution. This rule contemplates that in most cases the ``further action''
would be that the section 504 agency would notify the complainant and the respondent that it is closing its file based
upon the EEOC's resolution of the charge. For example, closure by the section 504 agency would be the appropriate action
when: (i) the EEOC found no cause and issued a right-to-sue letter, and the section 504 agency agreed with the determination
that no violation occurred; or (ii) the EEOC found cause and the violation was completely remedied through either
a conciliation agreement or litigation, and the section 504 agency agreed that the violation had been remedied.

action'' would be that the EEOC would notify the charging party and the respondent that it is closing its file based
upon the resolution of the complaint by the section 504 agency, and, where appropriate, would issue a right-to-sue
letter. For example, closure and issuance of a right-to-sue letter by the EEOC would be the appropriate action when
the section 504 agency found no violation and the EEOC agreed. Alternatively, closure alone would be appropriate
when the section 504 agency found a violation and the EEOC agreed that the violation was completely remedied through
either a conciliation agreement, an administrative hearing, or judicial enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, this section addressed the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by section 107(b) of the ADA to ``[prevent] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same requirements under [title I and section 504].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, in order to comply with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory mandate, the NPRM presented two options for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal standard to be applied by section 504 agencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their investigation of complaints that are also subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title I, and requested comment as to the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. However, in the period between the publication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPRM and the publication of this final rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act was specifically amended to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards of title I of the ADA and the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the ADA, as such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections relate to employment, shall be the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied by section 504 agencies in investigating complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of employment discrimination. See section 506 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;569, 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section has been newly added to the final rule, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow maximum flexibility for the development of agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific memoranda of understanding (MOU) that would further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve to minimize duplication of effort and fully preserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an aggrieved individual's rights under both statutes. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a section 504 agency amends its regulations to make them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with title I of the ADA, the EEOC and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual section 504 agency may enter into an MOU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the investigation and processing by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agency of complaints or charges dual filed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both section 504 and title I of the ADA by the section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. Execution of an MOU would be discretionary on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of both the EEOC and the particular section 504 agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 agencies that amend their regulations to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them consistent with title I standards would have, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement with the EEOC, the option of acting as the EEOC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agent for investigating and processing under title I all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints covered by both title I and section 504 that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed with the section 504 agency. It is contemplated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terms of the MOU would be similar to the joint rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing section 107(b) as it pertains to section 503 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This final rule has been drafted in accordance with

Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation. The Department of Justice and the Equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employment Opportunity Commission have determined that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12875 prohibits executive departments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and agencies from promulgating any regulation that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a state, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local, or tribal government unless certain conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. Although the procedures for processing complaints or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges of employment discrimination established by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation may affect complaints or charges of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination filed against such entities, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not create any mandates affecting such entities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may, in fact, reduce any current burden by streamlining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints and charges at the Federal level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General and the Chairman of the EEOC have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed this regulation in accordance with the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), and by approving it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify that this regulation will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule does not establish reporting or record-keeping requirements that are considered to be information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements as that term is defined by the

unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The section 504 agency determines that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint under title I; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

its intention to make such a referral. The notice letter shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Inform the complainant that, unless the agency receives a written request from the complainant within twenty
days of the date of the notice letter requesting that the agency retain the complaint for investigation, the agency
will forward the complaint to the EEOC for investigation and processing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If the EEOC determines that it does not have jurisdiction under title I, and the section 504 agency determines that
it does not have jurisdiction under section 504 or title II, the complaint or charge shall be promptly referred to the
Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division shall determine if another Federal agency may have jurisdiction

When special circumstances make deferral as provided in this section inappropriate, the EEOC, and an agency with
investigative authority under section 504, may jointly determine to reallocate investigative responsibilities.
Special circumstances include, but are not limited to, cases in which the EEOC has already commenced its investigation
at the time that the agency discovers that the complaint or charge is a dual-filed complaint or charge in which the complainant
has elected section 504 processing, alleged discrimination in both employment and in other practices or services
of the respondent, or alleged a pattern or practice of employment discrimination.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule governs the circumstances under which attorneys employed by the Department of Justice (``Department'')
may communicate with persons known to be represented by counsel in the course of law enforcement investigations and
proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this rule is to impose a comprehensive, clear, and uniform set of regulations on the conduct of government
attorneys during criminal and civil investigations and enforcement proceedings. The rule is intended to ensure
that government attorneys adhere to the highest ethical standards, while eliminating the uncertainty and confusion
arising from the variety of interpretations of state rules, some of which have been incorporated as local court rules
in a number of federal district courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule establishes, prospectively, a general prohibition, subject to limited enumerated exceptions, against
contacts with ``represented parties'' without the consent of counsel. This prohibition derives from the American
Bar Association (``ABA'') Code of Professional Responsibility and its successor, the ABA Model Rules of Professional
Conduct. The rule, on the other hand, generally permits investigative contacts with ``represented persons'': that
is, individuals or organizations that are represented by counsel but that have not yet been named as defendants in
a civil or criminal enforcement proceeding or arrested as part of a criminal proceeding. However, the rule does not
permit contacts with represented persons without the consent of counsel for the purpose of negotiating plea agreements,
settlements, or other similar legal arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department intends to issue substantial additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual (``Manual'')
to provide additional direction to Department attorneys when they deal with represented individuals and organizations,
in order to accommodate more fully the principles and purposes underlying the state bar rules. Those provisions will
further restrict government attorneys when they contact targets of criminal or civil law enforcement investigations
who are known to be represented by counsel, and when they communicate with other represented persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule on the subject of communications with represented persons culminates a lengthy rulemaking process
in which a proposed rule on the same subject was issued three separate times for comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 10086 (Mar. 3, 1994); 58 FR 39976 (July 26, 1993); and 57 FR 54737 (Nov. 20, 1992). Comments received after the publication
in November 1992 and in July 1993 of earlier versions of the rule resulted in major substantive changes being made to
the rule. As a result, a new proposal reflecting these changes was published on March 3, 1994. During the most recent
comment period, the Department received many thoughtful comments from private attorneys, local bar organizations,
state courts, federal prosecutors, and others. The Department closely scrutinized all of these comments. After
considering those comments, the Depa
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rtment made several relatively minor amendments to the proposed rule. Therefore, the final rule remains in substantially
the same form as the proposed rule issued in March 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule reflects the Department's commitment to fostering ethical behavior consistent with the principles
informing DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility and Rule 4.2 of the Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, while setting forth clear and uniform national guidelines upon which government attorneys can rely in carrying
out their responsibilities to enforce federal laws. (The term ``attorney for the government'' is defined in paragraph
77.2(a), and where this phrase, or a variant of it, such as ``government attorney,'' is used elsewhere in this commentary,
it has the meaning set forth in paragraph 77.2(a), unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, and it is typically
used interchangeably with ``Department attorney.''). In essence, this regulation permits federal prosecutors
and agents to continue to conduct legitimate criminal and civil investigations against all individuals, whether
or not those persons are represented by counsel. It allows government attorneys to continue to make or direct undercover
or overt contacts with individuals and organizations represented by counsel for the purpose of developing factual
information up until the point at which they are arrested or charged with a crime or named as defendants in a civil law
enforcement action. However, the regulation generally does not permit federal prosecutors to attempt to negotiate
plea agreements, settlements, or similar arrangements with individuals represented by counsel without the consent
of their attorneys. This regulation also precludes, with certain narrow exceptions, any contacts with represented
parties after an arrest, indictment, or the filing of a complaint on the subject matter of the representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department plans to add provisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual that will set forth further
guidance. The Department intends to prohibit overt approaches by federal attorneys to represented targets of criminal
or civil enforcement proceedings without the consent of counsel, unless certain enumerated exceptions are met.
The planned provisions also will generally require that government attorneys receive approval from their supervisors
before communicating with any represented party or represented target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since early in this century, the rules of professional conduct that govern attorneys have required that lawyers for
one party in a dispute communicate only through an adverse party's lawyer, rather than directly. DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)
of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Disciplinary authorities in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia have adopted one of these rules, or a similar
prohibition. Underlying these rules is the recognition that when two parties in a legal proceeding are represented,
it is generally unfair for an attorney to circumvent opposing counsel and employ superior skills and legal training
to take advantage of the opposing party.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the courts have long recognized that government law enforcement agents must be allowed broad powers,
within constitutional limits, to investigate crime and civil violations of police and regulatory laws. These powers
properly include the authority to conduct undercover operations and to interview witnesses, potential suspects,
targets, and even those defendants who waive their right to remain silent. Although the Fifth and Sixth Amendments
significantly restrict contacts with defendants after their initial appearance before a judge or after indictment,
these constraints generally do not apply before a person has been taken into custody or charged in an adversary proceeding.
Sound policies support this substantial power of police to investigate. The general public, victims of crime, and
even potential suspects have a strong interest in vigorous inquiry by law enforcement officers before arrest or the
filing of charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as investigations were treated as within the province of the police alone, the traditional rule forbidding
counsel from directly contacting represented persons did not come into conflict with legitimate law enforcement
activities. In recent years, however, the Department of Justice has encouraged federal prosecutors to play a larger
role in preindictment, prearrest investigations. Some of this increased involvement stems from the wider use of
law enforcement techniques, such as electronic surveillance, which require the preparation of legal filings. Also,
complex white collar and organized crime investigations necessitate more intensive engagement of lawyers, who
present such cases to grand juries. Most important, greater participation of lawyers at the preindictment stage
of law enforcement has been regarded as helpful in assuring that police investigations comply with legal and ethical
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This extension of the traditional prosecutor's responsibility has been a salutary development. One by-product,
however, has been uncertainty about whether the traditional professional limitation on attorney contacts with
represented parties should be viewed as a restriction upon prosecutors engaged in investigations and, by extension,
the agents with whom they work. The overwhelming preponderance of federal appellate courts have held that the restriction
on contacts with represented persons does not apply at the preindictment investigation stage.

 at 839. By contrast, state courts and state bar organizations have varied widely in their interpretation of the scope
of the prohibition on contacts embodied in DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2, and their analogs. Some examples of the varying
interpretations are detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty about the scope and applicability of DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2, and their state counterparts has
directly affected the investigative activities of agents, including Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement
Administration personnel, who work with prosecutors. The expansive application of these rules in some jurisdictions
may have the effect of blocking preindictment interviews or undercover operations that most courts have held permissible
under federal constitutional and statutory law. Additionally, the heightened threat of disciplinary action that
accompanies the expansive application of these rules has created a chilling effect on prosecutors responsible for
directing these legitimate investigative activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These problems are compounded when federal attorneys assigned to the same case are members of different state bars.
Under federal law, a Department attorney must be a member in good standing of a state bar, but he or she need not belong
to the bar in each state in which he or she is practicing for the government. Therefore, prosecution teams often comprise
attorneys admitted to different bars. The application of different state disciplinary rules to these individuals
creates uncertainty, confusion, and the possibility of unfairness. Indeed, one member of a two-member federal prosecution
team could receive a commendation for effective law enforcement while the other member, licensed in a different state,
might be subject to state discipline for the same conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these circumstances, the Department has concluded that a compelling need exists that warrants a uniform
federal rule to reconcile the traditional rule against contacts with a represented party with the obligation of the
Department of Justice to enforce the law vigorously. Indeed, absent a uniform federal rule, prosecutors have been
moved on occasion to reduce their participation in the investigative phase of law enforcement so as to leave federal
agents unfettered by state disciplinary rules that were never intended to govern police behavior. Such a retreat
from the field by prosecutors serves neither efficiency nor the interest in elevating legal compliance and ethical
standards in all phases of law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the disciplinary rules themselves invite promulgation of a regulation such as this one. Nearly all
the states have adopted rules that include an ``authorized by law'' exception. This final rule, a duly promulgated
regulation, is intended to constitute ``law'' within the meaning of those exceptions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department has long maintained, and continues to maintain, that it has the authority to exempt its attorneys
from the application of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and their state counterparts. Furthermore, the Department
maintains that whether, and to what extent, such prohibitions should apply to Department attorneys is a policy question.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ethical Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op. O.L.C.
576, 577 (1980). In light of the fact that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of a prohibition
on contacts with represented parties, and in view of the long history of those rules, the Department believes that
its attorneys should adhere to the principles underlying those rules to the maximum extent possible, consistent
with the Department's law enforcement responsibilities. Therefore, even though the Department has the authority
to exempt its attorneys from the reach of these rules, the Department has decided not to implement a wholesale exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, this regulation attempts to reconcile the purposes underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 with effective
law enforcement. Recognizing the importance of the attorney-client relationship and the desirability that an individual
who is represented by counsel be fully advised by counsel before negotiating legal agreements, this regulation provides
that federal attorneys may not negotiate plea bargains, settlement agreements, immunity agreements, or similar
arrangements without the consent of the individual's attorney. There is a heightened risk in this context of the prosecutor's
superior legal training and specialized knowledge being used to the detriment of the untutored layperson. Thus,
the regulations comport with the principal purpose of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 by insisting that the individual's
attorney participate in these types of negotiations. Further, even when contacts are allowed, the regulation is
designed to minimize any intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. At the same time, this regulation does
permit direct contacts at the preindictment, prearrest investigative stage with any individual, whether or not
he or she is represented by counsel. The regulation is drafted to conform to the approach of most federal appellate
courts that have considered the matter. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., United States

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 498 U.S. 855 (1990), and other cases cited previously in connection with the discussion of preindictment contacts.
The Department believes that public policy and effective law enforcement would not be served if the simple act of retaining
an attorney could serve to exempt a person from lawful, court-approved investigative techniques. The Department
believes that it is inappropriate to alter investigative techniques based upon an individual's financial ability
to retain counsel before the point at which an indigent would be afforded court-appointed counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation and the planned changes to the United States Attorneys' Manual also will give effect to other important
aspects of the bar rules against contacts with represented parties. For example, the regulation precludes federal
attorneys from disparaging an individual's counsel or from attempting to gain access to attorney-client confidences
or lawful defense strategy. The guidelines that the Department intends to add to the Manual also will make clear that
once an individual is in a likely adversarial situation with the government and has retained an attorney to represent
himself or herself with respect to the particular subject matter under investigation, the government attorney must
take greater care before making any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts. While the regulation authorizes most communications before arrest, the planned Manual changes provide
that, as a matter of internal policy guidance, federal prosecutors generally should not make overt contacts with
represented targets of investigations. However, the planned Manual provisions permit overt contacts with a represented
target when initiated by the target; when necessary to prevent death or physical injury; when the relevant investigation
involves ongoing or additional crimes, or different crimes from that to which the representation relates; or when
a United States Attorney or an Assistant Attorney General expressly concludes, under all of the circumstances, that
the contact is needed for effective law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the regulation and planned Manual provisions also address when a government attorney may communicate with
an employee, officer, or director of a represented corporation or organization without the consent of counsel. The
regulation generally prohibits a government attorney from communicating with a current, high-level employee of
a represented organization who participates as a ``decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal
position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject matter'' once the organization has been named as a defendant
in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. Further, the contemplated Manual provisions would generally
prohibit contacts without the consent of counsel with controlling individuals of organizations that have not yet
been named as defendants but are targets of federal criminal or civil law enforcement investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule recognizes that state courts and disciplinary bodies generally play the primary role in regulating
the conduct of all attorneys, including those who work for the federal government. The Department also recognizes
that with respect to most matters, Department attorneys are subject to the bar rules and disciplinary proceedings
of the states in which they are licensed. However, the Department believes it must be the final arbiter of the scope
of policing with respect to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts involving federal prosecutors, subject to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. As noted above,
because of the expanded participation of federal prosecutors in preindictment investigations, and the trend of
state courts increasingly to apply DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 expansively against federal prosecutors, these
rules have affected and circumscribed the power of federal officials to carry out their legally mandated responsibilities.
This regulation provides that the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to determine these rules. Further,
the Department's rules are intended fully to preempt and supersede the application of state and local court rules
relating to contacts by Department of Justice attorneys when carrying out their federal law enforcement functions.
Only if the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney has willfully violated these new rules would that attorney
continue to be subject to the full measure of state disciplinary jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is confident that, taken together, this regulation, the planned Manual amendments, and this supplemental
information will promote the public interest in effective law enforcement in a manner that also conforms to the highest
standards of legal ethics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures established by this rule apply to conduct occurring after the rule's publication.

II. Rulemaking History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 22, 1992, the Department of Justice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proposed rule regarding communications with represented persons. 57 FR 54737. By December 21, 1992, the close of
the comment period, the Department had received comments from 20 sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was concerned that not all interested parties had received sufficient opportunity to respond during
the initial comment period. Noting ``the complex and important nature of the rule to the criminal and civil justice
systems and the licenses and livelihoods of its attorneys,'' on July 26, 1993, the Department reissued the proposed
rule for an additional 30-day comment period. 58 FR 39976. The Department received 219 comments following this second
publication of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 3, 1994, the Department issued a new proposed rule governing the same subject matter for an additional 30-day
comment period. 59 FR 10086. In response to concerns raised by bar organizations, bar counsel, state and federal judges,
and others, that proposal reflected substantial changes from the earlier proposals. This publication of the proposed
rule was accompanied by the issuance of companion provisions that the Department intends to include in the United
States Attorneys' Manual, which set forth certain more restrictive policies with regard to overt investigatory
communications. The discussion that follows summarizes the issues that were raised in response to the Department's
latest publication of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the most recent comment period, which closed on April 4, 1994, timely comments were received from 31 sources,
including nine individuals, nine organizations, four state court judges, one federal court judge, five U.S. Attorney's
Offices, two Department of Justice components, and one other federal agency. Of the 31 comments received, nine comments
supported promulgation of the proposed rule, 20 comments opposed the rule, and two other comments failed to take any
definitive position on the proposed rule as a whole. As with previous versions of this rule, many writing in opposition
to the Department's proposal argued that it unfairly permits the Department to hold its attorneys to ethical rules
different from those that apply to all other attorneys. Other opponents of the proposed rule_most notably the ABA
and a special committee of the Conference of State Supreme Court Chief Justices_challenged the proposed rule on constitutional
and statutory grounds, arguing that the Department lacks authority to preempt state ethics rules or to supersede
local federal district court rules. Those writing in support of the proposal generally praised it for bringing certainty
and clear guidance to an area that previously has been unclear and disruptive of law enforcement functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered carefully each comment and appreciates the thoughtfulness reflected in them. The
Department's responses to those comments are discussed below, either in the ``General Comments'' section or in the
context of the particular section or paragraph to which they pertain as part of the ``Section-by-Section'' analysis.
All revisions adopted in the final rule are indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received on the following three general issues: (1) the need for the rule; (2) the constitutional and
statutory authority for the rule; and (3) the sufficiency of the rule's internal enforcement mechanisms. These general
comments essentially repeated comments received in response to previous versions of the proposed rule. After careful
reconsideration of these recurring issues, the Department's position on many of these subjects_in particular,
the constitutional and statutory basis for this rule and the need for and advisability of such a rule_remains the same.
Therefore, the Department's response in this section builds upon responses published in previous commentaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Need for the Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One state court judge, one federal judge, five individuals, and six organizations criticized the proposed rule as
holding government attorneys to lower ethical standards than those that apply to all other attorneys. This comment
was formulated in a variety of ways, with the following as illustrative examples: ``[t]he rules apply to everyone,
and it should especially apply to attorneys in Government service;'' ``I do not know why it is that the department somehow
thinks [it] can exempt [its] attorneys from the rules of conduct that all of the lawyers must abide by;'' ``[Department]
lawyers should be treated as subject to the same rule of law that applies to the conduct of all other lawyers;'' and ``[f]airness
simply will not tolerate exalting the role of one adversary's advocate above the other.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Department finds it important, first, to make clear that this rule is not designed
to diminish the ethical responsibilities of government attorneys; it is intended to clarify those responsibilities.
The current situation, in which state contact rules purport to govern the substantive conduct of federal law enforcement
attorneys, has proven unsatisfactory because the standards of ethical conduct are uncertain and subject to unpredictable
and varying interpretations. This uncertainty as to what constitutes appropriate conduct by Department attorneys
has interfered with the responsible exercise of the law enforcement duties of Department attorneys. The basic purpose
of this regulation is to provide a uniform rule of ethics regarding contacts with represented persons that can be consistently
and predictably applied. By doing so, the regulation will allow all Department attorneys involved in a federal law
enforcement proceeding to understand and abide by applicable standards. There is simply no basis for believing that
there will be a reduction in compliance with ethical standards by federal prosecutors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters opposing the proposed rule dismissed as unnecessary the creation of a uniform set of rules for Department
attorneys. Some commented that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contact rules currently in place do not vary significantly, given that virtually every jurisdiction has adopted
some version of the ABA's anti-contact rule. Other commenters argued that, in any event, state and local ethics rules
do not interfere substantially with federal law enforcement activities because only in rare instances have federal
prosecutors actually been investigated by a state disciplinary authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an anti-contact rule is in effect in nearly all jurisdictions, it is not interpreted uniformly. Among other

 691 P.2d 564 (Wash. 1984). The lack of uniformity in interpreting existing anti-contact rules has created concern
among government attorneys of inadvertently running afoul of state court or federal district court rules. The threat
of disciplinary proceedings (and the possible resulting loss of license and livelihood) against a government attorney
engaged in legitimate law enforcement activities has had a chilling effect on the responsible exercise of law enforcement
duties. Many federal prosecutors who submitted comments in connection with the earlier versions of this rule stated
that they feel compelled to refrain from authorizing or participating in legitimate and ethical law enforcement
activities because of the current uncertainty as to the acceptability of various 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To add to the confusion inherent in the current situation, the Department's attorney staff consists of members of
many different state bars who commonly appear in multiple jurisdictions. Under the Model Rule's approach, an attorney
practicing in a jurisdiction in which he or she is not a member of the bar remains subject to the jurisdiction of the bar
of which he or she is a member, but if the rules in the two places differ, principles of conflict of laws may apply. Model
Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 8.5 and cmt. (1983). As a result, when state anti-contact rules purport to govern
the conduct of federal attorneys, the question of which rule governs the conduct of Department lawyers may often be
complicated. Indeed, as was noted in the ``Background'' section of this commentary, government attorneys may be
subject to substantially different rules when they are working alongside one another on the same case. One commenter
proposed that instead of issuing a uniform contacts rule for Department attorneys, the Department should encourage
its attorneys to practice only in a given jurisdiction and to obtain bar membership in that jurisdiction. However,
Congress has made clear that Department attorneys should be able to practice in different jurisdictions so long as
they are a member of some state bar, and there is a significant federal interest in preserving the Department's ability
to assign its attorneys wherever there are law enforcement needs to be met. This uniform rule regarding contacts with
represented persons achieves consistency and high ethical standards without hampering federal law enforcement
activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In formulating this uniform rule, the Department has not disregarded existing state ethics rules, as a number of comments
imply. As set forth in section 77.12, this regulation is specifically intended to fit within the structure of DR 7&hyph;104
and Model Rule 4.2, as well as analogous state and local district court disciplinary rules. Both DR 7&hyph;104 and
Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are exempted from the general prohibition
of the rule and, according to the Reporter for the commission that developed the Model Rules, Yale Law School ethics
professor Geoffrey Hazard, this exception was drafted with the ``government lawyer'' problem in mind.

 Letter of January 19, 1994 from Professor Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. to Chief Justice E. Norman Veasey, at 2 (``I can state
from first-hand knowledge that this [authorized by law] qualification was drafted mindful of the government lawyer
problem, among others. In my opinion it is within the authority of the federal government, particularly the Justice
Department, to promulgate such regulations.'') (This letter and all comments are on file with the Office of the Associate
Attorney General, United States Department of Justice). As explained later in this commentary, the Department's
position is that communications with represented persons undertaken pursuant to this duly promulgated regulation
clearly constitute communications ``authorized by law.'' Therefore, in nearly all jurisdictions, communications
approved under the Department's rules will be appropriate under existing ethical rules as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the content of this rule derives largely from DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and is wholly consistent
with the principles underlying these rules. This regulation grants greater latitude for lawyer communications
with a represented ``person'' during the investigative phase of law enforcement than with a represented ``party''
after adversarial proceedings have commenced. This distinction appears in the texts of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule
4.2, which prohibit only communications with ``a party'' the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the
matter. This distinction also accords with the great weight of federal court interpretations of the state ethics
rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The courts have readily recognized that Department attorneys engaged in criminal and civil law enforcement matters
perform distinctly different functions from attorneys engaged in the private practice of law. The courts have further
recognized that the rules governing communications with represented persons should take account of these differences.
To disregard these differences would therefore impose substantial and deleterious restrictions on the legitimate
law enforcement duties of Department attorneys that do not presently exist.

For much the same reasons, the Department believes that there is a basis for distinguishing for purposes of this regulation
between Department attorneys engaged in law enforcement activities (who are covered by this regulation) and Department
attorneys engaged in civil suits in which the United States is not acting under its police or regulatory powers (who
are not covered). One commenter proposed extending these rules to cover also the latter activities of Department
attorneys; however, because government attorneys engaged in other, ordinary civil litigation are not engaged in
distinctly different functions from private attorneys involved in civil cases, they are not brought under this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two organizations further criticized the Department for holding government attorneys to ethical standards no higher
than what the Constitution provides. The Department agrees that the constitutional baseline does not provide the
proper measure of government attorneys' ethical obligations. But this regulation does not purport to equate the
two standards. On the contrary, the Department's final rule imposes a range of restrictions that go beyond those that
are constitutionally compelled. For example, the regulation prohibits government attorneys generally from engaging
in negotiations of certain specified legal agreements with any represented individual without the consent of that
individual's counsel, even if that individual is not in custody and not formally charged. Such communications are
not constitutionally proscribed.

will place significant limits on the ability of government attorneys to engage in noncustodial communications with
a represented ``target'' of a federal criminal or civil law enforcement investigation, even though narrowing an
investigation to focus on a particular suspect does not trigger the suspect's right to counsel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual and a number of organizations, including the Conference of Chief Justices, posited that the Department
is acting outside the scope of its congressionally delegated authority because this regulation assertedly contravenes
the Department of Justice Appropriation Authorization Act of 1979, which requires all Department attorneys to be
``duly licensed and authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a State, territory, or the District of Columbia.''
Pub. Law No. 96&hyph;132, &sect;3(a), 93 Stat. 1040, 1044 (Nov. 30, 1979), as carried forward by Pub. Law No. 103&hyph;121,
107 Stat. 1153, 1163 (Oct. 27, 1993) (reenacting provisions of Pub. Law No. 96&hyph;132). These commenters suggested
that when Congress required Department attorneys to be licensed by a state bar, Congress implied that Department
attorneys should be subject to all the rules and regulations of state authorities, regardless of their impact on officials
carrying out federal law enforcement. Therefore, this regulation, by shielding Department attorneys from state
disciplinary proceedings for violations of state rules interfering with effective federal law enforcement, is
alleged to violate Congress's clear intent in enacting the Department's appropriation statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department believes that these comments mistake the purpose and effect of the congressional requirement that
federal attorneys have state licenses. That requirement, which is satisfied by admission to the state's bar and maintenance
of bar membership, simply serves to ensure that the professional qualifications of all Department lawyers have in
fact been examined. No comment received by the Department demonstrates that Congress intended the requirement to
have the further effect of interfering with the Attorney General's ability to ensure effective federal law enforcement
or of compelling federal attorneys to comply with state bar ethical standards that contradict federal rules.

The Department's Power to Preempt State Ethics Rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One individual, one state court judge, and five organizations, including the Special Committee of the Conference
of Chief Justices, commented that the Department does not have the constitutional power to preempt state regulation
of its attorneys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should first be noted that in most instances the force and effect of these rules should not depend on whether they
preempt state ethics rules under the Supremacy Clause. As already noted, communications within the scope of the regulation
are intended to constitute communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of DR 7&hyph;104, Model
Rule 4.2, and analogous disciplinary rules. Therefore, if the relevant state rule contains an authorized-by-law
exception, this regulation should be seen as constituting such authorization, thereby bringing any attorney communication
permissible under these rules in conformity with that state law and eliminating the Supremacy Clause issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee of Chief Justices commented that it is the exclusive province of the state supreme courts to construe
state disciplinary rules and to determine whether this regulation falls within the ``authorized by law'' exception
to these rules. The Department has simply expressed its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
intention
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to fit communications made pursuant to these rules within the ``authorized by law'' exception to state and local federal
court rules, and its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
belief
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this regulation indeed constitutes legal authorization for such communications. The Department notes that
it would seem to require a very strained reading to conclude that a regulation duly promulgated after notice and comment
and within the scope of its delegated authority does not also constitute ``law.''

intent before the phrase `authorized by law' in [18 U.S.C.] &sect;1905 could be held to have a narrower ambit than the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department recognizes that situations may arise in which the power of this regulation to displace state
rules will depend on its preemptive force under the Supremacy Clause. Such situations may arise in several forms:
where the applicable ethics rule has no ``authorized by law'' exception; where this regulation is deemed not to constitute
``law'' for purposes of such exception; or where a communication is held to violate the applicable ethics rule and
not be ``authorized'' by this regulation. Therefore, an important feature of this regulation is its express intention
to preempt and supersede the operation of state and local federal court rules as they relate to contacts by Department
attorneys, regardless of whether such rules are inconsistent or consistent with this regulation, absent a finding
of a willful violation of these rules by the Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preemption of state regulation of contacts with represented persons, except when the Attorney General has found
a willful violation of the federal regulation, was an integral feature of this rule as proposed earlier. The proposed
rule reflected the Department's belief that preemption of state and local rules, which have been unevenly applied,
is necessary to ensure that government attorneys' conduct respecting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts is subject to uniform and predictable standards. The Department has made minor revisions to section 77.12
to clarify that the Department's intent is to displace even purportedly consistent state regulation in this area
(or, as it is commonly phrased, to ``occupy the field'' of reviewing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts by Department attorneys). The rules and this commentary now state in more express terms the Department's
intention to preclude any state regulation of government attorneys respecting the subject matter of these rules,
unless the Attorney General first finds a willful violation of these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments suggested that the Attorney General lacks the authority to preempt state disciplinary rules, absent
an explicit Congressional authorization to do so. These comments misconceive the power of a federal agency or department
to preempt state regulation. Congress may, of course, expressly preempt all state regulation in a particular field,

In promulgating this regulation, the Department is acting within the scope of its discretionary authority. The ample
consideration given to this regulation and its earlier versions reflects the Department's effort reasonably to
accommodate the relevant policies concerning law enforcement and professional conduct, and, as discussed in the
previous section, there is no basis for concluding that the Department has exceeded its statutory authority. Moreover,
the purpose of these rules, as defined in section 77.1, is to ``ensure the Department's ability to enforce federal
law effectively and ethically'' and so fulfill the Department's statutory responsibilities.

 355 U.S. 570, 575 (1958). One individual and two organizations commented that this regulation, if promulgated, would
abrogate the primary authority of federal courts to regulate the conduct of attorneys arising out of federal law enforcement
proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department views this concern as significant but essentially theoretical, because the regulation has been crafted
so that it will not operate in a way that puts it into conflict with local district court rules. However, in response
to these comments, it should be noted that through this regulation the Department does intend not only to preempt the
application by state courts of state rules relating to contacts by attorneys for the government, but also to supersede
the application by federal courts of the local federal district court rules relating to contacts by government attorneys
in civil and criminal law enforcement investigations and proceedings.

 &sect;77.12 and accompanying commentary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two reasons why the promulgation and operation of this regulation is unlikely to present the issue of abrogation
of federal court authority identified by these commenters. The first is that the regulation adopts the line of analysis
adopted by the great weight of authority interpreting local district court rules governing contacts with represented
persons.

, 498 U.S. 855 (1990). The Department has not sought in this regulation to validate conduct that would otherwise be
invalid under most local district court rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, nearly all district courts that have adopted local rules governing contacts with represented persons
have incorporated the ``authorized by law'' exception in the Model Rules or in the corresponding state rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See generally Rand,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 926 F.2d at 601&hyph;603. As explained above, this regulation constitutes ``law'' within the meaning of any such
exception. Thus, the conduct this regulation authorizes is for that reason equally authorized by these local district
court rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, this regulation in practice should not present any tension between the federal executive and judicial powers.
In response to the commenters' suggestion that any tension would have to be resolved in favor of the judicial power,
however, the Department disagrees. Were the issue to arise, it would be properly considered, as an initial matter,
as a question of the proper exercise of delegated legislative authority. Congress, not the courts, has the primary
power to prescribe rules for the federal courts.

975 F.2d 102, 107 (3d Cir. 1992) (Rules of Criminal Procedure). A local rule inconsistent with a regulation lawfully
issued under statutory authority is, as a matter of law, inconsistent with the underlying statute, and must yield
to Congress's paramount authority as delegated to the department or agency issuing the regulation. Thus, the conclusion
that the Attorney General has the statutory authority to promulgate the proposed regulation entails the further
conclusion that the regulation displaces inconsistent local federal court rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the regulation has been carefully drawn in such a way so that once a person has been brought before a court,
in general no substantive communication can occur without the consent of counsel unless: the court finds a knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary waiver; the communication is made pursuant to court-approved discovery procedures;
or the communication concerns a criminal or civil offense different from the offense before the court. The regulation
thus accords substantial and appropriate deference to the court's supervisory authority over the parties and proceedings
before it. Moreover, this regulation does not purport to disturb the authority of federal courts to fashion appropriate
remedies when an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

a district court to assert supervisory authority to regulate and sanction the conduct of executive branch attorneys

that judgment has been embodied in a duly promulgated regulation, and when the conduct concerns persons who have not
yet come before the court.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sufficiency of Internal Enforcement Mechanisms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four organizations and two individuals commented that these rules, as proposed, lacked enforcement mechanisms
sufficient to deter prohibited communications. These comments took two forms: (1) a general suggestion that the
Department could not be trusted to police itself (or as, one commenter put it, it would be a case of ``the fox maintain[ing]
.&blank;.&blank;. guard over the hen-house''); and (2) a specific concern that the restrictions to be placed in the
United States Attorneys' Manual would not in fact be enforced against Department attorneys who violated them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General has exclusive authority over any violations of these rules. As a general matter, violations
of these rules will be addressed as matters of attorney discipline by the Department, rather than by any external disciplinary
authority. Only if the Attorney General finds a willful violation of these rules may sanctions for the violations
be imposed by a state disciplinary authority. This disciplinary structure reflects the Department's belief that
allowing sanctions to be issued independent of the Department's internal review process would frustrate the Department's
efforts to eliminate the current uncertainty arising from the differing interpretations of the various anti-contact
rules by federal courts, state courts, and state disciplinary authorities. The Department intends fully to enforce
these rules and to issue appropriate and strong sanctions for any violation of these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also disagrees with those comments that suggest that the provisions the Department currently intends
to add to the United States Attorneys' Manual will not be enforced. The Manual contains a great number of significant
Department of Justice policies, many of which impose substantial restrictions on Department attorneys. There is
no evidence that such policies are routinely overlooked by Department attorneys or that violations of policies set
forth in the Manual are not regarded by the Department as serious breaches of professional duties. On the contrary,
the failure to follow such policies is taken very seriously. The Department expects its attorneys involved in criminal
or civil law enforcement to follow all provisions in the Manual amendments that it intends to issue regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts. Failure to follow such rules will result in appropriate discipline by the Department.

Section 77.2: Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms are defined in section 77.2 of this part. In the final rule, unlike in the proposed rule, these terms
are arranged alphabetically for the reader's ease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Attorney for the government.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``attorney for the government'' includes virtually all Department of Justice attorneys with investigative,
litigative, or management responsibilities, regardless of title. It does not, however, include law enforcement
agents employed by the Department of Justice who are also members of state bars, if they are employed as, and are performing
the function of, agents rather than attorneys. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency and
other investigative agencies have long recruited individuals with advanced degrees_including, for example, engineering,
business, and law degrees_to serve as agents. The Department strongly encourages the recruitment of educated and
specially-trained individuals for positions as agents. An agent's bar membership should not adversely affect his
or her ability to conduct comprehensive investigations and otherwise to fulfill his or her law enforcement functions.
Therefore, the rule specifically exempts attorney-agents from its scope if they are employed by the government as
investigative agents and not as attorneys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term also does not include attorneys for departments or agencies outside the Department of Justice, regardless
of their litigative authority, except to the extent such persons have been specially appointed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
515 or 543.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two Department of Justice components commented that the definition of ``attorney for the government,'' which explicitly
covers attorneys employed in the six main divisions of the Department, should be amended to cover all attorneys working
in the legal offices of the various Department agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The Department agrees that the definition of ``attorney for the government'' should not
distinguish between attorneys employed in the Department's divisions and attorneys employed in the Department's
agencies, given that both sets of attorneys exercise similar functions and responsibilities with respect to criminal
investigations and prosecutions. Accordingly, the definition of ``attorney for the government'' has been modified
to include explicitly ``the Chief Counsel of the DEA and any attorney employed in that office, the General Counsel
of the FBI and any attorney employed in that office or in the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI, and, in addition, any
attorney employed in, or head of, any other legal office in a Department of Justice agency.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Civil Law Enforcement Investigation.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This term includes any investigation of potential civil violations of, or claims under, federal law that may form
the basis of a civil law enforcement proceeding, as defined in paragraph 77.2(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Civil Law Enforcement Proceeding.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``civil law enforcement proceeding'' encompasses a variety of activities beyond the particular areas identified
in the definition, which are intended only to be illustrative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion of proceedings related to the enforcement of an administrative subpoena or summons or a civil investigative
demand (CID) is intended to ensure that the filing of such a proceeding does not trigger the limitations of section
77.5, which generally prohibits 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications once adversary proceedings have commenced against a represented ``party.'' Thus, the filing by
the United States of a proceeding to enforce a subpoena, summons, or CID will not prohibit further investigatory communications
regarding the underlying substantive violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final sentence of paragraph 77.2(c)(2) ensures that the United States need not be the plaintiff in order for a civil
action to be ``brought by the United States,'' but may be a counterclaimant or cross-claimant if the counterclaim
or cross-claim otherwise fits within the description of civil law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cooperating witness or individual.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``cooperating witness or individual'' is defined to include informants, witnesses, and other persons who are not
law enforcement agents, but only to the extent that such a person is acting ``to assist the government in an undercover
or confidential capacity.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

in which the identity of a government employee, or the fact that an individual is cooperating with the government,

Section 77.3: Represented Party; Represented Person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section differentiates between a represented ``party'' and a represented ``person.'' This distinction is
fully consistent with the language of and principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104(a)(1) and Model Rule 4.2, which establish
general prohibitions against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with a represented ``party.'' Section 77.5 of this part generally prohibits government attorneys from
initiating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented parties, but does not prohibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented persons. (However, sections 77.8 and 77.9 also prohibit certain contacts with represented
persons). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual is considered to be a ``represented party'' under paragraph 77.3(a) if: (1) the person is represented
by counsel; (2) the representation is current 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concerns the subject matter in question; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) the person has either been arrested or charged in a federal criminal case or is a defendant in a civil law enforcement
proceeding concerning the subject matter of the representation. If the person is currently represented in fact regarding
the subject matter in question, but has not been charged or arrested, that person is considered a ``represented person.''
Thus, witnesses, suspects, and targets of investigations who have not been indicted or arrested, but are represented
regarding the subject matter in question, are considered represented persons under this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters argued that this section's basic distinction between represented ``persons'' and represented
``parties'' runs counter to the policy considerations underlying DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2. However,
as discussed in the ``General Comments'' section, this distinction is consistent with the vast majority of federal
court opinions interpreting DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2., as well as the text of those rules. Furthermore,
this distinction is grounded in logic and common sense, given the legitimate necessity for attorneys for the government
to be able to direct agents and cooperating witnesses to contact represented persons during undercover investigations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One organization commented that prosecutors will hold back on filing formal charges in order to maximize their ability
to communicate with represented ``persons.'' The Department does not agree that prosecutors are likely to engage
in this kind of systematic manipulation. The capacity to do so exists under the Sixth Amendment (given that the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel attaches only once formal charges are filed,

, 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1979)), but there is no evidence of systematic prosecutorial abuse of the charging process under
the Sixth Amendment. Furthermore, the Department intends to add a new provision to the United States Attorneys' Manual
that will prohibit a Department attorney from communicating overtly with a ``target'' of an investigation before
he or she is formally charged or named as a civil defendant, except in specifically enumerated circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section makes clear that this regulation does not purport to authorize any communication prohibited by the Constitution
or any federal statute or Federal Rule of Criminal or Civil Procedure. Although these rules do not supersede the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this limitation does not extend to other rules
regarding procedure in federal courts. Thus, rules of procedure adopted by individual courts as local rules, many
of which incorporate state bar rules, are not included in this limitation; and, in fact, this regulation is explicitly
intended to supersede local federal court rules regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts by attorneys for the government.

Section 77.5: General Rule for Civil and Criminal Enforcement; Represented Parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section closely tracks the language of DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2 and applies similar prohibitions
to attorneys for the government. The section prohibits an attorney for the government from communicating with a represented
party, as defined in section 77.3, about the subject matter of the representation without the consent of that individual's
attorney. As with DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2, the prohibition applies only if the attorney for the government
knows that the represented party is, in fact, represented by counsel. Therefore, communications by an attorney for
the government with a represented party will not violate this rule if the attorney for the government is unaware of
the fact of representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also prohibits an attorney for the government from causing another individual to communicate with a
represented party. Accordingly, this rule proscribes an attorney from directing a government investigator to do
what the attorney himself or herself is prohibited from doing. Conversely, a government attorney will not be personally
responsible for the actions of agents in communicating with represented persons unless, in doing so, the agents were
acting as the attorney's ``alter ego.''

It also should be noted that this provision is violated (and thus, a basis for departmental discipline exists) when

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the circumstances under which Department attorneys may communicate, or cause others to communicate,
with a represented party whom the Department attorney knows is represented concerning the subject matter of the representation,
without first obtaining the consent of the represented party's counsel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This exception recognizes the fact that there is no reason to prohibit a limited inquiry about whether an individual
is, in fact, represented by counsel regarding the relevant subject matter. Such an inquiry does not involve the kind
of communication about which courts have expressed concern and has little potential for undermining the attorney-client
relationship. It is also consistent with DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be uncertainty about the existence of representation with respect to whether it has been established, whether
it may have been terminated, and whether a particular subject falls within the scope of the representation. The first
issue typically arises before a judicial or other appearance, when the government attorney has some information
suggesting that the person may be represented. It also may arise when an attorney purports to represent a group of persons,
such as all the employees of a corporation. Uncertainty about the termination of the representation may arise when
substantial time has passed since it was made known that the person was represented by counsel or when the attorney
for the government has reason to believe that the representation has ceased. It is unlikely, however, that such uncertainty
will arise when there are pending judicial proceedings, because in such circumstances the court in most jurisdictions
must approve termination of representation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to one comment, it is worth clarifying that that representation is presumed to cease to be current for purposes
of these rules when the matter in question has reached a final judgment (i.e., once the direct appeals process, including
any petition for certiorari, has run its full course), unless there is reason to believe that representation is continuing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When inquiring about the status of representation, government attorneys and agents generally must refrain from
stating whether it is necessary or desirable to be represented by counsel. After the right to counsel has attached,
a statement or implication suggesting that counsel is not providing proper or effective representation could violate
the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.

One organization commented that the right to inquire whether a party is represented by counsel is an invitation to
a more substantive conversation with a represented party with respect to the matter underlying the representation,
which would violate these rules. The Department does not agree that this paragraph creates a significant potential
for abuse. This exception, which is clear in its terms, allows Department attorneys to do no more than determine whether
a person is in fact represented by counsel. The Department expects that all Department attorneys will understand
the limited parameters and purpose of this exception, and any attempt to use this paragraph to gather additional information
about the subject matter of the representation would be a clear violation of these rules and would constitute sanctionable
conduct.

with process has an opportunity to consult with counsel prior to his or her appearance at the proceeding, and may have
counsel present if desired during the proceeding (except, of course, while testifying before a grand jury). More
generally, communications authorized by discovery procedures already have in place appropriate mechanisms for
protection of the attorney-client relationship. This provision ensures that this regulation does not prevent such
communications from continuing to be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This exception does not purport to authorize any communications not otherwise available pursuant to approved discovery
procedures or legal process. However, one individual commented that the text of paragraph (b), as proposed in March

in the absence of the party's attorney and without the attorney's prior agreement_even where such practice was not
in accordance with the rules of the applicable tribunal. To clarify that this paragraph's intent is to authorize only
approved discovery procedures or legal process, this paragraph has been amended in the final rule to exempt only those
communications made pursuant to discovery procedures or legal process ``in accordance with the orders or rules of
the court or other tribunal where the matter is pending.''

Initiation of communication by represented party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph sets out the circumstances under which it is proper for a government attorney to communicate with a
represented party who has initiated contact, without the consent of that party's counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A defendant may wish to communicate with the government outside the presence of counsel for many valid reasons. For
instance, a defendant may wish to cooperate with the government but not want his or her attorney to know for fear that
the attorney will disclose the defendant's intentions to others. This situation may arise, for example, when the
defendant's attorney is being paid by another individual involved in a criminal enterprise, and the defendant questions
whether he or she has the attorney's undivided loyalty. The same problem may arise when a single attorney represents
multiple parties who are part of the same criminal enterprise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the desire of a defendant or arrestee to speak with the attorney for the government outside the presence of his
or her counsel is ``voluntary, knowing, and informed,'' there is no valid reason to prohibit the government from engaging
in such communications. In fact, the Department believes that it would be a dereliction of its obligation vigorously
to enforce federal law if it promulgated a rule that would prohibit such communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that an individual who is entitled to counsel under the Fifth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment
may waive that right and choose to communicate with the government outside the presence of his or her attorney, ``provided
the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.'' Moran

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph includes procedural protections designed to ensure that such waivers are in fact voluntary, knowing,
and informed. After a represented individual has been arrested or charged in a criminal proceeding or is named as a
defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding, this paragraph requires that several steps be taken before a government
attorney may engage in a substantive discussion with the represented party. First, the government attorney must
inform the individual of his or her right to speak through his or her attorney and to have that attorney present for any
communications with the government attorney. Second, the represented party must manifest his or her desire to waive
the right to counsel in a voluntary, knowing, and informed way. If at all possible, the attorney for the government
should obtain a signed written waiver. Third, the attorney for the government must bring the matter before the appropriate
district court judge, magistrate judge, or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. Then, it is up to the court to
determine that the waiver satisfies the provisions of this rule or that substitute counsel is in place (including
counsel appointed at that time by the court) who has consented to the communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph does not require, however, that the waiver must always take place before the judge or magistrate judge.
In exceptional circumstances, it may be impractical or unsafe to bring the defendant before a judge or magistrate
judge to secure the waiver. In such circumstances, the government attorney may secure a waiver from the defendant
outside the court, and, before any substantive discussion between the defendant and the government takes place,
bring evidence of the waiver to the court so that the court can determine whether the waiver was made knowingly, intelligently,
and voluntarily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One United States Attorney's Office commented that paragraph (c), as proposed, appeared to require an attorney first
to obtain an informed waiver and only after receiving such a waiver to bring the matter before the appropriate tribunal.
The Department does not intend to require (and does not understand the text of paragraph (c) to require) an attorney
for the government, when contacted by a represented party, necessarily to attempt to secure a waiver himself or herself
before bringing the matter to the attention of the court. A government attorney who is contacted by a represented party
may, consistent with this paragraph, choose to bring the matter directly to the attention of the court, assuming the
represented party has manifested his or her desire to waive the right to counsel. The court then would determine whether
the party wishes to waive the presence of counsel for the communication. In general, however, the usual practice is
for the government attorney to obtain from the represented party a waiver before bringing the matter before the court.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the initiation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts by represented parties frequently occurs in the context of the ``fearful defendant'' whose attorney has
been chosen by a third party, often an individual above the defendant in the criminal hierarchy. Such a defendant may
wish to cooperate with the government but may fear that his life or safety will be endangered if his attorney learns
of the cooperation. Although the need for a mechanism by which a represented party can initiate contacts with the government
is particularly acute in this context, paragraph (c) is not limited to this setting. Rather, the proper inquiry is
whether the represented party's waiver of the right to counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed, not whether the
represented party has established some overriding justification for his or her decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One organization objected to the extension of this exception to anyone other than a ``fearful defendant,'' suggesting
that any other client will have no better reason to initiate communication than ``a misguided belief that he can help
himself by talking to the prosecutor.'' The Department believes that it would be overly paternalistic to refuse to
permit any but fearful represented parties to initiate direct contact with the government. Given that a criminal
defendant has a constitutional right to decline legal representation entirely, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

California
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), government attorneys should not be ethically bound to refuse to listen to a criminal defendant
who chooses to decline the presence of counsel for purposes of a particular communication with appropriate court
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it would be neither workable nor proper to require a Department attorney or judicial officer to probe
the client about his or her relationship with counsel in order to ascertain whether the client is genuinely fearful,
or fearful enough, of his or her attorney's involvement to justify a conversation outside the presence of counsel.
Such an inquiry would tend to enhance, not minimize, intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. A more reliable
protection of the client's interest and of the attorney-client relationship is this paragraph's careful process
of testing the client's desire (as opposed to the client's reasons) for waiving the presence of counsel. This is the
same analysis the courts undertake in assessing waivers of the constitutional rights to counsel or against self-incrimination.
The proper issue in such a setting, as here, is whether the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paragraph (d): Waivers at the time of arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous paragraph (paragraph (c)) provides the general guidelines regarding how a represented party may waive
protections otherwise provided under this regulation. This paragraph provides for a different rule dealing specifically
with a waiver at the time of arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that a government attorney may communicate directly with a represented party ``at the time
of arrest of the represented party'' without the consent of that party's counsel, provided that the represented party
has been fully informed of his or her constitutional rights at that time and has waived them. The government attorney
need not comply with any of the additional requirements of paragraph (c) in such a situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A substantial body of law has developed regarding waiver of constitutional rights in the immediate post-arrest setting.
The Department believes that the constitutional protections established in that decisional law adequately protect
represented individuals following arrest. Furthermore, the effectiveness of post-arrest interviews would be
significantly curtailed if the procedural requirements of paragraph (c) applied. Accordingly, this paragraph
is intended to preserve this investigative tool without adding any additional procedural requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received two comments regarding this paragraph: one relating to the timing of the waiver, and the other
relating to the terms of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Department component commented that it would clarify the meaning of a communication ``at the time of the arrest of
the represented person'' to add to the text that such communication must be made ``at the time of the arrest of the represented
party before he or she is presented to a judicial officer with respect to that arrest . . . .'' The Department has decided
against adopting the proposed additional language, because it would unadvisedly extend this exception beyond its
proper and intended narrow limits. This exception to the general rule against post-arrest communications is designed
to preserve the ability of government attorneys to interview individuals immediately (i.e., within hours) following
arrest as an effective and important law enforcement tool. See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 18 U.S.C. 3501(c). It is not intended to allow government attorneys to attempt to initiate communications with an
arrested person any time before the person is presented to a judicial officer, which can extend days beyond the ``time
of arrest.'' The Department believes that such an extension of this limited exception could put excessive pressure
on clients and unduly intrude upon the attorney-client relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A United States Attorney's Office commented that proposed paragraph (d), under which the represented party must
be advised of and waive ``his or her constitutional rights,'' could be construed to require the represented party
to be explicitly told that he or she has a right to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts with a represented party if the contacts involve the investigation of offenses as to which the represented
party has been neither arrested nor charged in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Department believes
this approach is wholly consistent with DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and the cases interpreting those rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this section provides that communications may be made in the course of investigations of additional,
different, or ongoing criminal or unlawful activity, even though the individual is represented by counsel with respect
to conduct for which he or she has already been arrested or charged. Such additional criminal or unlawful conduct is
typically one of three varieties: (1) conduct that is separate from the original wrongful conduct; (2) crimes or unlawful
conduct that are intended to impede the administration of justice or the trial of the charged crime, such as subornation
of perjury, obstruction of justice, jury tampering, or murder, assault, or intimidation of witnesses; and (3) conduct
that is a continuation of the charged crime, such as a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud that continues past the time
of indictment. The new or additional criminal or wrongful activity may have occurred in the past or may be ongoing at
the time of the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One organization objected to this section's coverage of criminal or wrongful activity that has already been completed
at the time of the communication, as distinct from activity that is ongoing. However, the Department sees no basis
in the policies underlying the Sixth Amendment and the Model Rules for basing the propriety of investigation into
additional or different uncharged crimes on whether such activity is complete or ongoing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One individual expressed concern that Department attorneys would exploit this exception by making gratuitous allusions
to other offenses in the course of an otherwise illicit contact with a represented party. As noted above, prevailing
case law interpreting the Sixth Amendment and the Model Rules permit an attorney to question a defendant as to uncharged
offenses, and there is no evidence of systemic prosecutorial abuse of this type of interrogation. Accordingly, there
is no reason to suspect that prosecutorial practice under these rules will be different.

] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). This paragraph
recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties
in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances
and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception has three requirements: (1) the attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety
or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against
the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication
is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception
is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example,
the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under
ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must
be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However,
information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with constitutional limitations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts therefore does not apply. This section makes clear that attorneys for the government are authorized to communicate,
directly or indirectly, with a represented person unless the contact is prohibited by some other provision of federal
law. These communications are subject, however, to the restrictions set forth in sections 77.8 and 77.9 regarding
certain categories of negotiations and respect for attorney-client relationships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two individuals commented that this section, even as limited by sections 77.8 and 77.9, allows a broader range of contact
with persons under investigation than is necessary to meet the Department's legitimate investigative needs. These
individuals agreed that the government must be free to conduct undercover operations and investigations, even when
field investigators coming into contact with potential criminal or civil respondents are directed by government
attorneys. They argued, however, that overt communications with persons during the investigative stage are not
similarly justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that overt communications between a government attorney and a represented person during the
investigative stage raise different considerations from covert communications and should be subject to greater
restrictions. For this reason, the Department plans to make revisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual providing
that government attorneys should engage in overt communications only after carefully considering whether the communication
is more appropriately handled by others, and should generally not communicate overtly, or cause another to communicate
overtly, with a target of a federal criminal or civil investigation, who is known by the Department attorney to be represented
by counsel, concerning the subject matter of the representation. Nevertheless, the Department believes that overt
contacts by federal attorneys and agents with witnesses and subjects of investigations are often necessary for effective
law enforcement and hence should be permitted.

person, it ordinarily would be improper for a government attorney to initiate or negotiate a plea agreement, settlement,
immunity agreement or any other disposition of a claim or charge without the consent of the individual's counsel.
The one exception to this prohibition occurs when the communication is initiated by the represented person or represented
party and the procedural safeguards provided for in paragraph 77.6(c) are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section is important for the preservation of the attorney-client relationship.
One of the primary purposes of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 is to protect an individual represented by counsel from
overreaching by an attorney for an adversary. The Department believes the risk and the consequences of such overreaching
are at their greatest during negotiations over plea agreements, settlements, and other key legal agreements. The
training, experience, and knowledge of the law possessed by an attorney is particularly valuable in such situations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prohibition contained in this section includes all negotiations of the terms of a particular plea agreement,
settlement agreement, or other agreement covered by the section. However, this section does not prohibit an attorney
for the government from responding to questions regarding the nature of such agreements, potential charges, potential
penalties, or other subjects related to such agreements during an otherwise permissible discussion. Nevertheless,
an attorney for the government should take care in such situations not to go beyond providing information on these
and similar subjects and should generally refer the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion
of these issues. The government attorney should also make it clear that he or she will not negotiate any agreement with
respect to the disposition of criminal charges, civil claims or potential charges, or immunity agreements without
the consent of counsel.

Paragraph (a): Deference to Attorney-Client Relationship
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal courts have recognized that it is improper for an attorney for the government to disparage counsel for the
represented party or otherwise to seek to disrupt the relationship between that party and his attorney.

. at 740&hyph;41 (Godbold, J., specially concurring). This paragraph codifies those basic principles by prohibiting
communications that: (1) attempt to elicit information regarding lawful defense strategies; (2) disparage the
represented party's counsel; or (3) otherwise improperly seek to disrupt the attorney-client relationship. These
prohibitions apply in every phase of criminal and civil enforcement investigations and proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the paragraph also accommodates an important exception to this prohibition. Courts have held that a government
attorney may not permit legal proceedings to go forward if he or she is aware of a conflict of interest between a represented
party and his or her lawyer.

, 786 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1986). Under this circumstance, the attorney for the government ordinarily should move to
disqualify the lawyer involved, if legal proceedings have already commenced. If it is not feasible to move for disqualification
or otherwise challenge the representation, this paragraph allows an attorney for the government to communicate
with the represented individual for the limited purpose of apprising the represented individual of the perceived
conflict. However, any substantive discussion of the subject matter of the representation is permissible only insofar
as it is authorized by some other provision of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that this provision is used only in rare circumstances, the rule requires prior authorization for
such communications from the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, an
Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney. The authorization should be in writing if at all possible.
Furthermore, before providing approval, the authorizing officer must find: (1) a substantial likelihood of a conflict;
and (2) that it is not feasible to obtain a court order on the matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One organization commented that judicial approval, or at least approval by a designated Assistant Attorney General
(rather than by a United States Attorney), should be required before an attorney for the government may apprise a represented
party or person of any perceived conflict of interest. Another organization and an individual commented that attorneys
for the government should never be allowed to inform a represented individual of a perceived conflict of interest,
and, instead, should be required to move to disqualify counsel and leave it to the court to adjudicate any conflicts
of interest. The Department believes that there will be circumstances in which it will not be feasible to obtain a judicial
order challenging the representation (especially prior to the filing of charges), or when the exigencies of the situation
may make it impracticable to obtain prior authorization of a judicial officer or an Assistant Attorney General. In
such circumstances, and when a high-level Department official, such as a United States Attorney, determines that
there is a significant likelihood of a conflict of interest between a represented individual and his or her attorney,
it is better that the represented person or party be apprised of the potential conflict of interest than be left uninformed.
Accordingly, the Department has decided to leave this paragraph unchanged in the final rule.

Paragraph (b): Attorney-Client Meetings

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attendance of an undercover agent or a cooperating witness at lawful meetings of an individual and his or her attorneys
is ordinarily an improper intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. The courts have recognized, however,
that such attendance occasionally will be required when the operative is invited to participate and his or her refusal
to do so would effectively reveal his or her connection to the government.

Attendance at such meetings, however, intrudes into the attorney-client relationship and impairs the right of the
defendant to a fair trial. Accordingly, this section provides that undercover agents or cooperating witnesses may
participate in such meetings, but only when requested to do so by the defense and when reasonably necessary to protect
their safety or life or the confidentiality of an undercover operation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When there is reasonable cause to believe that the purpose of the meeting is not the lawful defense of the underlying
charges, but the commission of a new or additional crime (such as bribery of a witness or subordination of perjury),
attendance by informants or undercover agents at attorney-client meetings is permissible pursuant to paragraph
77.6(e). The belief, however, must be based on reasonable cause, not mere suspicion or conjecture. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Mastroianni,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 749 F.2d at 906. Furthermore, the prohibition against communication of lawful defense strategy to the prosecution
should be observed if, in fact, such strategy is imparted to the informant or agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government attorneys should give serious consideration to the extreme sensitivity of permitting agent and informant
attendance at defense meetings. Agents and informants should be instructed to avoid participating in such meetings,
and to minimize their participation when attendance is required, if it is possible to do so without arousing suspicion.
Agents or witnesses who attend defense meetings should also be instructed to make every attempt to avoid taking any
role in the shaping of defense strategy or trial preparations. Additionally, agents and informants should be instructed
to avoid imparting lawful defense strategy or trial preparation information to attorneys for the government or to
law enforcement agents who are directly participating in the ongoing investigation or in the prosecution of pending
criminal charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this restriction applies only to law enforcement officials and cooperating witnesses who are acting as
``agents for the government'' at the time of the communication. If one of several co-defendants who attended an attorney-client
defense strategy meeting later testifies for the government at trial, no violation will have occurred as long as the
co-defendant was not a government agent at the time of the meeting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Department component commented that an undercover agent's attendance at a meeting at which legal strategy is not
discussed does not intrude on the attorney-client relationship; therefore, the component proposed limiting this
paragraph's prohibition against government agents participating in an attorney-client meeting or communication
to situations where there is a ``reasonable basis'' to believe that the meeting or communication will concern legal
advice or strategy. The Department believes that it is unwise and unworkable to encourage government attorneys and
undercover agents to guess whether legal issues will come up in an attorney-client meeting or communication. It would
also be disruptive of the attorney-client relationship for government attorneys and undercover agents to gather
the information that might make such a determination even remotely reliable. Therefore, this paragraph has not been
changed.

Section 77.10: Organizations and Employees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section addresses the difficult issue of when a communication with an employee or member of a represented organization
should be considered a communication with the organization itself. Important interests depend on this determination.
On the one hand, organizations should not be shielded from effective criminal or civil law enforcement prosecution
simply by retaining counsel. It is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to encounter attorneys who assert that they
represent every individual in a large corporation or organization. If such attorneys were able to prevent government
investigators from gaining informal access to any employee of the organization by withholding consent, information
relevant to claims against the organization might never come to light because such information is often in the exclusive
possession of the organization and its employees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

to the effective assistance of counsel, and the relationship between an organization and its counsel deserves respect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section, and particularly the definition of ``controlling individual'' in paragraph
(a) of this section, strikes an appropriate balance, one that ensures government attorneys the ability to enforce
federal law, while preserving the opportunity for corporations and other organizations to secure effective assistance
of counsel.

Paragraph (a): Communications with current employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph states that a communication with a current employee of an organizational party or person should be
treated as a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a ``controlling
individual.'' If a communication with a current employee is properly characterized under this regulation as a communication
with a represented organization (that is, if the communication is with a controlling individual), then that communication
is subject generally to the same limitations that would apply if the communication were with a represented person
or represented party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accord with the basic structure of this regulation, which distinguishes between represented parties and represented
persons, this paragraph effectively provides that when an organization is a represented party, an attorney for the
government shall not communicate, or cause another to communicate, with any controlling individual of the organization
without the consent of the organization's attorney, subject to the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.6. In contrast,
when an organization qualifies as a represented person, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause
another to communicate, with any controlling individual, provided the communication does not violate the provisions
of &sect;&sect;77.8 or 77.9.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The definition of ``controlling individual'' is intended to encompass those individuals who typically are part
of the organization's control group. A controlling individual under this definition must: (1) be a current employee
or member of the organization; (2) hold a high-level position with the organization; (3) participate ``as a decision
maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject
matter;'' and (4) be known by the government to be engaged in such activities. This definition attempts to identify
those limited number of individuals affiliated with the organization who actually are involved in determining the
organization's position with regard to the legal proceeding or investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual and one organization questioned limiting the class of employees who should be considered ``controlling
individuals'' for purposes of this subsection to those who participate in framing the organization's legal position
in the matter. They argued that the proposed ``controlling individual'' test authorizes contacts with employees
who, while not directing the organization's counsel, nonetheless have extensive authority to act on behalf of the
organization. The underlying concern of these comments appears to be that this paragraph, as proposed, authorizes
contacts with many employees who are likely to possess information relevant to claims asserted against the corporation
and who have the capacity to make statements that a court will deem admissible at trial as evidentiary admissions against
the corporation. This is certainly true. However, the Department believes that its anti-contact rule should not
be designed with the goal of protecting corporations from disclosure of prejudicial facts. See, e.g., Action Air

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anti-contact rules such as DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 are intended to protect the attorney-client relationship
from unnecessary interference and to protect represented parties from overreaching by opposing counsel. Damage
to the attorney-client relationship inheres particularly in communications with high-level corporate employees
who have contact with the corporation's attorneys in the course of making ultimate decisions regarding choice of
counsel, implementing counsel's advice, and determining settlement and other litigation strategies. Therefore,
communications with those high-level individuals affiliated with or employed by an organization who are responsible
for employing and directing the organization's counsel and for determining legal positions taken by the organization
are the type of communications prohibited by DR 7&hyph;104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this paragraph defines ``controlling individual'' consistently with the principles underlying
the disciplinary rules on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts. The Department also believes that the alternative approaches urged by commenters would impose unacceptable
constraints on federal law enforcement. Therefore, this paragraph has not been changed.

Paragraph (b): Communications with former employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph authorizes communications with former employees of represented organizations. Because former
employees do not direct the affairs of the organization and therefore cannot be considered members of the ``control
group'' or any other controlling entity of an organization, communications with them are not considered communications
with the organization for purposes of the rule. This reasoning is consistent with the conclusion of the majority of
federal courts that have held that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) does not bar communications with former employees of a represented
corporate party. See, e.g., Hanntz

Paragraph (c): Communications With Former or Current Employees; Individual Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that if a former or current employee or a member of an organization retains his or her own counsel,
the government shall provide the same protection to him or her that would be provided under this part to any other represented
person or represented party. Communications with that individual are subject to the limitations set forth in this
part. Although this paragraph provides the general rule for such communications, paragraph (d) addresses the specific
situation in which a controlling individual of a represented organization retains separate counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph also provides that the government will not accept, for purposes of this rule, blanket claims by counsel
that he or she represents all or a large number of employees of the organization. It is important to note that this provision
is only relevant when the attorney for the government would be prohibited by some other provision of this regulation
from contacting an individual falling under the broad claims of representation under question. For example, an attorney
for the government may contact a low-level employee of a corporation, without consent of that employee's counsel
or the corporation's counsel, regarding a matter for which the corporation has already been indicted as part of an
undercover or overt factual investigation, if that individual has not been arrested or named as a defendant in a related
criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. Therefore, the fact that an attorney has stated that he or she represents
that individual will have no bearing on whether the communication is proper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a particular communication with an individual employee included in such a claim of representation would
be improper under these rules if he or she were in fact represented by counsel (for example, communications to negotiate
a plea agreement), then this paragraph provides that a government attorney must first inquire whether the employee
is in fact represented before undertaking substantive communications with the employee. As part of this inquiry,
the government attorney is not required to disclose to the employee the fact that counsel has asserted that he or she
represents the employee. If the employee indicates that he or she is not represented by counsel, it is proper for the
government attorney to treat the employee as unrepresented. If the employee indicates that he or she is represented
by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, the attorney for the government shall treat that employee as
a represented person or represented party, and any further communications with that individual shall be governed
by this regulation.

Paragraph (d): Communications with separately represented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph applies only when a controlling individual of a represented organizational party has retained separate
counsel. In such circumstances, a government attorney may not communicate with the controlling individual without
the consent of that individual's separate counsel unless the communication satisfies one of the exceptions contained
in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9 of this part. The paragraph also allows such communications if the individual does not
qualify as a represented party, initiates the communication, and waives the presence of counsel. Thus, the same rules
apply to contacts with controlling individuals of represented organizational parties who retain separate counsel
as apply to controlling individuals of represented organizational parties who are not separately represented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e): Initiation of communication by unrepresented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph addresses a relatively narrow circumstance: when a controlling individual who is not individually
represented by counsel initiates a communication with the government outside the presence of counsel for the organization.
An attorney for the government may participate in such communications if: (1) the controlling individual indicates
that he or she is speaking exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not as a representative of the organizational
party; and (2) he or she indicates that the waiver of counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed and, if willing, signs
a statement to that effect. The fact that the controlling individual indicates that he or she is speaking in his or her
personal capacity does not mean, however, that incriminating testimony received from the controlling individual
cannot be used against the represented organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the controlling individual is also a named defendant in a civil enforcement proceeding or has been arrested or charged
in a criminal action, the requirements set forth in paragraph 77.6(c) must be satisfied before any substantive communications
are made.

Section 77.11: Enforcement of This Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Paragraph (a): Exclusive enforcement by Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In order to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of the final rule, this paragraph provides that
the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce these regulations. Thus, state courts, state disciplinary
boards, and federal courts may not impose sanctions on or otherwise regulate a Department attorney engaged in federal
law enforcement activities for violations of an anti-contact rule or subject a Department attorney to regulation
under state or local federal court rules governing communications with represented parties, except as provided
in &sect;77.12. This paragraph further provides the framework for investigating allegations that a Department
attorney has violated this regulation. It provides that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
(``OPR'') shall have sole original jurisdiction to investigate such allegations and that violations will be treated
as matters of attorney discipline. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 28 CFR &sect;0.39 (establishing and defining duties of OPR). It also makes clear that the Attorney General's determination
as to whether a violation has occurred shall be final and conclusive except to the extent that the Department attorney
enjoys a right of review provided by other laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual and one organization objected to placing investigative responsibility in OPR, suggesting that OPR
had, in the past, been reluctant to share the results of its investigations. The Department recently adopted a policy
under which the results of OPR investigations are disclosed to the public if, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, there is a finding of intentional and knowing professional misconduct by a Department attorney in the course of an
investigation or litigation and the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interest of the attorney
and any law enforcement interest. Therefore, there will be meaningful disclosure of findings of violations of these
rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, allegations of professional misconduct by Department attorneys concerning violations of these rules
may be reported directly to OPR by any person. Complaints filed by members of the public will be fully and thoroughly
reviewed by OPR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this paragraph has not been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Paragraph (b): No private remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that the rule is not intended to and does not create any substantive rights for any person other
than an attorney for the government. In particular, a violation of the regulation will not provide a basis for the dismissal
of civil or criminal charges or for the suppression of evidence that is otherwise admissible. This provision accords
with existing law. Traditionally, matters relating to communications with represented persons have been treated
as matters of attorney discipline without granting substantive rights to defendants or any other persons. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are not prohibited
by the rule. Virtually all the states have adopted some version of DR 7&hyph;104 or Model Rule 4.2 that includes an ``authorized
by law'' exception. As discussed in the ``General Comments'' section, these rules, as substantive regulations duly
promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to statutory authority, have the force and effect of law. Accordingly,
communications with represented persons that are undertaken pursuant to these rules should be considered ``authorized
by law'' within the meaning of rules adopted by the various states. Such communications should therefore be consistent
with state rules wherever state bar authorities have adopted a rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception.
Thus, no conflict will arise between state and federal law in those jurisdictions with regard to communications with
represented persons. Similarly, no conflict should arise between this regulation and the federal district court
rules that have adopted an anti-contact rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception. This regulation therefore
need not give rise to any tension with any provision of state or federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department nonetheless recognizes the likelihood that government attorneys' conduct with respect to contact
with represented persons may continue to be viewed by some as inconsistent with state or local district court rules.
To effectuate fully the provisions of this regulation, it therefore is important that the regulation include a plain
statement by the Department of its intention to preempt and supersede regulation by state courts, state disciplinary
authorities, or federal district courts of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 communications by government attorneys in civil or criminal law enforcement investigations or proceedings.

 471 U.S. 707, 718 (1985) (``because agencies normally express problems in a detailed manner and can speak through
a variety of means, including regulations, preambles, interpretative statements and responses to comments, we
can expect that they will make their intention clear if they intend for their regulations to be exclusive''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no indication from any of the comments received of any confusion regarding the breadth of the Department's
intention to displace state and federal law; on the contrary, the comments in this area generally both fully grasped
and took issue with the Department's stated intention to occupy the field. Given the integral importance of the exclusive
enforcement authority to the overall regulatory scheme, however, some revisions have been made to this section to
leave no doubt that it is the express intention of these rules to completely preempt and supersede the operation of
state and local laws or rules as they relate to contacts by government attorneys in civil or criminal law enforcement
investigations or proceedings. Such occupation of the field is necessary to ensure that government attorneys' conduct
respecting contacts with represented persons be subject to uniform regulation and predictable standards, as against
potential variations in individual state and local rules and in interpretations of those rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this regulation completely preempts state or federal court regulation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts in law enforcement matters by government attorneys and those acting at their direction, with one important
exception. If the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney has committed a ``willful violation'' of any
of these rules, preemption will not apply, and that attorney will be subject to disciplinary proceedings both by the
Department and by the appropriate state disciplinary authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters argued that it is inappropriate to preclude an otherwise appropriate state or federal court disciplinary
proceeding when the Department's own rules have been violated. The Department respectfully disagrees. A primary
purpose for this regulation is to remove the substantial burden on federal law enforcement caused by uncertainty
as to what constitutes appropriate conduct by Department attorneys. This uncertainty would not be removed were it
left to the various state and federal district courts to interpret these rules and determine on their own whether they
had been violated in any particular case. For this reason, the Department believes that it is necessary that it retain
exclusive authority to determine whether one of its lawyers has breached these rules, with the important proviso
that, when there is a finding of a willful violation, a state disciplinary authority may also impose sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One United States Attorney's Office commented that the meaning of a ``willful violation'' had not been clearly explained
in the previous commentary. In response to this comment, the Department here clarifies that a ``willful violation''
means an intentional and deliberate violation of these rules, as determined by the Attorney General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Attorneys' Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the promulgation of the rules discussed above, the Department intends to add several new provisions
to the United States Attorneys' Manual to provide additional guidance to Department attorneys when they deal with
represented individuals during criminal or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has deliberately chosen to include certain baseline restrictions in the regulation and impose broader
restrictions through provisions in the Manual. In the process of determining what the appropriate Departmental
policy should be, it became clear that any regulation would have to apply to a variety of circumstances, including:
white collar and organized crime investigations, complex conspiracy investigations, individuals whose counsel
are paid by a third party, and individuals fearful of their counsel for various reasons. Accordingly, the Department
determined that the regulation should be broad in scope and should provide unambiguous guidance that would not adversely
affect federal law enforcement efforts. Thus, part 77 distinguishes between the investigative period (before indictment,
arrest, or the filing of a complaint) and the prosecutive period (after arrest or the commencement of formal proceedings).
It also distinguishes between communications that are part of a factual investigation and communications that occur
during negotiations of plea agreements, settlements, and similar legal arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planned Manual provisions will require that government attorneys consider the principles underlying the basic
prohibitions in a much wider variety of circumstances. The Department expects all Department attorneys involved
in criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings to adhere to all applicable provisions in the Manual. Failure to
do so will result in appropriate departmental action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planned changes to the Manual were included in the earlier publications simply for reference and were not subject
to the requirements of notice and comment that applied to the provisions in the proposed regulation itself. The Department
nonetheless received several comments regarding the draft Manual provisions. The Department has carefully considered
those comments and has decided that it is appropriate (though not required) to respond to them briefly in this commentary.
However, none of the comments received has prompted the Department to conclude that it should alter the planned Manual
provisions. The Department anticipates that the Manual provisions will be substantially similar to the draft published
in March 1994. The Department envisions publishing the Manual provisions soon and integrating them in the Manual
with the final rules adopted here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were directed mainly to a draft Manual provision that would prohibit a government attorney from communicating
overtly about the subject matter of a representation with a person who the government attorney knows is a ``target''
of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation and who the government attorney knows is represented by
counsel, without the consent of the target's attorney. (The provisions, as published in March 1994, would also provide
several exceptions to this general prohibition against overt contacts with targets, including the following: when
the communication is initiated by the target; when the communication occurs at the time of arrest and the represented
person has waived his or her 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Miranda
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rights; when the government attorney believes the contact is necessary to protect against a risk to human life or safety;
or when a senior Department official determines that exigent circumstances exist, making the communication necessary
for effective law enforcement). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two United States Attorney's Offices urged reconsideration of the guideline generally prohibiting Department
attorneys from directly communicating with known ``targets.'' These commenters expressed a number of concerns
about the ``target'' provision_most significantly, that the determination of ``target'' status would be subjective
and variable and that the proposed limitation on overt contacts with represented targets would interfere with the
investigative process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not agree that the term ``target'' would make application of this planned restriction particularly
troublesome. While determinations of ``target'' status surely are not scientifically precise, neither are a range
of other similar determinations (e.g., ``probable cause'' determinations) that prosecutors are expected routinely
to make. In its enforcement of the planned provision, the Department intends to give substantial deference to a federal
attorney's good faith judgment regarding the likelihood that a particular person will ultimately become a defendant.
Even if the attorney for the government believes that an individual probably will be named as a defendant, that individual
would not be considered a target until the government has actually obtained substantial evidence linking that individual
to the commission of a crime or to unlawful conduct. The government attorney's uncorroborated belief that an individual
will ultimately be named as a defendant would not be enough. Thus, an individual will not be considered a target under
the Manual guidelines until both the attorney for the government believes that he or she will probably be named as a
defendant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 substantial evidence has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also does not believe that the contemplated restriction on overt communications with represented
targets would significantly impede legitimate law enforcement activities. It is true that in certain types of cases
and under certain exceptional circumstances, target interviews may be necessary for effective investigation;
for that reason, the planned Manual provisions would allow that in such situations target interviews may be approved
by a high-ranking Department official. However, as a general matter and in more routine circumstances, overt communications
with targets have a more limited value to the investigative process, which is outweighed by the risk that they will
interfere with the attorney-client relationship and place undue pressure on the target. Because an individual who
is a target of a federal investigation is typically in a clearly adversarial relationship with the federal government,
the Department believes that the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are implicated and that the planned
restrictions on overt communications with represented targets are appropriate.

principles underlying Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, while eliminating
the uncertainty and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations given to that rule and analogous rules
by state and federal courts and by bar association organizations and committees. (Copies of the Bar rules are on file
in most law libraries, and through on-line legal research services).

516; to direct officers of the Department to conduct grand jury proceedings and other civil and criminal legal proceedings,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 515(a); to supervise litigation and to direct Department officers in the discharge of their
duties, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 519; and otherwise to direct Department officers to detect and prosecute crimes, to
prosecute offenses against the United States, to prosecute civil actions, suits, and proceedings in which the United
States is concerned, and to perform such other functions in an appropriate and ethical manner as may be provided by
law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 533, and 547.

with a represented person or represented party pursuant to any provision of these regulations without the consent
of counsel, the following restrictions must be observed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deference to attorney-client relationship. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An attorney for the government, or anyone acting at his or her direction may not, when communicating with a represented
person or represented party: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Inquire about information regarding lawful defense strategy or legal arguments of counsel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Disparage counsel for a represented person or represented party or otherwise seek to induce the person to forego

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the
Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney finds that there is a substantial
likelihood that there exists a significant conflict of interest between a represented person or party and his or her
attorney; and that it is not feasible to obtain a judicial order challenging the representation, then an attorney
for the government with prior written authorization from an official identified above may apprise the person of the
nature of the perceived conflict of interest, unless the exigencies of the situation permit only prior oral authorization,
in which case such oral authorization shall be memorialized in writing as soon thereafter as possible.

to attend or participate in lawful attorney-client meetings or communications, except when the agent or witness
is requested to do so by the represented person or party, defense counsel, or another person affiliated or associated
with the defense, and when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of the agent or witness or the confidentiality
of an undercover operation. If the agent or witness attends or participates in such meetings, any information regarding
lawful defense strategy or trial preparation imparted to the agent or witness shall not be communicated to attorneys
for the government or to law enforcement agents who are directly participating in the ongoing investigation or in
the prosecution of pending criminal charges, or used in any other way to the substantial detriment of the client.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with current employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A communication with a current employee of an organization that qualifies as a represented party or represented person
shall be considered to be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling
individual. A ``controlling individual'' is a current high level employee who is known by the government to be participating
as a decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation
of the subject matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A communication with a former employee of an organization that is represented by counsel shall not be considered to
be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former or current employees; individual representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A communication with a former or current employee of an organization who is individually represented by counsel may
occur only to the extent otherwise permitted by this part. However, a claim by an attorney that he or she represents
all or a large number of individual current and/or former employees of an organization does not suffice to establish
that those employees are represented persons or represented parties under this part. In such circumstances, prior
to engaging in communications that would be prohibited under this part as a result of the individual representation,
the attorney for the government shall communicate with the individual current or former employee to determine if
in fact that employee is represented by counsel concerning the subject matter of the investigation or proceeding.

Communications with separately represented controlling individuals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When this part would preclude discussions with a controlling individual as defined in &sect;77.10(a) and the controlling
individual has retained separate counsel on the relevant subject matter, an attorney for the government may communicate
with such individual in the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the controlling individual's separate counsel consents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the communication falls within one of the exceptions set forth in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case in which the individual does not qualify as a represented party, if the individual initiates the communication
and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not on behalf of the represented
organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel for the communication is voluntary, knowing
and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initiation of communication with unrepresented controlling individuals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an attorney for the government may communicate with a controlling
individual who is not individually represented as to the subject matter of the communication when the controlling
individual initiates the communication and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal
capacity and not on behalf of the represented organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel
for the communication is voluntary, knowing, and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this
effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to affect the requirements of Rule 44(c) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, or to permit the multiple representation of an organization and any of its employees, or the
multiple representation of more than one such employee, if such representation is prohibited by any applicable law
or rule of attorney ethics.

 The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority over this part and any violations of it, except as provided in
&sect;77.12. Allegations of violations of this part shall be reviewed exclusively by the Office of Professional
Responsibility of the Department of Justice and shall be addressed when appropriate as matters of attorney discipline
by the Department. The Office of Professional Responsibility shall review any complaint alleging a violation of
this part made by a state or federal judge, bar disciplinary board, official, or ethics committee, or by any other person
or entity. The findings of the Attorney General or her designee as to an attorney's compliance or non-compliance with
this part shall be final and conclusive except insofar as the attorney for the government is afforded a right of review
by other provisions of law.

 This part is not intended to and does not create substantive rights on behalf of criminal or civil defendants, targets
or subjects of investigations, witnesses, counsel for represented parties or represented persons, or any other
person other than an attorney for the government, and shall not be a basis for dismissing criminal or civil charges
or proceedings against represented parties or for excluding relevant evidence in any proceeding in any court of the
United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Communications with represented parties and represented persons pursuant to this part are intended to constitute
communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model
Rules of Professional Conduct, DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, and analogous
state and local federal court rules. In addition, this part is intended to preempt and supersede the application of
state laws and rules and local federal court rules to the extent that they relate to contacts by attorneys for the government,
and those acting at their direction or under their supervision, with represented parties or represented persons
in criminal or civil law enforcement investigations or proceedings; it is designed to preempt the entire field of
rules concerning such contacts. When the Attorney General finds a willful violation of any of the rules in this part,
however, sanctions for the conduct that constituted a willful violation of this part may be applied, if warranted,
by the appropriate state disciplinary authority.
