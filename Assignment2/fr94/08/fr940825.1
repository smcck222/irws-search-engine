SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to airplanes with certain Brackett
Aircraft Company, Inc. (Brackett) air filter assemblies incorporating a neoprene gasket design installed between
the carburetor heat box and the air filter frame. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting (visually)
the air filter frame for a loose or deteriorating gasket, and replacing any gasket found loose or deteriorated. An
accident report where a Cessna Model 172 airplane experienced engine loss because a six-inch piece of neoprene gasket
material was lodged in the carburetor prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent gasket particles from entering the carburetor because of air filter gasket failure, which could result
in partial or complete loss of engine power.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received a report of an accident report where a Cessna Model 172 airplane experienced engine loss because
a six-inch piece of gasket material was lodged in the carburetor venturi throat. The material matched the remaining
neoprene gasket on the Brackett air filter, Assembly No. BA&hyph;5110, installed in accordance with STC SA71GL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Brackett Aircraft Company, Inc., has issued Brackett Air Filter Document I&hyph;194, dated March 16, 1994. This
document specifies inspection and replacement procedures for these Brackett air filters utilizing neoprene gaskets
installed in accordance with STC SA71GL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incident described above
including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent gasket
particles from entering the carburetor because of air filter gasket failure, which could result in partial or complete
loss of engine power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other airplanes incorporating
the Brackett air filter neoprene gasket design installed in accordance with STC SA71GL, the proposed AD would require
repetitively inspecting (visually) the air filter frame for a loose or deteriorated gasket, and replacing any gasket
found loose or deteriorated. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Brackett Air Filter Document
I&hyph;194, dated March 16, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 50,000 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,750,000
or $55 per operator. This figure does not reflect costs for repetitive inspections or possible replacements; only
the initial inspection. The FAA has no way of determining how many gaskets may need replacement or how many repetitive
inspections each operator may incur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption

To prevent gasket particles from entering the carburetor because of air filter gasket failure, which could result
in partial or complete loss of engine power, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Visually inspect the inside and outside of the air filter frame for gasket looseness, movement, or deterioration
in accordance with Brackett Air Filter Document I&hyph;194, dated March 16, 1994. If any gasket looseness, movement,
or deterioration is found, prior to further flight, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Remove the air filter frame by removing the screws, nuts, and washers on the air filter frame (3 to 4 each). Note that
the screws securing the grill to the frame need not be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Remove and replace the neoprene gasket in accordance with Brackett Air Filter Document 1&hyph;194. Inspect the
carburetor in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual for gasket material ingestion. Remove any material
ingested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Reinstall the filter frame to the carburetor heat box with the screws, nuts, and washers (3 to 4 each) that were removed
earlier. Torque each nut to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the neoprene gasket is compressed to one-half its original thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with &sect;&sect;21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be
accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of
safety may be approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, 3229 E. Spring Street,
Long Beach, California 90806. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the Act) contains provisions to assure safe and healthful working
conditions for Federal employees. Under that section, it is the responsibility of the head of each Federal agency
to establish and maintain an effective and comprehensive occupational safety and health program which is consistent
with the standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. The Secretary of Labor (the Secretary), under section 19,
is to report to the President certain evaluations and recommendations with respect to the programs of the various
agencies, and the duties which section 24 of the Act imposes on the Secretary of Labor necessarily extend to the collection,
compilation, and analysis of the occupational safety and health statistics from the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and Health Programs for Federal Employees, issued February 26, 1980,
prescribes additional responsibilities for the heads of agencies, the Secretary, and the General Services Administrator.
Among other duties, the Secretary is required to issue basic program element in accordance with which the heads of
agencies shall operate their safety and health programs. These basic program elements are set forth in 29 CFR Part
1960. Although agency heads are required to comply with all standards issued under section 6 of the Act and to operate
a program in accordance with the basic program elements, those elements contain numerous provisions which, by their
terms, permit agency heads the flexibility necessary to implement their programs in a manner consistent with their
respective missions, sizes, and organization. Thus, an agency head, after consultation with agency employees or
their representatives and with appropriate safety and health committees may request the Secretary to consider approval
of an alternate standard. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1960.17, when requesting an alternate standard the agency head must do
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any request by the head of the agency for an alternate standard shall be transmitted to the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any such request for an alternate standard shall not be approved by the Secretary unless it provides equivalent
or greater protection for affected employees. Any such request shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A statement of why the agency cannot comply with the OSHA standard or wants to adopt an alternate standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A description of the alternate standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An explanation of how the alternate standard provides equivalent or greater protection for the affected employees;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A description of interim protective measures afforded employees until a decision is rendered by the Secretary
of Labor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A summary of written comments, if any, from interested employees, employee representative, and occupational
safety and health committees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Notice is a request for comment on the proposed alternate standard submitted to OSHA by the FAA. This action is
intended to assist the Secretary in assuring that ample opportunity has been given to allow affected employees, employee
representatives and interested parties, such as occupational safety and health committees, to comment on the effectiveness
of the proposed alternate standard and on its equivalence to appropriate OSHA standards. The Secretary also believes
that review of this alternate standard by the scientific community and those National Committees responsible for
developing comparable standards is essential so that workers in ATCTs are free from the hazards posed by inappropriate
means of egress.

Alternate Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA provided materials in support of the proposed alternate standard to 29 CFR 1910.36 (b)(8). FAA's request was
based on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A number of specifications established in the existing alternate standard for ATCTs require types of construction
beyond those mandated in OSHA regulations or in life safety and building codes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A licensed fire protection engineer has provided several alternate protection measures for ATCTs which were
not included in the existing alternate standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The existing alternate standard does not address important operational ATCT requirements (e.g., 360 degrees
field of vision at the cab level) or their relationship with protective structural or procedural features.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to the existing alternate standard provides types of ATCT construction and methods of operation which
enhance the fire detection and notification, fire resistance, smoke control, and emergency response features for
ATCTs. These features provide early warning of the presence of fire or smoke, flame and smoke spread control, and automatic
notification of emergency response units such that a level of fire safety equivalent to two means of egress are afforded
ATCT occupants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA contends that the alternate standard provides equivalent or greater protection for the affected employees because

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. General. Airport Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) are unique structures used for the control of aircraft, usually
over or near an airport facility. The distinctive mission of ATCTs requires ATCT designs that permit 360
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; visibility at the cab level and, in many cases, sufficient space for radar equipment and administrative activities
related to ATCT operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This standard applies to all ATCTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Specific. This standard sets forth minimum fundamental requirements essential to providing a safe means of egress
from fire and similar emergencies. Nothing in this standard shall be construed to prohibit a better type of building
construction, more exits, or otherwise safer conditions than the minimum requirements specified herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Equivalent Protection. The use of alternative arrangements or construction, developed or approved by a licensed
fire protection engineer, may be permitted by the authority having jurisdiction when it is shown that these features
provide a level of safety to life equivalent to that required in this standard or, where this standard is silent on an
issue, by other standards or codes.

6. Width and Capacity of Means of Egress
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The capacity of the means of egress for any floor, balcony, tier, or other occupied space shall be sufficient for
the occupant load thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The minimum exit width shall not be less than 28 inches for existing ATCTs and not less than 36 inches for new ATCTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Exit width shall be measured in the clear at the narrowest point of the means of egress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A door during its swing shall not reduce the width of the means of egress to one-half of the required exit width.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When fully open, a door shall not project more than 7 inches into the required width of an aisle, corridor, passageway,
or landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Where a single way of exit access leads to an exit, its capacity in terms of width shall be at least equal to the required
capacity of the exit to which it leads. Where more than one way of exit access leads to an exit, each shall have a width
adequate for the number of persons it must accommodate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Means of egress shall be measured in inches per person. The ATCT egress capacity shall be 0.3 inch per person for
stairways and 0.2 inch per person for level components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Level Egress Components. (including Class A Ramps). If an entry doorway has 28 inches clear width, a discharge
doorway has 28 inches clear width, and a stairway is 30 inches wide, the egress capacity would be 100 persons, or the
smallest of the three capacities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Material Provided in Support of the Proposed Alternate Standard to 29 CFR 1910.36(b)(8)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A statement of why the agency cannot comply with the OSHA standard or wants to adopt an alternate standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing alternate standard was proposed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and accepted by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for Airport Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) in 1982 in recognition of the
characteristic structure of ATCTs and the unique FAA mission to control aircraft from these buildings. Contributing
factors in the DOT pursuit of an alternate standard included the feasibility of using alternate life safety measures
which provided an equivalent level of protection for ATCT occupants, the enormous expense and impracticality of
adding a second exit to existing ATCTs or constructing ATCTs with two remote exits, and the need to minimize disruption
of the commercial and private aviation activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT requests modification to the existing alternate standard for ATCTs for the reasons stated below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A number of specifications established in the existing alternate standard for ATCTs require types of construction
beyond those mandated in OSHA regulations or in life safety and building codes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A licensed fire protection engineer has provided several alternative protection measures for ATCTs which
were not included in the existing alternate standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The existing alternate standard does not address important operational ATCT requirements (e.g., 360
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; field of vision at the cab level) or their relationship with protective structural or procedural features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the alternate standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to the existing alternate standard provides types of ATCT construction and methods of operation which
enhance the fire detection and notification, fire resistance, smoke control, and emergency response features for
ATCTs. These features provide early warning of the presence of fire or smoke, flame and smoke spread control, and automatic
notification of emergency response units such that a level of fire safety equivalent to two means of egress are afforded
ATCT occupants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An explanation of how the alternate standard provides equivalent or greater protection for the affected employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhancements to the alternate standard include:

Pending approval of the proposed alternate standard, DOT has completed standard design ATCT structural fire safety
enhancements proposed by the Rolf Jensen Associates licensed fire protection engineer. These enhancements comply
with the proposed alternate standard. Other ATCTs are currently under going review by the licensed fire protection
engineer contractor and up-grades are scheduled for completion by December 1994. In the interim, DOT has initiated
a program in which ATCT employees are trained in emergency response techniques (evacuation plan, fire response techniques,
and fire extinguisher use), agreements are made with local fire and rescue response units to ensure prompt fire control
and medical service response, smoke detectors and fire alarms are installed, and housekeeping material and storage
practices are improved.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Idaho for the purpose
of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with
an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The SIP revision was submitted
by the State to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for an acceptable moderate nonattainment area
PM&hyph;10 SIP for Pinehurst, Idaho. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in
<!-- PJG 0172 columnbreak -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public
comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute
a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so by September
26, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act as amended on November 15, 1990 (``the Act''), the EPA has promulgated
rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards
and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of a State operating permits program
(see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires
States to develop, and submit to the EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources
and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to the EPA by November 15, 1993, and that the EPA act to
approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs
pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval and disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, the EPA may grant the program
interim approval for a period of up to two years. If the EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1993, date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.

Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Act, the Governor of each State is required to develop and submit to the Administrator
an operating permits program under State or local law or under an interstate compact, meeting the requirements of
title V of the Act. Louisiana submitted, under the signature of Governor Edwin W. Edwards, the operating permits program,
prepared by LDEQ, to be implemented in all areas of the State of Louisiana with the exception of Indian Lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the LDEQ operating permits program submittal, LDEQ does not assert jurisdiction over Indian lands or reservations.
To date, no tribal government in Louisiana has authority to administer an independent air program in the State. Upon
promulgation of the Indian air regulations, the Indians will then be able to apply as a State, and receive the authority
from the EPA to implement an operating permits program under title V of the Act. The EPA will, where appropriate, conduct
a Federal title V operating permits program in accordance with forthcoming EPA regulations, for those Indian tribes
which do not apply for treatment as States under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(1) requires that the submittal contain a program description of Louisiana's operating permits program
describing how LDEQ intends to carry out its responsibilities under the part 70 regulations. The program description,
contained in Volume I of the submittal, explains that this operating permits program was developed to satisfy all
of the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The operating permits program will incorporate the review and issuance procedures
for part 70 operating permits into the existing State preconstruction permit review and issuance procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program description contains a description of the organizational structure of the LDEQ Air Quality Division
and a description of the agency's permit related responsibilities. The Air Quality Division is divided into nine
sections. Through the Small Business Assistance Section, the LDEQ provides technical assistance to small businesses
to help them comply with new regulations under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(3) requires the Governor to submit a legal opinion from the Attorney General (or the attorney for the
State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate authority to carry
out all aspects of a title V operating permits program. The State of Louisiana submitted an Attorney General's Opinion
under the First Assistant Attorney General's signature demonstrating adequate legal authority as required by Federal
law and regulation for source category-limited interim approval as further discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's Opinion contains documentation of adequate legal authority to carry out the issuance of permits
to all sources subject to the requirements of the part 70 regulations, and to promulgate regulations in compliance
with applicable State and Federal laws. The Attorney General's Opinion cites 30 Louisiana Revised Statute (L.R.S.)
2023, which establishes a maximum permit term of ten years, and allows LDEQ to modify a permit for cause in accordance
with law, rule or regulation. Through these statutory provisions LDEQ has developed regulations which provide a
five-year permit term for all sources, and which allow permits to be terminated, modified, or revoked and reissued
for cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LDEQ has the authority to enforce the regulations either through an administrative action to require compliance
or a civil action to compel compliance and recover penalties. Penalties for administrative and civil enforcement
are consistent with the penalty requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.11. The State also possesses criminal authority
to compel enforcement. However, for criminal violations, the State law requires a willful and knowing violation,
while part 70 only requires a knowing violation. The Attorney General's Opinion demonstrates through case law that
there is no distinction between these two requirements under Louisiana law. Therefore, this difference is not a defect
for purposes of part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 L.R.S. section 2025(F)(1) provides that an emission of any substance in contravention of regulations, permit
terms, and conditions pursuant thereto, that endangers or that could endanger human life or health, is a felony subject
to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or the cost of cleanup, and an additional fine of up to $100,000 per violation, which
may be assessed for each day the violation continues, and imprisonment of up to ten years. 30 L.R.S. section 2025(F)(2)
requires that a person who commits a violation of an emission limitation or non-emission related applicable requirement
or permit condition that does not endanger or could not endanger human life or health is guilty of a misdemeanor and
may be fined not more that $25,000 per violation, which may be assessed for each day the violation continues and imprisonment
of up to one year. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.11 which requires criminal penalties to be recoverable in a maximum
amount of not less than $10,000 per day per violation for any knowing violation of any applicable requirement, any
permit condition, or fee or filing requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All records of LDEQ are available to the public under 44 L.R.S. sections 1 and 31, unless the Secretary determines that
disclosure would either impair an ongoing investigation or disclose trade secrets. This statute provides that certain
environmental information such as air emission data may not be held confidential. However, it is not clear whether
these confidentiality provisions could be interpreted to protect from disclosure the contents of the permit itself.
As a condition of full approval, LDEQ will be required either to submit an Attorney General's Opinion demonstrating
that its statute is interpreted not to allow any portion of a permit to be held confidential, consistent with section
503(e) of the Act, or to revise Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC) 33:III. Chapter 5, AQ#70, section 517.F to clarify
that no portion of the permit may be considered confidential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State statute requires judicial review and a civil judicial order to proceed with permit issuance as the only remedy
available for failure of LDEQ to act on a permit application within the specific time requirements. The judicial review
provided by the State meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 L.R.S. sections 2011(D)(2), 2022, and 2023 of the State statute allows LDEQ discretionary authority to issue variances.
The EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the operating permits program submittal and therefore the statutory
variance provision is not being approved as part of the title V operating permits program. Any variances that may be
issued by LDEQ will not have the effect of revising the title V permit or relieving the source from compliance with any
requirements of the Act unless the variance is processed through title V modification procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's opinion has demonstrated that oil and gas wellheads and pipelines will not constitute part
70 sources. Such a demonstration was required by the State statutory provision at 30 L.R.S. section 2022(C)(1) which
allowed for default issuance of State permits to wellheads and pipelines 74 days after receipt of a permit application
by the permitting authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's opinion has also demonstrated that cotton gins will not constitute part 70 sources. This demonstration
was required because the State statute prohibits the State from regulating controlled burning of cotton gin agricultural
wastes in connection with cotton gin operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 L.R.S. section 2054(B)(2)(b) provides that the Secretary of the LDEQ has no jurisdiction or authority to make any
regulation with respect to burning of agricultural by-products in the field in connection with the planting, harvesting
or processing of agricultural products, or with respect to controlled burning in connection with timber stand management
or with respect to controlled burning of pastureland or marshland in connection with trapping or livestock production.
These sources do not meet the part 70 definition of major source because air emissions from these sources are fugitive,
and 40 CFR 70.2 does not require that fugitive emissions be counted in determining whether such sources are major for
purposes of section 302(j) of the Act or title I nonattainment definitions of ``major source.'' Therefore, the State's
lack of authority to permit the types of controlled burning described in this section of Louisiana law is not a defect
in Louisiana's part 70 operating permits program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permit program documentation not contained in the regulations,
such as permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its operating permits program.
The State addresses this requirement in Volumes I and III of its title V operating permits program submittal. Volume
III contains a model permit, application forms and instructions, including the standard Phase II acid rain forms.
Volume I contains a description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program, including the criteria
for monitoring source compliance.

The State of Louisiana has submitted Air Quality Division regulations LAC 33:III. Chapter 5, AQ#70&hyph;''Permit
Procedures'' (``the permit regulations'') and LAC 33:III. Chapter 65, AQ#76&hyph;''Rules and Regulations for
the Fee System of the Air Quality Control Programs'' (``the fee regulations''), for implementing the State's operating
permits program as required by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was
submitted in Volume III of the submittal. Copies of all applicable State and local statutes and regulations which
authorize the part 70 program, including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with
the State's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following requirements, set out in the EPA's part 70 regulation, are addressed in the State's submittal: (1) Provisions
to determine applicability (40 CFR 70.3(a)): AQ#70 section 507.A.1; (2) Provisions to determine complete applications
(40 CFR 70.5(a)(2)) and program documentation (40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)): AQ#70 section 519 and AQ#70 section 517 respectively,
and Volume III, Permit Forms and Instructions; (3) Public Participation (40 CFR 70.7(h)): AQ#70 section 531.A; (4)
Provisions for minor permit modifications (40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)): AQ#70 section 525; (5) Provisions for permit content
(40 CFR 70.6(a)); Volume III, Permit Forms and Instructions; (6) Provisions for operational flexibility (40 CFR
70.4(b)(12)): AQ#70 section 507.G; (7) Provisions to determine insignificant activities (40 CFR 70.4(b)(2)):
A list of insignificant activities was not included with the submittal and may be submitted as a revision at a later
date; (8) Enforcement provisions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(5) and 70.4(b)(4)(ii)): 30 L.R.S. section 2025.F and Volume I,
Enforcement and Compliance Programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following is a discussion of certain specific provisions in the State's submission as they relate to requirements
of 40 CFR part 70:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Applicability criteria, including any criteria used to determine insignificant activities or emissions levels
(40 CFR 70.4(b)(2) and 70.3(a)): These requirements are met by AQ#70 section 517 which requires the permit application
to include information regarding emissions from sources of all regulated air pollutants and does not allow an exemption
for insignificant activities. The permit regulations require that the applicable sources submit an application
prior to construction, reconstruction, or modification which may result in an increase in air contaminants. AQ#70
section 507.A.3 requires that permits incorporate all federally applicable requirements for each emissions unit
at the source. AQ#70 section 507.A requires all major sources, all sources required to obtain an operating permit
pursuant to regulations promulgated under sections 111 or 112 of the Act (except sources that would be required to
obtain a permit solely because they are regulated sources pursuant to section 112(r) of the Act), and all affected
sources under the acid rain program to apply for and receive an operating permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of a regulation involving research and development (R &amp; D) facilities discussed below, the State will
lack authority to ensure that all part 70 sources submit an application in the first year after interim approval. This
defect in the State's authority will render the interim approval granted to the Louisiana operating permits program,
a source category-limited interim approval. Further discussion of this issue follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 501.B.7 provides that the permitting authority may allow a
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
certain complex within a facility to be considered as a source separate from the facility with which it is co-located,
provided that the complex is used solely for R &amp; D of new processes and/or products, and is not engaged in the manufacture
of products for commercial sale. The permit regulations are inconsistent with 40 CFR 70.3 which requires that a State's
operating permits program provide for the permitting of all major sources, and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i) which requires
that the State demonstrate adequate legal authority to issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable
requirement by all part 70 sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Confusion over this issue has occurred as a result of language in the preamble to the final July 21, 1992, 40 CFR part
70 rulemaking (57 FR 32264). The preamble language indicates that States would have the flexibility in many cases
to treat R &amp; D facilities separately from the manufacturing facilities with which they are co-located. The EPA
intended for this language to clarify the flexibility in part 70 for allowing R &amp; D facilities to be treated separately
in cases where the R &amp; D facility has a different two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (``SIC'') code
and is not a support facility. This approach is consistent with the treatment of R &amp; D facilities in the New Source
Review program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.2 requires all sources located on contiguous or adjacent properties, under common control, and belonging
to a single major industrial grouping to be considered as the same source. The Louisiana permit regulations could
cause certain part 70 major sources, as defined in 40 CFR 70.2, or portions of such sources with the same SIC code, to
be treated as separate sources. This could cause some part 70 sources to be exempted from coverage by part 70 permits
which must ensure all part 70 requirements for these sources are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's August 2, 1993, guidance provides that the EPA can grant source category-limited interim approval to States
whose programs do not provide for permitting all required sources if the State makes a showing that two criteria are
met: (1) That there were ``compelling reasons'' for the exclusions; and (2) that all required sources will be permitted
on a schedule that ``substantially meets'' the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The EPA considers Louisiana's misinterpretation
of the preamble language to be a compelling reason for granting this type of interim approval. Louisiana has not requested
additional time for issuing initial permits. In addition, it has been estimated that a small number of major sources
will be deferred from permitting due to the Louisiana R &amp; D provision, and that such sources can still be permitted
within the three-year time frame. This substantially meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Also, for these reasons,
the EPA is not requesting a detailed, written analysis supporting the State's claim that its program substantially
meets the part 70 applicability requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source category-limited interim approval will allow Louisiana to develop a permitting schedule to provide for the
permitting of any ``exempted'' sources during the latter part of the program's three-year transition period, after
the permit regulations have been revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the granting of source category-limited interim approval based on the possibility that some major
sources will not be required to submit applications within the first year after program approval, the EPA expects
that any permits issued will address all applicable requirements, as required by 40 CFR 70.7(a)(1)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For full part 70 approval, the LDEQ will be required to revise its permit regulations and demonstrate that no source
or portion of a source which would be defined as major under 40 CFR 70.2 will be exempted from part 70 requirements because
an R &amp; D facility is co-located with the source. Guidance on the R &amp; D issue is expected to be forthcoming from
the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards in the near future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 502 defines ``title I modification'' as a change at a site that qualifies as a modification under section
111 of the Act, or section 112(g) of the Act, or that results in a significant net emissions increase under part C or part
D of the Act. The EPA believes the phrase ``modifications under any provision of title I of the Act'' in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5)
is best interpreted to mean literally any change at a source that would trigger permitting authority review under
regulations approved or promulgated under title I of the Act. This would include State preconstruction review programs
approved by the EPA into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and regulations
addressing source changes that trigger National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) established
pursuant to section 112 prior to the 1990 amendments. The EPA intends to revise its criteria for interim approval in
40 CFR 70.4(d) prior to final approval on the proposal to grant Louisiana interim approval so that interim approval
may be granted to State programs, like Louisiana's, that adopt a narrower definition of ``title I modification''
than the Federal definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, the EPA believes the better interpretation of ``title I modification'' would preclude granting full approval
to the Louisiana operating permits program. However, in the proposal to revise 40 CFR part 70, the EPA will be taking
comment on whether the criteria in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A), including the phrase ``modification under any provision
of title I,'' should be interpreted in a manner that would allow the minor modification process to be used for changes
reviewed under programs approved pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and changes that trigger the application
of NESHAPS established pursuant to section 112 of the Act prior to the 1990 amendments. Should the EPA adopt this alternative
interpretation of ``title I modification'' which allows the minor modification process to be used for changes reviewed
under programs approved pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and changes that trigger the application of NESHAPS
established pursuant to section 112 of the Act prior to the 1990 amendments, the definition of ``title I modification''
in Louisiana's operating permits program would then be fully consistent with the 40 CFR part 70 ``title I modification''
definition without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the definition of ``major source'', the definition in AQ#70 section 502 is broader than the part 70 definition
because it does not require the sources to belong to a single major industrial grouping. This is approvable under part
70, and will result in more sources being covered by the State's operating permits program than would be required by
the part 70 definition of ``major source.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Permit application requirements (40 CFR 70.5(c)): These requirements are addressed in AQ#70 section 517. In
addition to the information required to be submitted by 40 CFR 70.5(c), the permit regulations also require the submittal
of a location map of the facility. AQ#70 section 507.G provides for alternative operating scenarios, consistent
with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12), and requires the sources requesting alternative operating scenarios
to submit the information in accordance with AQ#70 section 517.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Permit issuance and revision procedures (40 CFR 70.7): These requirements are met by the permit regulations.
AQ#70 section 507.C.1 requires all existing sources to submit an application within one year of the effective date
of the State's operating permits program approval. AQ#70 section 507.C.2 requires that a permit application be submitted
prior to construction, reconstruction, or modification of any source. Permit applications for renewal are required
at least six months prior to the date of permit expiration, but not more than eighteen months prior to the date of permit
expiration. The permit regulations contain criteria for determining completeness of applications consistent
with 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2). Consistent with 40 CFR 70.7, the permit regulations prohibit a source from operating after
the time that the source is required to submit a timely and complete application. AQ#70 section 507.B includes provisions
for continuing permits or permit terms if a timely and complete application is submitted, but action is not taken on
a request prior to permit expiration consistent with 40 CFR 70.4(b)(10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b contains the deadlines for submittal of acid rain permit applications. Although this section
purports to cover all relevant dates for submittal of acid rain permit applications, however, this section does not
contain the deadlines required by 40 CFR 72.30(b)(2)(iii) for new units and for units that did not serve a generator
with a name plate capacity greater than 25 Megawatts electrical on November 15, 1990, but which serve such a generator
after November 15, 1990. AQ#70 section 505.D.2 contains the deadlines for submittal of acid rain permit applications
consistent with those required by title IV of the Act, but contradicts AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b. Even though AQ#70
section 505.A.4 states that any requirement, provision, or emissions limitation of the Federal regulations of the
acid rain program, where applicable to an affected source, shall supersede LAC 33:III Chapter 5 of the Louisiana Regulations
to the extent that such Federal regulations are inconsistent with those permit regulations, the inconsistency between
AQ#70 section 505.D.2, 507.C.1.b and the Federal acid rain regulations creates a lack of clarity and should be eliminated.
Therefore, for full part 70 approval, AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b must be revised to require the affected sources to comply
with the deadlines in LAC 33.III.505.D.2 consistent with 40 CFR parts 70 and 72.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 519 contains provisions regarding completeness determinations and requests for additional information
consistent with 40 CFR 70.4(b)(6), 70.5(a)(2) and 70.7(a)(4). Requirements for application contents are found
in AQ#70 section 517.D and are consistent with 40 CFR 70.5(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 521 contains the requirements for administrative amendments. AQ#70 section 521.A.5 allows an administrative
amendment for the incorporation of changes to render preconstruction permit terms and conditions consistent with
emissions data and operating parameters as determined by start-up testing results provided the following criteria
are met: a. The changes are a result of a test performed upon start-up of newly constructed, installed, or modified
equipment or operations; b. increases in permitted emissions will not exceed 5 tons per year for any regulated pollutant;
c. increases in permitted emissions of Louisiana toxic air pollutants or of Federal hazardous air pollutants would
not constitute a modification under LAC 33:III. Chapter 51 or under section 112(g) of the Act; d. changes in emissions
would not require new source review for prevention of significant deterioration or nonattainment, and would not
trigger the applicability of any federally applicable requirement; e. changes in emissions would not qualify as
a significant modification; f. the request is submitted no later than 12 months after commencing operation; and g.
the permit contains a term which provides for the incorporation of test results by administrative amendment in accordance
with the section entitled ``Administrative Amendments.'' The EPA considers these provisions to be similar in many
respects to the authority allowed for reasonably anticipated operating scenarios without a permit revision under
40 CFR 70.6(a)(9), because the permit will give adequate notice of and provide limitations on the changes that may
occur through a subsequent administrative amendment. In addition, these provisions are consistent with part 70
revision procedures because they achieve substantially the same result as would be the case if Louisiana's preconstruction
and operating permitting programs were separate. Since, if these programs were separate, 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(ii)
and 70.4(b)(14) together would allow changes to preconstruction permits to occur prior to revision of the part 70
permit (unless such changes conflicted with an existing part 70 permit), the use of an expedited revision procedure
for incorporation of test results, such as that in AQ#70 section 521.A.6, produces substantially equivalent results
where the preconstruction and operating permit programs are merged. In light of these considerations, the EPA believes
this provision is consistent with part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 521.A.6 provides that an administrative amendment may be used to revise a permit for changes that would
not violate any applicable requirement or standard, which do not require permit modifications under 40 CFR part 70
and which the permitting authority considers to be similar in nature to the changes listed in that subsection. This
provision could be interpreted to allow administrative amendments to permits to incorporate changes authorized
by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(14). These ``off-permit'' changes, which are not addressed or prohibited by the permit, may be made
under part 70 without permit revisions. However, the part 70 rule contains no authority for such changes to be incorporated
into operating permits except through the appropriate part 70 permit procedures, which may be either a minor or significant
modification. Therefore, for full part 70 approval, section 521.A.6 must be revised to eliminate administrative
amendments for this type of change. In the interim, the EPA expects Louisiana to implement this provision in a manner
consistent with 40 CFR part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 521.A.6 also allows changes to be made to operating permits by administrative amendment where the State's
permitting authority has determined they are similar to the changes listed in AQ#70 section 521.A. Part 70 allows
changes submitted as part of a State's part 70 program, in addition to those specified in 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1), to be made
as administrative amendments where the EPA Administrator determines those changes to be similar to the changes listed
in 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1)(i)-(iv). However, no such proposed changes were submitted by the State as part of its operating
permits program, and part 70 does not allow for the substitution of the State permitting authority's approval for
the Administrator's approval, which is required by 40 CFR 70.7(d)(1)(vi). Therefore, for full part 70 approval,
this defect in AQ#70 section 521.A.6 of the permit regulations must be corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(13), (16), 70.7(h), and 70.8 for permit issuance, renewals, reopenings and revisions,
including public notice, and EPA and affected State review are met by the provisions of AQ#70 sections 519, 531, and
533. AQ#70 section 533.B of the permit regulations requires the applicant, rather than the permitting authority,
to submit the permit applications directly to the Administrator. The notification to affected States will be provided
by the permitting authority within 5 working days of receipt of a complete permit application as required by 40 CFR
part 70. AQ#70 sections 533.C and D and 531.B provide EPA review, objection and affected State notice only for major
sources. The Administrator may, at the time of an operating permits program approval, waive the requirement for affected
State and EPA review for any category of sources other than major sources pursuant to 40 CFR 70.8(a)(2). Pursuant to
40 CFR 70.3(b)(1), the State is, under AQ#70 section 507.A.1, also deferring from the part 70 program at this time,
non-major sources with the exception of acid rain sources and solid waste incineration units required to obtain permits
pursuant to section 129(e) of the Act. This deferral is acceptable under 40 CFR 70.3(b)(1) until the Administrator
completes a rulemaking to determine how the program should be structured for non-major sources and whether any permanent
exemptions in addition to those provided for in 40 CFR 70.3(b)(4) are appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(e) for minor modification procedures are established in AQ#70 section 525. 40 CFR
70.7(e)(2) allows the use of these expedited minor modification procedures for certain types of changes. Among other
limitations, the minor modification procedures may not be used for any changes to ``case-by-case'' determinations.
AQ#70 section 525.A.2 of the permit regulations defines the criteria for minor modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions have been raised concerning whether the 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) provisions prohibiting changes in
``case-by-case'' determinations would apply in the instance of a preconstruction permit in which the permitting
authority, through a minor modification procedure, changes a source-specific control technology requirement
not required under part C or D or section 111 or 112 of the Act, or an emission limitation determination established
on a source-specific basis. The EPA believes the better interpretation of 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) requires that
any requirement imposed on a source-specific basis, such as one in which the permitting authority has discretion
in setting the requirement for the particular source, must be considered to be a ``case-by-case'' determination.
Therefore, the EPA believes that a change involving a source-specific requirement in a preconstruction permit would
be considered a ``case-by-case determination of an emission limitation'' under 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3), ineligible
for processing as a minor permit modification. AQ#70 section 525.A.2.d allows the use of minor modification procedures
for some changes which would be considered ``case-by-case'' emission limits under the interpretation referred
to above. The EPA intends to revise 40 CFR part 70 to make interim approval possible for a State which uses the approach
taken in the Louisiana operating permits program for the ``case-by-case'' restriction. The EPA is also soliciting
comment in the proposal to revise 40 CFR part 70 with regard to whether the criteria in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) should
be interpreted to allow source specific minor preconstruction permit review changes in control technology determinations
or emission limitation determinations to be eligible for minor modification procedures. Should EPA decide in favor
of this interpretation, Louisiana's approach to the ``case-by-case'' restriction would be fully consistent with
40 CFR part 70 without change. If the EPA decides, instead, to adopt its current position described above, the Louisiana
operating permits program would be inconsistent with 40 CFR part 70 requirements, because it allows changes in control
technology determinations and emission limitation determinations among other changes that may fall within the
40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(3) restriction to be processed through the minor modification procedures. Therefore,
as a condition of full part 70 approval, Louisiana would be required to revise these permit regulations to provide
that such changes must be processed as significant modifications, as required by 40 CFR 70.7(e)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 525 requires that the application for a minor modification be submitted to and approved by the permitting
authority prior to making the proposed change at the source. AQ#70 section 525.B.6 states that for any minor modification
pertaining to a change which affects federally enforceable permit terms and conditions at a part 70 source, the terms
of the permit revision shall not be federally enforceable pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 until after the required EPA 45-day
review period has expired or until the EPA has notified the permitting authority that the EPA will not object to final
issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first. If the permitting authority has issued approval of the modification
prior to such time, the terms of the permit revision shall be enforceable by the State upon approval by the permitting
authority consistent with the approved SIP. AQ#70 section 525.B.7 further provides that, if at any time after the
approval by the permitting authority the EPA objects, the permit will be reopened. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(v).
This section of the permit regulations provides time-frames for action on the minor modification applications consistent
with 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(iv). The permit regulations do not provide for group processing of minor modifications for
groups of sources. Since the requirements in 40 CFR part 70 for group processing are not mandatory, this is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 527 addresses the criteria for significant modifications and substantially meets the requirements
of 40 CFR 70.7(e)(4). AQ#70 section 527.A.3, in allowing certain changes that render existing compliance terms irrelevant
to be incorporated through minor modification procedures, appears to refer to changes such as those described in
40 CFR 70.4(b)(14), ``off-permit'' changes. However the language of the permit regulations is unclear and requires
clarification. To remedy this defect, the State should add language clarifying that the modification is one which
would qualify as a change under 40 CFR 70.4(b)(14) because it is not addressed or prohibited by the permit and would
otherwise qualify for treatment as a minor modification under 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions for permit reopenings are addressed in AQ#70 section 529 and are consistent with the requirements of 40
CFR 70.7(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.8(a)(3) requires that each State permitting authority keep for five years such records as the Administrator
may reasonably require to ascertain whether the State program complies with the requirements of the Act and 40 CFR
part 70. 44 L.R.S. section 1 contains a very broad definition of ``public records.'' 44 L.R.S. section 36 requires
the records to be kept for three years unless a longer formal retention schedule has been developed. As a condition
of full part 70 approval, a statutory change will be necessary or a supplemental Attorney General's Opinion will need
to be submitted demonstrating how the current statute ensures that the required records will be kept for at least five
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Permit Content (40 CFR 70.6(a)): The permit content requirements of 40 CFR 70.6(a) are met by the model permit submitted
in Volume III of the State's part 70 submittal. However, 40 CFR 70.4(b)(16) also requires provisions in the State's
program implementing the requirements of 40 CFR 70.6 and 70.7. To meet these part 70 requirements, AQ#70 sections
501.C.5 and 6 speak generally to permit terms and conditions, but do not set out all requirements for each operating
permit. Specifically they do not include a requirement that the permit specify the origin of and reference the authority
for each term or condition, nor do they identify differences in form from the applicable requirements upon which the
terms are based. Other elements required by 40 CFR 70.6 are also not addressed. 40 CFR 70.6(a) includes requirements
for emission limitations, monitoring and recordkeeping, and specifies that the regulation must state that no permit
revision shall be required under any approved economic incentive, marketable permits or similar program. A severability
clause is also required to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge
to any portion of the permit. These elements must be addressed in the permit regulations in order to afford citizens
the opportunity to legally challenge permits. Although some of these elements are contained in the State's model
operating permit, one condition of full part 70 approval will be that the permit regulations be revised to require
that all permit elements of 40 CFR 70.6(a) be included in each permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AQ#70 section 507.H meets the compliance requirements of 40 CFR 70.6(c). General permits as allowed by 40 CFR 70.6(d)
and temporary sources as allowed by 40 CFR 70.6(e) are provided for in AQ#70 sections 513.A and 513.B, respectively.
These sections meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.6(f) provides that the State may allow a provision in the part 70 permit stating that compliance with the conditions
of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirement as of the date of permit issuance provided
certain requirements are met. AQ#70 section 507.I allows a very restricted use of such a ``permit shield.'' If the
permit does not specifically state that a permit shield exists for a specific Federal program, no shield is presumed
to exist. AQ#70 section 507.I requires all permit shields to undergo public notice requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.6(g) contains provisions which state that certain ``emergencies'' may constitute affirmative defenses
to actions for noncompliance. AQ#70 section 507.J provides emergency provisions consistent with those of 40 CFR
70.6(g), using the term ``upset'' rather than ``emergency.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) requires that the State's part 70 submittal contain operational flexibility provisions. AQ#70
section 507.G provides for operational flexibility consistent with 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permit regulations do not include a definition of ``emissions allowable under the permit,'' because the State
interprets the plain meaning of this term to be clear in the context of the permit regulations without further definition.
The EPA agrees that the Louisiana permit regulations taken as a whole adequately define ``emissions allowable under
the permit.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Off-permit (40 CFR 70.4(b)(14) and (70.4(b)(15)): Section 507.F of the permit regulations allows off-permit
changes which meet the requirements and provisions of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(14) and (15).

3. Permit Fee Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fees for criteria air pollutants contained in the fee regulations are below the presumptive minimum; therefore
a detailed fee demonstration was submitted in Volume I of the title V operating permits program submittal. The fee
regulations require a fee of $9.00 per ton for criteria pollutants based on actual emissions at major sources. For
facilities which emit hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), the fees are $25, $50 or $100 per ton based on the class of the
pollutant. These fees, when totaled and divided by the total emissions, result in the collection of approximately
$19 per ton for part 70 sources. After careful review, the State determined that these fees would support the title
V permit program costs as required by 40 CFR 70.9(a). The fee demonstration explains that this fee structure allows
program costs to be covered without unduly penalizing any industry in the State, and the fees generated would meet
the program costs. The fee demonstration is detailed and contains direct and indirect costs as well as the cost for
the implementation of enhanced monitoring, and titles III and IV of the Act. The number of resource-hours and positions
needed to implement the program was calculated and the fees were adjusted to meet these costs. The fee regulations
contain a provision requiring an annual review of the program fee schedule and fee regulations, based on the previous
year's costs of permit program operation. The Louisiana fee demonstration shows that this fee schedule meets the
requirements for an operating permits program in Louisiana. The State will collect $11,000,000 per year to support
all applicable part 70 activities. Total costs to administer the operating permits program are projected to be $10.6
million per year. The State will also increase State air quality staff by 14 positions. Any changes in the fees would
need to be made by a revision to the fee regulations.

4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Louisiana acknowledges that its request for approval of a part 70 program is also a request for approval
of a program for delegation of unchanged section 112 standards under the authority of section 112(l) as they apply
to part 70 sources. Upon receiving approval under section 112(l), the State may receive delegation of any new authority
required by section 112 of the Act through the delegation process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also has the option at any time to request, under section 112(l) of the Act, delegation of section 112 requirements
in the form of State regulations which the State demonstrates are equivalent to the corresponding section 112 provisions
promulgated by the EPA. At this time, the State plans to use the mechanism of incorporation by reference to adopt unchanged
Federal section 112 requirements into its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radionuclide NESHAP is a section 112 regulation and therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State
operating permits program for part 70 sources. There is not yet a Federal definition of ``major'' for radionuclide
sources. Therefore, until a major source definition for radionuclides is promulgated, no source would be a major
section 112 source solely due to its radionuclide emissions. However, a radionuclide source may, in the interim,
be a major source under part 70 for another reason, thus requiring a part 70 permit. The EPA will work with the State in
the development of its radionuclide program to ensure that permits are issued in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(g) of the Act requires that, after the effective date of a permits program under title V, no person may construct,
reconstruct or modify any major source of HAPs unless the State determines that the maximum achievable control technology
emission limitation under section 112(g) will be met. Such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis where
no applicable limitations have been established by the Administrator. During the period from the title V effective
date to the date the State has taken appropriate action to implement the final section 112(g) rule (either adoption
of the unchanged Federal rule or approval of an existing State rule under 112(l)), Louisiana intends to implement
section 112(g) of the Act through the State's preconstruction process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Louisiana commits to appropriately implementing and enforcing the existing and future requirements
of sections 111, 112 and 129 of the Act, and all maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards promulgated
in the future, in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Louisiana developed acid rain permit rules as AQ#70 section 505, which was submitted with the operating
permits program package. The State also submitted standard acid rain permit application forms. These forms will
be revised as updated model forms are provided by the EPA. These rules and permit applications meet the requirements
of the acid rain program.

5. Enforcement Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Louisiana's operating permits program submittal addressed the enforcement requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii)
and 70.4(b)(5) in Volume I which included a signed Memorandum of Understanding between EPA Region 6 and LDEQ. 30 L.R.S.
section 2025.F.1 allows for injunctive relief for violations that are emissions-related, and 30 L.R.S. section
2025.F.2 allows for criminal penalties for violations of emissions limitations, fee and filing requirements, tampering
with a monitoring device, and false statements. 30 L.R.S. section 2025.F.2.c provides that a person shall not be considered
to be in willful or knowing violation of a fee or filing requirement that was not complied with through excusable neglect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Louisiana Attorney General's Opinion has demonstrated that the State's enforcement authority is adequate under
the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, as discussed above.

6. Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Louisiana submitted to the EPA, under a cover letter from the Governor dated November 15, 1993, the State's
operating permits program. The submittal has been reviewed for adequacy under the requirements of 40 CFR part 70.
The results of this review are included in the technical support document. The submittal has adequately addressed
all sixteen (16) elements required for full approval as discussed in part 70, except with regard to the 70.4(b)(16)
requirement to include requirements for all permit conditions in the permit regulations, the requirement that a
permit, or any portion of a permit, may not be held confidential, the requirement that the permit regulations ensure
that no source, or portion of a source which would be defined as major under 40 CFR 70.2 will be exempted from part 70 requirements
because an R &amp; D facility is co-located with a manufacturing facility, the requirement that AQ#70 section 521.A.6
ensure that ``off-permit'' changes are not processed as administrative amendments, the requirement for approval
by the Administrator for any changes similar to those allowed by AQ#70 section 521.A to be processed as administrative
amendments, the requirement that AQ#70 section 527.A.3 be clarified as referring to ``off-permit'' changes, the
requirement that AQ#70 section 507.C.1.b be revised to require that affected sources comply with the deadlines in
AQ#70 section 505.D.2, and the requirement that records be kept for five years, as discussed above. According to EPA's
current interpretation of ``title I modification'' and ``case-by-case determination,'' the Louisiana operating
permits program would also need to be revised for full approval consistent with the Federal interpretation, by making
the definition of ``title I modification'' consistent with the Federal definition, and by requiring that changes
to ``case-by-case'' emission limitation determinations and source-specific control technologies among other
changes must be processed as significant modifications as required by 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(3). However, if, as discussed
above, 40 CFR part 70 is revised to adopt the alternative interpretation of ``title I modification'' and ``case-by-case
determination,'' Louisiana's regulation with regard to these issues would be fully consistent with 40 CFR part 70
without change. Louisiana's operating permits program submittal meets all requirements necessary to receive source
category-limited interim approval of the State operating permits program pursuant to title V, 1990 Amendments and
40 CFR part 70.

B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by Louisiana on November
15, 1993. Interim approvals under section 502(g) of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. As discussed above, the State's regulation regarding R &amp; D facilities
causes the State to lack the authority to ensure that all part 70 sources submit an application in the first year following
interim approval. Therefore, Louisiana will be granted source category-limited interim approval. In order to receive
source category-limited interim approval, Louisiana's operating permits program must substantially meet the
part 70 requirements and demonstrate a compelling reason. The EPA is satisfied that these requirements have been
met. If promulgated, the State must make the changes noted above to receive full approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of these statutory and regulatory revisions and their procedurally correct adoption must be submitted
to the EPA within 18 months of the EPA's approval of the Louisiana operating permits program. This interim approval,
which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to two years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected
from sanctions for failure to have a program, and the EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permits program in
the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval would have full standing with respect to part 70, and
the one-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as
does the three-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable
to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal would not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover,
the EPA's disapproval of the submittal would not impose a new Federal requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Proposed Rulemaking Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, the EPA is proposing interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the State of Louisiana.
The program was submitted by the State to the EPA for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements found in title
V of the Act, and in 40 CFR part 70, which mandate that States develop, and submit to the EPA, programs for issuing operating
permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources with the exception of Indian Lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for title V approval, specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval of a program for delegation of Federal section
112 standards as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate
authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements
under 40 CFR part 70. Therefore, as part of this interim approval, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under
section 112(l)(5) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal
standards as promulgated. This applies to existing and future standards as they apply to sources covered by the part
70 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this submittal of the Louisiana operating permits program and is proposing source category-limited
interim approval. Certain defects in the State's statutes and regulations preclude the EPA from granting full approval
of the State's operating permits program at this time. The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval, subject to the
State obtaining the needed regulatory and statutory revisions within 18 months after the Administrator's approval
of the Louisiana title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4.

The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed interim approval. Copies of the State's submittal and
other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional
Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered
by, the EPA in the development of this proposed interim approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, et seq, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA
may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating permits program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permits program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the
EPA to base its actions concerning operating permits programs on such grounds (

 This is a synopsis of the Commission's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Docket 94&hyph;95, adopted August 12, 1994 and released August 15, 1994. The full text of this decision is available
for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20554, and may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission, in response to a Petition for Rule Making filed by the petitioner, proposed to amend &sect;76.51
of the Rules to add the community of Lakeland to the Tampa-St.Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida television market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In evaluating past requests for hyphenation of a market, the Commission has considered the following factors as
relevant to its examination: (1) the distance between the existing designated communities and the community proposed
to be added to the designation; (2) whether cable carriage, if afforded to the subject station, would extend to areas
beyond its Grade B signal coverage area; (3) the presence of a clear showing of a particularized need by the station
requesting the change of market designation; and (4) an indication of benefit to the public from the proposed change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of these factors helps the Commission to evaluate individual market conditions consistent ``with the underlying
competitive purpose of the market hyphenation rule to delineate areas where stations can and do, both actually and
logically, compete.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Based on the facts presented, the Commission believes that a sufficient case for redesignation of the subject market
has been set forth so that this proposal should be tested through the rule making process, including the comments of
interested parties. It appears from the information before us that the television stations licensed to Tampa, St.
Petersburg, Clearwater, and Lakeland do compete for audiences and advertisers throughout much of the proposed combined
market area, and that sufficient evidence has been presented tending to demonstrate commonality between the proposed
communities to be added to the market designation and the market as a whole. Moreover, the petitioners' proposal appears
to be consistent with the Commission's policies regarding redesignation of a hyphenated television market. Accordingly,
comment is requested on the proposed addition of Lakeland to the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida television
market.

4. The Commission certifies that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rulemaking proceeding
because if the proposed rule amendment is promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities, as defined by &sect;601 (3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A few cable television
system operators will be affected by the proposed rule amendment. The Secretary shall send a copy of this

II. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The restrictions on providing housing assistance to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status have been embodied
in statute since 1980. Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 1637) (Section 214)
was the original basis for restrictions on providing assistance to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status
in the assisted housing programs. Section 214 was amended by section 329(a) of the Housing and Community Development
Amendments of 1981 (94 Stat. 408), by section 121(a)(2) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (``IRCA'',
100 Stat. 3384), and by section 164 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (101 Stat. 1860). (Section
214, as amended by these statutory sections, is codified at 42 U.S.C. 1436a.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been numerous attempts by HUD to implement by regulation the statutory restrictions on providing assistance
to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status. Rules, both proposed and final, were published in 1982 (47 FR
18914, and 47 FR 43674), in 1986 (51 FR 15611), and 1988 (53 FR 842, and 53 FR 41038). Despite the publication of final
rules during the period between 1982 and 1988, the statutory restrictions of section 214 have not been made effective.
A detailed history of the regulatory efforts to implement section 214 (including why the final rules were not made
effective) can be found in the rule published on January 13, 1988 (53 FR 842). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent proposed rule implementing section 214 (before publication of this proposed rule) was published
on October 19, 1988 (53 FR 41038). The proposed rule published in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is based on the October 19, 1988 proposed rule, and takes into consideration public comment received on the October
19, 1988 proposed rule. The discussion of public comments is set forth in section VII of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Procedural Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. No Restrictions on Use of Assistance Until Final Rule Is Published and Effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Until a final rule implementing section 214 is published and made effective, there are no HUD restrictions on the use
of assisted housing by noncitizens with ineligible immigration status. Consequently, until this proposed rule
has reached the final rule stage, covered entities (i.e., housing authorities, managers of HUD-assisted housing,
and mortgagees in the section 235 FHA insurance program) are not authorized to take any action based on the eligible
immigration status of applicants and tenants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Using the ``Effective Date of the Final Rule'' as the Critical Date Rather Than ``Date of Enactment'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of section 214 was added by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (the 1987 Act) and confers
discretion on the Secretary of HUD to continue assistance or defer termination of assistance on behalf of an individual
for whom assistance would otherwise be terminated if that person was ``receiving such assistance on the date of enactment
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``date of enactment'' is also found in section 214(d) in the description of the elderly persons who need not
provide documentation of their immigration status. The statute exempts from such documentation any individual
who is ``62 years of age or older, and is receiving financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1987.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD has determined that the provisions of section 214 are too complex to be determined self-implementing as of the
date of enactment of the 1987 Act (February 5, 1988). Thus, the restrictions of section 214 will not be felt until a final
regulation is published and becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general Congressional intent of section 214(c)(1) was to protect ``the sanctity of the family.'' (See remarks
of Sen. William Armstrong, 133 Cong. Rec. S18615, December 21, 1987.) To honor this intent, HUD believes it is necessary
to implement the new protective provisions at the same time that the restrictions of section 214 become effective.
To do otherwise would be to thwart the pro-family intent of the Congress by prematurely triggering the statute's protections
and rendering them meaningless for families admitted after the enactment date, but before a final rule effectively
applies the restrictions of section 214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other words, since the exact effect on persons applying for or participating in the covered HUD programs will not
be known until publication of the final rule, HUD is interpreting the statutory language to permit lenient treatment
to persons receiving assistance on the effective date of the final rule when all parties affected will have notice
of the methods that HUD has chosen for implementing the statutory restrictions rather than on the precise date of enactment
of the 1987 Act. To limit lenient treatment to persons receiving assistance on the precise date of enactment would
create a category of persons (admitted between February 5, 1988 and the final rule's effective date) who would be denied
the new statutory protections simply because of the time associated with promulgation of a final rule. Support for
this position is found in a House Committee Report in connection with the 1987 Act (H.R. Rep. No. 100&hyph;1222, 100th
Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1987) (``House Report'')). In that report, the Congress stated: ``The modifications [made by
the 1987 Act] are intended to clarify the original intent of Congress that families in which at least one person is eligible
are not disqualified and that the rules not be applied retroactively.'' (House Report at p. 50.)

IV. Reimbursement for Costs of Implementing and Operating Verification System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 214(g) authorizes HUD to reimburse covered entities for the costs incurred in implementing and operating
the system developed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for verifying immigration status. The
INS system is referred to as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements or SAVE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although implementation and operation of the INS verification system is not specifically addressed in this rule,
detailed guidance will be issued to covered entities at the time of publication of the final rule. HUD will be developing
a method of coordinating with the INS for verifying immigration status through SAVE, which includes an automated
system, and a manual search capability. HUD anticipates that the cost of necessary verification inquiries made on
the automated system will be billed directly to HUD.

V. Section 214 Coverage of HUD Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. HUD Programs Covered by Section 214 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) of section 214 states that its restrictions concerning noncitizens with ineligible immigration status
apply to the provision of ``financial assistance made available pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937,
section 235, or 236 of the National Housing Act, or section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Programs Covered by the 1937 Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The programs providing financial assistance on behalf of tenants (or homebuyers) pursuant to the United States Housing
Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (1937 Act) are the Public and Indian Housing programs, the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs, and the
Housing Development Grant programs (with respect to low income units only). All of these programs provide housing,
either directly (such as public housing) or indirectly (such as through Section 8 Certificates), that is assisted
by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Public and Indian Housing Programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Included among the Public and Indian Housing programs are the Mutual Help and Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity
programs. The restrictions against financial assistance to noncitizens with ineligible immigration status are
to be applied to current homebuyers under the Turnkey III and Mutual Help programs only to the extent that applying
the restrictions would be consistent with existing contracts. All homeownership contracts executed after the effective
date of the final rule will be covered by the restrictions. Another homeownership program covered is the HOPE for Public
and Indian Housing Homeownership program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437aaa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs include New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, Moderate
Rehabilitation, Certificate, Voucher, State Housing Agency and Farmers Home Administered, Section 202 Housing
for the Elderly or Handicapped projects (when section 8 assistance is involved), Loan Management and Property Disposition
projects. While the Rental Rehabilitation program also is operated under the 1937 Act (section 17 of the 1937 Act),
it does not provide financial assistance to tenants except to the extent tenants participate in the Section 8 Certificate
or Voucher programs, which are separately covered by the restrictions of section 214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 235 of the NHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program authorized under section 235 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z) (NHA), provides for payments
by HUD to the mortgagee on behalf of a low income mortgagor to reduce the homebuyer's payments to an affordable level,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the higher of a certain percentage of income or the amount that would be payable if the interest charged on the mortgage
loan were set at some figure such as four percent. This program is available to purchasers of single family homes, and
to purchasers of units in cooperatives and condominiums. The rule will affect mainly new applicants for participation
in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance contracts of section 235 homeowners who executed their contracts before the effective date of this rule
will be honored without regard to their citizenship or immigration status. Additionally, mortgagors who refinance
their section 235 mortgages (which were executed before the effective date of the final rule, and whose assistance
contracts were unchanged after that date) with mortgages insured under section 235(r) of the NHA are not subject to
the section 214 requirements. The reason for the latter exemption is that many old 235 mortgages bear an interest rate
higher than 12 percent. If the section 214 requirements (with the required recertifications) are made applicable
to current 235 mortgagors who agree to refinance under section 235(r), this may be a disincentive to refinancing,
and also would be detrimental to HUD. The section 235(r) program is designed to aid HUD in saving millions of dollars
in section 235 assistance payments by refinancing the 235 mortgages at a lower interest rate. Because the 235(r) program
was designed specifically to provide for the refinancing of section 235 mortgages, HUD does not believe that this
is the type of contract modification or program change that triggers the section 214 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule will largely have an impact on current section 235 homeowners themselves only if a homeowner's mortgage is
to be revised for some reason (other than refinancing under section 235(r)), in which case the modification will include
application of the restrictions on immigration status as if the mortgagor were an applicant for participation in
the assistance program. Although there may be no new mortgages insured and assisted under this program, at conveyance
of properties already insured and assisted under the program, purchasers will be required to demonstrate eligibility
in order to be approved for assistance (and thereafter at each annual recertification, to continue to receive assistance).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 236 of the NHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The section 236 program provides for payments to a mortgagee on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed
for occupancy by low income families in order to reduce the owner's payments to the amount that would be payable if the
interest rate on the mortgage loan were set at a figure such as one percent. These lower mortgage payments enable the
owner to charge qualified tenants lower than market rate rents (``basic rents''), although tenants who are not qualified
for the benefits of the program may be charged market rate rents. In addition, rental assistance payments are available
for some units in these projects to enable the rents charged to tenants who cannot afford the ``basic rent'' to be reduced
to an amount based on a percentage of income, similar to the rents charged in the public housing and section 8 programs.
This rule applies to all the tenants of a section 236 project who pay a below market-rate rent. It does not apply to tenants
who pay a market-rate rent. (It should be noted, however, that a market rent tenant would be required to submit evidence
of citizenship or eligible immigration status if he or she subsequently applied for tenant-based assistance.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Section 101/Rent Supplement Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program authorized under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (12 U.S.C. 1701s), is the
Rent Supplement program. Under this program, HUD makes payments to a housing owner that is a private nonprofit entity
or limited dividend entity and whose purchase of the property is financed by a mortgage loan insured under certain
HUD programs, or is financed under a State or local program approved by HUD. These payments are for the benefit of low
income tenants to enable the owner to charge these tenants rents based on a percentage of their incomes, similar to
the rents charged in the public housing and section 8 programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. HUD Programs Not Covered by Section 214 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD-assisted housing programs that are not covered by 42 U.S.C. 1436a, and consequently are not covered by this rule,
are: (1) The section 221(d)(3) and (d)(5) program of interest subsidy for projects with mortgages insured under those
sections of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 17151); (2) the programs developed to serve the homeless (see 42 U.S.C.
11361), except for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation SRO program (24 CFR part 882, subpart H); (3) the HOPE Homeownership
of Multifamily Units program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12871; (4) the HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family
Homes developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12891; (5) the HOME program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12741; (6) the Supportive
Housing for the Elderly program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1701q; and (7) the Supportive Housing for Persons
with Disabilities program developed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 8013. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above listed programs are not covered unless any of these programs is used in conjunction with a covered program,
such as section 8 housing assistance payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Overview of 1994 Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule published in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (the 1994 proposed rule) is substantially similar to the proposed rule published on October 19, 1988 (1988 proposed
rule). In many respects, section 214 allows little discretion on the part of HUD to expand or reduce the statutory provisions
by regulation. As noted above, section 214 is very specific about what HUD programs are covered by the statute. Section
214 is also specific about what categories of noncitizens are eligible to receive HUD financial assistance, the procedures
to be used to verify immigration status, the types of documentation that must be submitted and who must submit this
documentation, the appeal procedures to be provided to persons initially determined to have ineligible status,
and the special assistance to be provided to certain families with members who have eligible status and those who have
ineligible status.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Summary of Principal Provisions of 1994 Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following provides a summary of the principal provisions of the 1994 proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Eligibility for HUD Financial Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Noncitizens eligible for financial assistance are limited to statutory categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncitizen students who are nonimmigrants are excluded from receiving financial assistance in accordance with
section 214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Evidence of Eligible Status (Who Submits What) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For citizens_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A written declaration only. (The proposed rule removes the 1988 proposed rule language concerning suspicion of submission
of false declaration of citizenship.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For noncitizens 62 years of age or older, and receiving HUD assistance on the effective date of the rule_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A written declaration, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proof of age document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all other noncitizens_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A written declaration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A verification consent form, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of immigration status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Election not to declare eligible status. The 1994 proposed rule also contains a provision that permits a member of
a family to elect not to contend that he or she has eligible status (i.e., the person elects not to submit a declaration
of eligible status), and if other members of the family declare eligible status and have eligible status, the family
may be eligible for continued assistance, proration of assistance (see discussion of proration of assistance under
section VI.A.11 of this preamble), or temporary deferral of termination of assistance, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permissible to incorporate declaration in housing application assistance. The 1994 proposed rule does not prescribe
a specific declaration. A responsible entity may provide for the declaration to be incorporated in the application
for assistance, or make it a separate document. The declaration, however, must cite the statutory authority under
which it is required to be provided, and the purpose for the requirement (i.e., that financial assistance is contingent
upon the submission of the form). Additional guidance on implementing the requirements of section 214, that is to
be issued at the time of publication of the final rule, will include model language for the declaration, as well as the
verification consent form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. When to Submit Evidence of Eligible Immigration Status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For applicants, the 1994 proposed rule provides for the responsible entity to require submission of the evidence
by the date the responsible entity anticipates or has knowledge that verification of other aspects of eligibility
for assistance (i.e., income, family composition) will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For persons already receiving assistance, the rule provides for the responsible entity to require submission of
evidence at the first regular reexamination of eligibility (i.e., reexamination of income and family composition)
that occurs after the effective date of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For new occupants in an assisted unit, the rule provides for the responsible entity to require submission of evidence
at the first interim or regular reexamination following the person's occupancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One-time submission for continuous occupancy. The proposed rule clarifies that evidence of eligible status is required
to be submitted only one time for each family member that maintains continuous occupancy in an assisted unit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Extension of Time to Submit Evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
require
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 responsible entities to grant an extension of time in which to submit evidence if the applicant or tenant submits the
declaration of eligible immigration status, and certifies that the evidence needed to support the declaration is
temporarily unavailable, and prompt and diligent efforts to obtain this evidence will be undertaken. The proposed
rule provides that the extension may not be for an indefinite period, but allows for the responsible entity to establish
a time period that is sufficient for the applicant or tenant to obtain the needed evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. When Verification of Eligible Status is to Occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For applicants, the 1994 proposed rule provides for the responsible entity to verify evidence of eligible immigration
status at the time the responsible entity verifies other aspects of eligibility for assistance (i.e., income, family
composition). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For persons already receiving assistance, the rule provides for the responsible entity to verify evidence of eligible
status at the time that it verifies other aspects of eligibility (i.e., reexamination of income, family composition)
for continued occupancy in the assisted unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verification of evidence of eligible immigration status is to be treated the same as any other factor which determines
a family's eligibility for assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Verification Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides for the following verification procedures in accordance with the INS verification systems:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary verification

 is a manual search by the INS of its records to determine an individual's immigration status. If primary verification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 The proposed rule does not provide for waiver of the INS verification procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Protection of Individual's Privacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 214(d)(3) requires HUD to protect the ``individual's privacy to the maximum degree possible.'' The 1988
proposed rule provided that evidence of immigration status submitted by an applicant or tenant to the responsible
entity may be released by the responsible entity to HUD, or to a Federal, State or local agency under specific circumstances,
or may be released by HUD to any Federal, State, or local government agency (including the Social Security Administration
and the INS) under specific circumstances, and listed those circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule recognizes the impossibility of anticipating all circumstances under which a responsible
entity or HUD may be required to release information. Accordingly, the 1994 proposed rule removes the list of circumstances,
and provides that (1) the responsible entity may release the information to HUD and the INS for purposes of determining
eligible immigration status, (2) HUD may release the information to the INS, and (3) the responsible entity and HUD
may release the information to any other Federal, State or local government agency in accordance with applicable
Federal, State or local law that requires the release of the evidence to that agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. No Delay, Denial, Reduction, or Termination of Assistance Pending Verification of Eligible Status or Pending
INS Appeal; but Delay for Applicant Following INS Appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with section 214(d)(4), the 1994 proposed rule provides that assistance to an applicant may not be delayed,
reduced, or denied, and assistance to a tenant may not be delayed, denied, reduced or terminated, during the pendency
of the verification procedures for eligible status, or during the pendency of the INS appeal procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with section 214(d)(5), assistance to an applicant may not be denied, and assistance to a tenant may not
be terminated during the pendency of the informal hearing procedure provided by the responsible entity. However,
section 214(d)(5) only restricts denial or termination of assistance. Thus, assistance to an applicant may be delayed,
but not denied, during the pendency of the informal hearing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Extension of Time to Request INS Appeal or Informal Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 proposed rule requires the responsible entity extend the time for requesting an appeal to the INS or for requesting
an informal hearing upon good cause shown by the applicant or tenant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Continued Assistance/Deferred Termination of Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with section 214, the 1994 proposed rule provides for assistance to be continued or termination of assistance
temporarily deferred for certain families and under certain circumstances as set forth in section 214(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Proration of Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 proposed rule provides for proration of assistance for applicant and tenant families containing family
members with eligible and ineligible immigration status (``mixed families''). The allowance for proration of assistance
departs from HUD's previous position on this issue. HUD previously took the position that proration was not authorized
by section 214, and even if authorized, not feasible in its covered programs, particularly in HUD's public housing
and section 8 programs. On further consideration, HUD acknowledges that the statutory language does not prohibit
proration of assistance, and HUD has designed formulas for proration that it believes will make proration of assistance
possible in covered programs.

HUD specifically requests comment from the public on the proration formulas set forth in &sect;&sect;200.188, 812.11,

12. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional provisions in the 1994 proposed rule (particularly those that differ from the 1988 proposed rule) are
addressed in the discussion of public comments on the 1988 proposed rule set forth in section VII of this preamble.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documents in Other Languages. One additional provision included in the 1994 proposed rule is a requirement that for
any document or notice that the rule requires the responsible entity (housing authority, project owner, mortgagee)
to provide an applicant or tenant or to obtain the signature of the applicant or tenant, the responsible entity, where
feasible, is to provide such document in a language that is understood by the applicant or tenant if he or she is not proficient
in English. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nondiscrimination Requirements. The 1994 proposed rule includes a provision that restricts the responsible entity
from administering the restrictions of section 214 in a manner which discriminates or treats persons differently
because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or familial status, as prohibited by the Fair
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619), Title VI of the Civil Rights of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d&hyph;2000d&hyph;5),
and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). Such unlawful actions include determinations of
eligibility and ineligibility, using different requirements to ascertain that eligibility or ineligibility,
and treating persons differently, if those actions are based on such factors as language, country of origin, or family
associations.

B. Organization of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the number of HUD programs covered by section 214, this proposed rule amends several program regulations
in three chapters of HUD's regulations: 24 CFR Chapter II, Chapter VIII, and Chapter IX. Within these three chapters,
conforming amendments are made to several parts, and four parts are substantially amended to address the restrictions
of section 214. These parts are: parts 200, 812, 905, and 912. The regulations implementing section 214 in each of these
four parts are divided into the following regulatory sections, and generally follow the order shown below.

VII. Response to Public Comments on 1988 Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the preamble discusses the significant issues and questions raised by public comments received on
the 1988 proposed rule. The discussion of public comments on the 1988 proposed rule is included in the preamble to the
1994 proposed rule to assist the public in understanding why certain provisions in the 1988 proposed rule were revised
or not revised in the 1994 proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the public comment period for the 1988 proposed rule, 20 comments were received. These represented the views
of several housing authorities, two State departments of housing, project owners, an association of management
agents, and an association of housing officials, legal services organizations, immigration law organizations,
and an advocacy group for the elderly. Many comments made suggestions criticizing the restrictions for being too
broad, the special relief for being too narrow, or the procedures for giving inadequate opportunity to applicants
to demonstrate eligibility. However, other comments focused on the burden placed on the entity responsible for enforcing
the restrictions and complained that the procedures were too complicated and costly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the comments received during the comment period of the 1988 proposed rule, HUD held an informal meeting
at HUD headquarters in February 1994 on the subject of the restrictions imposed by section 214. This meeting was attended
by representatives of organizations that included, but were not limited to: The Farmers Home Administration, the
Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc., Chicanos for La Causa,
New York Legal Aid Society, National Center for Youth Law, National Council of La Raza, National Housing Law Project,
and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. These organizations submitted additional written comments
at, and subsequent to, the meeting. These comments are part of the docket file for this rule, and are available for inspection
by the public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following provides a discussion of the comments received on the 1988 proposed rule, and notes the changes that
HUD made, and declined to make in the 1994 proposed rule as a result of these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Restrictions To Apply on Effective Date of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in section III.B. of the preamble, the 1994 proposed rule uses, as did the 1988 proposed rule, the phrase
``the effective date of the final rule'' in lieu of the statutory phrase_``date of enactment'' of the 1987 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Eligible Status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Noncitizen Eligibility Limited to Statutory Categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two housing agencies and a legal services organization stated that Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAWs) and Replenishment
Agricultural Workers (RAWs) should be included in the rule's list of noncitizens with eligible immigration status.
These two categories of noncitizens were authorized to be given temporary lawful resident status by IRCA, which also
granted amnesty to noncitizens who had resided illegally in the United States since before January 1, 1982. Although
a later amendment to the HUD statute governing eligible immigration status for these programs (the 1987 Housing Act)
clarified that the latter category of noncitizens have eligible status, it did not refer to the SAWs and RAWs. For this
reason, the 1988 proposed rule did not include SAWs and RAWs as having eligible status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, after reviewing the language of IRCA pertaining to SAWs and RAWs (amending sections 210 and 210A of the Immigration
and Nationality Act), and consulting with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) about the interpretation
to be given sections 210(a)(5) and 210A(d)(4) (8 U.S.C. 1160 and 1161), HUD determined that noncitizens admitted
for temporary or permanent lawful residence under these sections have eligible status, as long as their status has
not expired or changed. In a letter to HUD dated December 17, 1993, the INS noted that as a practical matter, no additional
RAWS were admitted during Federal fiscal years 1990 through 1993, the period in which RAWS could have been admitted,
and stated that no noncitizens ``were or will be admitted as RAWs.'' Consequently, the 1994 proposed rule includes
reference to SAWs, but not RAWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged that HUD add to its list of the categories of eligible noncitizens two categories not expressly
recognized by the statute as having such status: (1) Noncitizens who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United
States for many years and who will become legal permanent residents in the near future, such as relatives of citizens
or permanent residents; and (2) noncitizens who are so elderly, ill, or disabled that the INS will not deport them on
humanitarian grounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD lacks the legal authority to add these categories of individuals to the list of those eligible for admission to
the programs covered by this rule. However, if individuals meeting these descriptions already reside in assisted
housing, they may qualify for continued assistance under the regulatory provisions pertaining to mixed families
if they live with citizens or permanent residents, or for deferral of termination of assistance if they are unable
to locate alternative suitable housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ineligibility of Noncitizen Students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 214 provides that noncitizen students who are not immigrants (i.e., are not seeking to establish residency
in the United States) are not eligible for assistance. The Congress passed the provision concerning nonimmigrant
student noncitizens (sec. 164, Pub. L. 100&hyph;242, 101 Stat. 1861) in the late fall of 1987, directly targeted against
noncitizen students who are nonimmigrant in very emphatic language: ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not make financial assistance available for the benefit of'' a
noncitizen student who is a nonimmigrant. (Emphasis added) HUD lacks the authority to modify this mandate. However,
the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;404, dated October 9, 1992, allows certain persons
who may have been admitted to the United States as noncitizen students who are nonimmigrants to adjust their status
to that of lawful permanent residents of the United States, and thus become eligible noncitizens under this rule.
(See 8 CFR part 245 as amended on July 1, 1993, 58 FR 35832.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD, however, has interpreted the restrictions on assistance to noncitizen students as not applying to the citizen
spouse of a noncitizen student or to the children of the citizen spouse and noncitizen student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Submission of Evidence of Eligible Status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Documentation Requirements_Who Submits What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged HUD to require all applicants and tenants, whether citizens or noncitizens, to submit documentation
establishing eligibility. The commenter insisted that by doing so, HUD would reduce the likelihood of discrimination
by owners, and ensure that applicants do not bypass the verification procedures by simply declaring that they are
citizens. In contrast, another commenter insisted that HUD's requirement that noncitizens and citizens submit
documentation of eligible citizenship or immigration status would only increase the burden on already-busy property
managers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule maintains documentation requirements because documentation requirements are imposed by
statute. However, the 1994 proposed rule revises the documentation requirements for citizens, and for noncitizens
who are or will be 62 years of age or older and are or will be residing in assisted housing when these regulations take
effect. The 1994 proposed rule removes the requirement in the 1988 proposed rule that citizens and noncitizens 62
years of age or older and residing in assisted housing submit a verification consent form. (See section VI.A.2. of
this preamble which describes the documentation required by the 1994 proposed rule.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule does not modify the documentation requirements for all other noncitizens (i.e., those who
are not 62 years of age or older and residing in assisted housing) because these documentation requirements for noncitizens
are statutorily prescribed by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;7). Under
IRCA, every individual who declares him or herself to be a noncitizen with eligible immigration status (except for
certain elderly tenants) must submit immigration documents for verification by the INS. This requirement applies
to every member of a household, including children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD disagrees with the commenter who suggested that requiring all tenants and applicants to submit documentation
of citizenship or immigration status would lessen the likelihood of discrimination by responsible entities. Under
both the 1988 and 1994 proposed rules, a responsible entity is required to ask any individual declaring eligible immigration
status to submit immigration documents for verification with the INS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals who declare in writing that they are United States citizens are not required under IRCA to submit proof
of citizenship. HUD construes this provision to mean that the Congress specifically intended to exempt citizens
from IRCA's document submission and verification procedures, and this statutory construction is reflected in the
1994 proposed rule, as it was in the 1988 proposed rule. (See, also, the discussion between Senators Kennedy and Hawkins
at 131 Cong. Rec. S11414, 11417 (daily ed. September 13, 1985).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation is supported by the language contained in Part A of IRCA. Specifically, section 101 of IRCA (Control
of Unlawful Employment of Aliens) amends the Immigration and Nationality Act by adding a new section 274A (8 U.S.C.
1324a), which provides at section 274A(b) for the establishment of an employment verification system. Under section
274A(b), the Congress specifically required an employer to attest under penalty of perjury that it had verified that
an individual was not an unauthorized noncitizen, and that the verification was based upon a review of certain statutorily
prescribed documents. These documents include, among others, U.S. passports and certificates of U.S. citizenship
or naturalization. This statutory scheme is markedly absent under HUD's provisions under Part C of IRCA (Verification
of Status Under Certain Programs). Accordingly, given the marked absence of these requirements from section 214,
HUD is not imposing a proof of citizenship requirement in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged HUD to exempt persons with disabilities from the rule's ``citizen and noncitizen status documentation
requirements.'' Another commenter asked that the rule exempt from the documentation requirements all persons who
are covered by HUD's definition of ``elderly person,'' which would include non-elderly persons and persons with
disabilities. The commenter suggested that the exemption could be limited to those instances where the individual
actually submitted medical proof of his or her disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documentation requirements under the rule are statutorily mandated under IRCA, and HUD does not have the discretion
to administratively exempt from those requirements a particular group of persons. Moreover, section 621 of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1992 (106 Stat. 3812) (1992 Act), which amended section 3 of the U.S. Housing Act of
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a) (1937 Act), revised the statutory definition of ``elderly person'' to remove the reference
to persons with disabilities and limit this term to persons who are 62 years or older. (Before the amendment, persons
with disabilities were included in the definition of ``elderly person,'' regardless of the age of the disabled person.)
Accordingly, as amended by the 1992 Act a person with disabilities meets the 1937 Act definition of ``elderly person''
if the person is 62 years or older. In light of the amendment made to the definition of ``elderly person'' by the 1992
Act, HUD cannot treat disabled persons who are not 62 years of age or older as if they were elderly persons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important to clarify two related points on this issue. Since any individual who declares, under penalty of perjury,
that he or she is a United States citizen is not required to submit proof of citizenship, no documentation requirements
are imposed upon a person with disabilities (or anyone else) who is a U.S. citizen. Similarly, any person with disabilities
who (1) is a noncitizen, (2) is 62 years of age or older or will be 62 years of age by the time he or she is required to submit
evidence of eligible status, and (3) is receiving HUD assistance on the effective date of this final rule, is exempt
from the rule's requirements to submit evidence of immigration status. This person only would be required to submit,
in addition to the declaration, a proof of age document. As a result, even though there is no specific exemption for
persons with disabilities under this rule, it is still possible that a person with disabilities may not have to submit
immigration status documentation because of the rule's own general exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Persons Other Than Citizens and Certain Elderly Persons Are Not Exempt From Documentation Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter argued that the statutory provision establishing the statutory documentation requirements does
not apply to applicants because section 214(d) requires immigration documents to be submitted by individuals who
are, among other things, ``receiving financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1987.'' (As noted in the discussion under section VII.A. of this preamble, in both the 1988 and 1994
proposed rules, HUD replaces the term ``date of enactment'' of the 1987 Act with ``effective date of final rule.'')

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since applicants for HUD assistance could not have been ``receiving financial assistance on February 5, 1988'' (the
date of enactment of the 1987 Act), the commenter contends that applicants do not need to submit documents verifying
citizenship or eligible immigration status until they actually become recipients. Consequently, this commenter
asked HUD to include in the rule a prohibition against the removal of any applicant's name from a waiting list based
upon a failure to verify immigration status with the INS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD disagrees with this interpretation. The 1987 Act amended section 214 to provide that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If such an individual is not a citizen or national of the United States, is not 62 years of age or older, and is receiving
financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, there must
be presented either *&blank;*&blank;* (alien registration documents or other documents acceptable to HUD). (42
U.S.C. 1436a(d)(2))
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has construed this language to mean that only two classes of individuals are exempt from the immigration documentation
requirements: (1) Those who declare themselves to be U.S. citizens or nationals; and (2) noncitizens who are or will
be 62 years of age by the time they are required to submit immigration documents, and who were receiving HUD financial
assistance on the effective date of this final rule. This second category of persons, however, would be required to
present proof of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter proposes that HUD establish an additional exemption for all applicants to assisted housing. Again,
under this interpretation, the documentation requirements would not be triggered until the applicant becomes a
tenant ``receiving financial assistance.'' HUD believes that there is no legal basis for adopting this interpretation
of the 1987 Act. There is no evidence in the 1987 Act that the documentation requirements of section 214 were intended
to apply only to tenants. To the contrary, the 1987 Act contains other provisions that support that the documentation
requirements were intended to cover applicants as well. (See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(ii) and 1436a(d)(4)(B)(ii),
which prohibit HUD from delaying, denying, reducing or terminating an individual's eligibility for financial assistance
pending INS verification or appeal.)

Clearly, the Congress intended the SAVE system to be used to verify the immigration status of applicants to assisted
housing, and not to delay this process until after the applicant became a tenant receiving HUD assistance. Consequently,
the 1994 proposed rule does not revise the 1988 proposed rule's interpretation of this statutory language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters urged HUD to consider an alternative interpretation concerning the elderly exemption, one which
would exempt from the rule's documentation requirements any individual who not only is 62 years of age or older and
receiving HUD financial assistance on the effective date of the final rule, but an individual who is receiving HUD
financial assistance on the effective date of the final rule, and who will be 62 years of age by the time he or she is required
to submit evidence of eligible status. This revision would provide individuals with a longer period of time in which
to qualify under the elderly exemption. HUD agrees that this is the preferable statutory interpretation, and is consistent
with Congressional intent concerning the protections to be provided to persons already receiving assistance and
elderly persons. Accordingly, the 1994 proposed rule contains this interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter on the ``elderly exemption,'' advocated that the exemption apply to both current tenants of HUD-assisted
housing, and ``to future applicants who are elderly.'' Citing from the House Committee Report on H.R. 4 (H.R. Rep.
No. 100&hyph;122, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1987)), the commenter contended that Congress meant to exclude from
the rule's documentation requirements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 elderly individuals, and not just those who were receiving financial assistance on the effective date of HUD's final
rule. The commenter quoted from page 50 of the House Committee Report: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Elderly persons 62 years or older would only have to certify, and would not have to provide documentation establishing
their immigration status or nationality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While it is true that the House version of the 1987 Act would have extended the elderly exemption to all persons 62 years
of age or older, this language was modified prior to passage of the bill. Under section 164(c)(1) of the 1987 Act, as
passed (101 Stat. 1861), the Congress narrowed the exemption to apply only to an individual who is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;
62 years of age or older, and (who) is receiving financial assistance on the date of the enactment of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1987.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, HUD construes this language to mean that the elderly exemption applies only to individuals who
are or will be 62 years of age by the time they would be required to submit evidence of eligible status, and who are receiving
HUD financial assistance on the effective date of the final rule. Accordingly, HUD has not adopted the suggested modification
in the 1994 proposed rule.

3. Submission of Original Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter argued that elderly persons would be unable to produce original records proving their age in the time
period allowed by the proposed regulations. HUD notes that the 1988 proposed rule did not provide any time limit for
the submission of documents, including documents establishing an individual's age. With regard to the documentation
that is needed to establish an individual's age (i.e., the types of acceptable documents, and whether original documents
must be submitted or whether some alternative procedure is permissible), the 1994 proposed rule does not prescribe
acceptable documentation. Responsible entities will continue to follow existing procedures used in the various
assisted housing programs to document age (i.e., to document that a person is an ``elderly person''). HUD also notes
that most individuals who are 62 years of age or older will have readily available the documents establishing age since
those documents are needed to obtain social security benefits, and other benefits provided by communities (e.g.,
discounts for senior citizens).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters urged HUD to eliminate the requirement in the 1988 proposed rule that applicants and tenants must
submit original immigration documents for verification with the INS. These commenters asserted that the proposed
rule failed to consider the burden this requirement would impose upon individuals who had to surrender their INS documents,
or upon HAs that would have to implement costly procedures to keep track of these documents. As an alternative, these
commenters suggested that individuals be permitted to submit certified copies of INS documents, with original INS
documents required only when the responsible entity has a reasonable suspicion of fraud or misrepresentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD has consulted with the INS about whether certified immigration documents, rather than original INS documents,
are acceptable for SAVE verification. The INS has indicated to HUD that ``*&blank;*&blank;* only originals of documents
denoting immigration status'' may be used to establish eligibility through the SAVE system. Consequently, HUD does
not have the discretion to modify this provision of the rule. However, it should be noted that under no circumstance
should a responsible entity retain in its possession any original INS documents. The responsible entity should review
the original INS document, make photocopies of the document for its own records, and return the original document
to the applicant or tenant as quickly as possible. This restriction on the retention of original INS documents by the
responsible entity is included in the 1994 proposed rule.

4. When Documentation Is To Be Submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters noted that the 1988 proposed rule did not contain time limits for applicants and tenants to submit their
immigration documents. The commenters stated that, to the extent immigration documents must be submitted within
the time period for the general recertification of eligibility process, it would be ``too brief a period.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD agrees with the suggestion that owners and housing authorities (HAs) must provide notice of the time period for
submission of immigration documents. Section VI.A.3 of this preamble describes the time for submission of documents
as provided in the 1994 proposed rule. The 1994 proposed rule also requires owners and HAs to inform applicants and
tenants of this time period in the notice to applicants and tenants that advises them that the provision of financial
assistance or continued financial assistance is contingent upon the submission and verification of immigration
documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter asked that the rule clarify that the responsible entity's notice to tenants and applicants, advising
that financial assistance is contingent upon the submission and verification of immigration documents, be in writing.
HUD intended that this notice be in writing, and the 1994 proposed rule makes this clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked HUD to include in this notice, as well as the notice informing ineligible applicants and
tenants about the denial or termination of assistance, of the existence of, and the procedures for obtaining relief
under, the ``preservation of families'' provision. HUD agrees that both of these notices should inform applicants
and tenants that they may qualify for relief under the preservation of families provision, and indicate the criteria
and procedures for obtaining such relief, and the 1994 proposed rule adopts this requirement for notices.

5. Removal of 1988 ``Reason to Suspect'' Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters expressed concern that the 1988 proposed rule authorized an owner or HA to initiate termination
procedures whenever there is evidence of conflicting or inconsistent information regarding an individual's identity
or claimed citizenship status. Several commenters claimed that the 1988 rule's ``reason to suspect'' provision
invites discrimination against anyone who ``appears foreign,'' and they urged that sanctions be imposed upon responsible
entities that are found to have discriminated on this basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule removes this provision. Any false statement or fraudulent evidence concerning eligibility
on the basis of eligible citizenship or immigration status should be handled in the same manner that an owner or HA addresses
false statements or fraudulent evidence with respect to other aspects of eligibility. To the extent possible, eligible
citizenship or immigration status should be treated the same as other factors that are taken into consideration in
determining a person's eligibility for assistance or continued assistance. Except where mandated by statute (notice
requirements, verification procedures, hearing requirements, special relief provisions), the proposed rule
directs the responsible entity to rely on existing procedures that are in place and applicable to other eligibility
factors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

6. Privacy Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked HUD to revise the provision in the 1988 proposed rule that granted authority to HUD to share with
Federal, State or local government agencies any information that it obtains during the verification process. The
commenter stated that information concerning citizenship or eligible immigration status obtained by HAs and project
owners during the verification process should not be used for any purpose other than to determine eligibility for
assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information contained in the HUD systems of records is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C.
552a). Information gathered by HAs or private owners is not. However, any information gathered by these entities
could be subject to State or local privacy laws. The 1988 proposed rule purported to list all the sources to which the
information could be released and the purposes for which the information could be used. HUD has concluded that a rule
cannot anticipate all the possibilities in which such evidence may be compelled to be released by HUD or the project
owner or HA under applicable law, and the 1994 proposed rule removes the list of circumstances in which evidence of
eligible status may be released. (Section VI.A.7 of this preamble describes how the 1994 proposed rule addresses
this issue.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the privacy issue, HUD has determined that the project owner, like HUD, should bear no obligation to
control what an agency (to which the project owner or HUD was required to release evidence of eligible immigration
status) does with this evidence. Therefore, the 1994 proposed rule provides that neither HUD nor the responsible
entity is responsible for the further use or transmission of the information released in accordance to applicable
law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters mentioned that there is a serious potential for misuse of the INS data base, particularly when
the data base is being accessed by private entities. They suggested that HUD include ``enhanced protections'' in
the rule to safeguard the confidentiality of information obtained from the data base. Similarly, another commenter
urged that authorized names or approval numbers for INS document verification be provided to owners and HAs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the first comment, HUD points out that the INS already has protections built into the SAVE system to maintain
the confidentiality of system information, particularly when information is being accessed by private individuals.
In addition, HUD will provide the INS with the names and approval numbers of project owners or HA representatives who
are authorized to access the SAVE system. The project owners and HA representatives may use information obtained
from the INS and the applicant only in accordance with the verification consent form.

Several commenters advocated recognition of an immigration judge's decision granting a suspension of deportation
as evidence of lawful admission for permanent residence. Their reasoning was that the Form I&hyph;551, which ordinarily
evidences lawful admission for permanent residence, is issued after the decision and backdated to the date of the
decision but may not be available when an applicant or tenant needs to establish eligible immigration status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The INS has informed HUD that the decision of an immigration judge to suspend deportation is not final when issued.
The INS may review such a decision and reverse it. If the INS decides not to reverse the decision, or is unable to act within
the required review period, a Form I&hyph;551 is issued and the decision becomes final. Therefore, while a copy of
the decision itself is not evidence of final INS action conferring eligible status, the Form I&hyph;551 is. The 1994
proposed rule does not include a decision to suspend deportation in the list of acceptable documentation of eligible
immigration status, since it is not evidence of final INS action. However, if an applicant or tenant has only the judge's
order suspending deportation at the time of application or recertification of income, he or she can appeal to the INS
to obtain a final determination of immigration status and a Form I&hyph;551.

The Department of Agriculture contacted HUD about its inclusion of Form I&hyph;688A in the list of documents evidencing
eligible immigration status. Since the housing programs operated by the Department of Agriculture are to follow
the same strictures concerning eligible noncitizens (with the exception of farm workers' housing) as apply to HUD
programs, the inquiry was whether Form I&hyph;688A is evidence of a grant of eligible status under HUD programs, or
whether it is merely evidence that an individual has applied for eligible status. After consulting with the INS, HUD
determined that it is the latter. Therefore, the I&hyph;688A has been removed from the list of documents that evidence
eligible immigration status in the 1994 proposed rule.

In the 1994 proposed rule, other changes were made to the list of immigration documents that appeared in the 1988 proposed
rule. These changes were made in response to a 1993 letter from the INS, which provided information concerning the
current status of various identification documents (i.e., current form numbers, the annotation on cards, etc.),
and HUD will further consult the INS on applicable immigration documents before issuance of the final rule.

One commenter asked HUD to specifically state in the rule that eligibility determinations by HAs may not be relied

determinations as evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters objected to the requirement in the 1988 proposed rule that the responsible entity obtain from
the applicant or tenant either an INS document that contains a photograph, or an additional document with a photograph,
to ensure the alien's identity. These commenters noted that neither IRCA nor the 1987 Housing Act requires an individual
to submit a photograph when the INS document submitted does not contain one.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule requires only the submission of the INS immigration document in whatever form that document
may be in (i.e., whether it contains a photograph or does not contain a photograph).

Three commenters asserted that the 1988 proposed rule would have implemented section 121 of IRCA ``*&blank;*&blank;*
in a manner that violates many of section 121's protections for the public, and without a well-developed plan with
the INS for processing verification requests and for reimbursement.'' The commenters expressed concern that INS
records may be unreliable, verification could take several months and produce erroneous results, and the consequences
would be that eligible persons would have assistance denied or terminated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 proposed rule closely tracks the statutory protections found in 42 U.S.C. 1436a (d)(4)(A)(ii) and (d)(4)(B)(ii).
These statutory sections require HUD to provide a ``reasonable opportunity'' to submit documents, and to appeal
to the INS. The 1994 proposed rule requires that a responsible entity not deny admission to an otherwise eligible applicant
to a covered program solely on the basis of immigration status, when such assistance is available, or terminate assistance
to a tenant, during the ``reasonable opportunity'' to submit immigration documents, or pending the INS verification
process, or the INS appeal. Under this expansive interpretation, an applicant or tenant would not be penalized for
any delay in verifying eligible immigration status, irrespective of the cause for the delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for applicants, the protections against ``delay'' in providing assistance only extend through the INS
appeal process. The statute does not provide protection for an applicant against delay in providing assistance during
the pendency of the informal hearing process. While the statute provides that during the pendency of the informal
hearing process, assistance may not be denied or terminated (42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(6)(D)), the statute drops reference
to ``delay.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters noted that the proposed rule failed to establish a timetable for owners to submit documents to the
INS for verification. They contended that delays in the submission of immigration documents to the INS could jeopardize
a person's eligibility for assistance or continued assistance, and thereby violate the statutory mandate that assistance
not be delayed, denied, or terminated as a result of the verification process. These commenters urged HUD to include
in the rule a timetable for the submission and processing of documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule adopts this suggestion although protections provided by 42 U.S.C. 1436a (d)(4)(A)(ii) and
(d)(4)(B)(ii), as discussed above and incorporated in the rule, renders the issue largely moot. As discussed above,
a responsible entity must admit an otherwise eligible applicant to an available unit during the period provided to
submit immigration documents, or pending the INS verification, or INS appeal process. Thus, even if an owner delays
the submission to the INS of an applicant's immigration documents, the delay will not affect the applicant's ability
to obtain assistance if the applicant is otherwise eligible, and if assistance is available. Nevertheless, the 1994
proposed rule requires that a responsible entity submit to the INS no later than 10 days following the date of submission
copies of immigration documents that it obtains from applicants and tenants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD has refrained from establishing a specific time period for processing immigration documents, because this can
vary greatly depending upon the circumstances. However, for the same reasons discussed above, the failure to establish
a processing deadline will not affect a person's eligibility for assistance or continued assistance if the person
is otherwise eligible for assistance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked whether secondary verification would have to be instituted whenever the primary verification
process is unable to confirm eligible immigration status, including instances where the primary system verifies
ineligible status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance to an applicant or tenant may never be denied or terminated solely on the basis of the primary verification
system's determination of ineligibility. The 1994 proposed rule provides that a responsible entity must institute
secondary verification whenever primary verification is either unable to confirm eligible status, or when it verifies
ineligible immigration status. The only instance in which primary verification would be used without the benefit
of secondary verification is when the primary system verifies eligible immigration status.

A number of commenters asserted that the 1988 proposed rule improperly characterized the INS secondary verification
process as an appeal. They cited the General Accounting Office's October 1987 Report on SAVE, in which the INS stated
that ``no denial of benefits may be based solely on primary verification.'' These commenters contend that secondary
verification is not an appeal, but a necessary step because of inadequacies of the INS primary verification system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has consulted with the INS concerning IRCA's reference to an appeals process, and the INS agrees with the commenters
that secondary verification may not substitute for the appeals process under 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(i). Further,
the INS confirmed that secondary verification is a necessary step to the denial or termination of assistance to an
individual, and that the INS appeals process cannot be initiated until after secondary verification establishes
that the individual is not an eligible alien. The 1994 proposed rule therefore removes the reference to an ``appeal''
that accompanied the ``secondary verification'' heading in the applicable regulatory sections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 proposed rule includes a discussion of the procedures for initiating the INS appeal once secondary verification
establishes ineligible status. Under these procedures, the responsible entity must notify the applicant or tenant
of the INS determination of ineligibility, and of the individual's right to appeal to the INS the verification decision,
to submit additional documentation or a written explanation in support of the appeal, or to request an informal hearing.
The responsible entity must submit photocopies of these documents to the appropriate INS district director, together
with a copy of INS Form G&hyph;845S (used to process the secondary verification request) and a cover letter identifying
the package as an appeal of the INS determination of ineligibility. The INS will issue a decision on the appeal within
30 days from the date of 
<!-- PJG 0172 columnbreak -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
its receipt of the documents. If the INS is unable to respond within this time period, it will notify the applicant or
tenant and indicate the reasons for the delay. Pending the outcome of the INS appeal, an otherwise eligible applicant
must be provided with housing assistance, if such assistance is available, and assistance to a tenant may not be interrupted.

6. The SAVE System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters claimed that the 1988 proposed rule's provisions on the SAVE verification procedures seemed premature,
since it appeared that the necessary coordination with the INS had not yet been completed. They asked HUD to make clear
that a rule would not take effect until the SAVE process is fully operational. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD has been working closely with the INS to implement the SAVE system for its covered programs, and fully expects to
have all of the necessary coordination completed before the effective date of a final rule implementing section 214.
In addition, HUD plans a delayed effective date for its final rule. The delay will provide for a period that is sufficient
for project owners and HAs to undergo training on the SAVE system and become proficient in its use. As a result, HUD fully
expects all necessary coordination with the INS on the use of the SAVE system to be completed before the effective date
of the final rule implementing section 214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters claimed that the 1988 proposed rule failed to provide the detailed information necessary to implement
SAVE such as how requests for verification would be transmitted to the INS, who would bear responsibility for lost
INS documents, or what line item of the ``statement of profit or loss'' in HUD Form 92410 should include the relevant
administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures for the SAVE system are established by the INS, and HUD is required to use these procedures. Therefore,
elaboration of the SAVE procedures is not a matter to be established by HUD through rulemaking. The INS has a handbook
governing the procedure, and HUD will develop supplementary instructions that will assist responsible entities
in following the SAVE procedures. HUD expects to issue detailed guidance well in advance of the effective date of a
final rule.

F. Reasonable Opportunity to Establish Eligible Status_No Denial or Termination of Assistance during Reasonable
Opportunity Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters strongly objected to HUD's interpretation in the 1988 proposed rule of 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(ii)
and (d)(4)(B)(ii). These statutory sections state that HUD must provide individuals with ``a reasonable opportunity''
to submit immigration documents for verification with the INS, and that pending this period HUD may not ``delay, deny,
reduce, or terminate (an) individual's eligibility for financial assistance on the basis of the individual's immigration
status.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1988 proposed rule, HUD maintained that so long as the responsible entity continued to process an applicant
for purposes of establishing eligibility for financial assistance, and placed the applicant's name on a waiting
list once eligibility (aside from eligible immigration status) was established, it was complying with the requirements
of IRCA. HUD reasoned that under this procedure the applicant's ``eligibility for financial assistance'' would
not be delayed pending the secondary verification, even though assistance would not actually be provided until eligible
immigration status was verified with the INS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters argued that delaying assistance because of immigration verification violates IRCA's prohibition
against delaying assistance during the reasonable opportunity to submit immigration documents, or pending the
INS verification or INS appeal. They further claimed that the distinction drawn by HUD in the preamble to the 1988 proposed
rule between delaying eligibility and delaying financial assistance violates IRCA as soon as an applicant reaches
the top of the waiting list. The commenters instead advocated admitting applicants based upon their written declarations
of eligibility, and later evicting them if secondary verification establishes that the tenant is an ineligible alien.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed under section VII.E.3 of this preamble, HUD has reconsidered its interpretation of 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(ii)
and (d)(4)(B)(ii). The 1994 proposed rule provides that an otherwise eligible applicant must be admitted to a housing
assistance program, if such assistance is available, during the reasonable opportunity to submit immigration documents,
pending the INS primary or secondary verification of immigration status, or pending the conclusions of the INS appeal
process. Again, however, as discussed earlier in this preamble, the statute does not provide identical protection
to an applicant during the informal hearing process. Although assistance may not be denied pending the conclusion
of the informal hearing process, assistance to an applicant may be delayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to tenants, the 1994 proposed rule provides assistance may not be terminated during the reasonable opportunity
to submit immigration documents, pending the INS primary or secondary verification, or pending the conclusion of
the INS appeal process, or pending the conclusion of the informal hearing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Proration of Assistance Permitted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters disagreed with HUD's analysis in the preamble to the 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 41046&hyph;47)
that IRCA's prohibitions against delaying, denying, reducing or terminating assistance pending verification
also preclude the proration of assistance (i.e., permitting a family with ineligible family members to continue
to receive assistance, based only on the eligible members). The commenters insisted that this language was intended
solely to protect individuals against the loss of benefits during INS verification of immigration status, and should
not be used by HUD to prohibit the proration of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this preamble, HUD has revised its position on the issue of proration of assistance. HUD agrees
with the commenters that the statutory language is insufficient to support the prohibition of proration of assistance.
The 1994 proposed rule provides for proration of assistance for applicants and tenants. Again, HUD specifically
requests comment on the issue of proration of assistance, on the formulas for prorating assistance as set forth in
the proposed rule, and welcomes suggestions and recommendations on how these formulas could be improved or made simpler.

H. Changing Units or Housing Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked HUD to revise the provision in the 1988 proposed rule that would require a responsible entity to
verify a tenant's immigration status as a condition of transferring from one unit to another, or from one housing assistance
program to another. The commenter stated that there may be instances in which the tenant family has to transfer through
no fault of its own during the term of the lease, and HAs should have the discretion to continue assistance under such
circumstances for a minimum of one year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD agrees that a tenant who transfers from one unit to another within the same housing project should not be required
to verify eligible immigration status since that tenant would be merely seeking to continue an existing subsidy,
and the 1994 proposed rule adopts this change. In the case of public housing, even a transfer from one project to another
would be continuation of the existing subsidy and therefore not involve an ``admission,'' which would require verification
of eligible immigration status, unless the move was from the jurisdiction of one HA to another HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to transfers from one subsidy program to another or from one housing project to another, immigration status
is verified when HUD regulations require that the tenant be treated like any other applicant attempting to receive
a new form of housing assistance. HUD's position is not dependent upon whether the change is voluntary or involuntary,
but rather if the change renders the tenant a new applicant under HUD's regulations. For example, if a family moved
from one section 236 project to another, the move would be considered a new admission, because each project is separately
owned and operated and the family would be required to satisfy admission criteria of the management of the project
to which it was moving. Therefore, the family would be asked to submit information about citizenship or eligible immigration
status along with income eligibility information.

I. Hearings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Administrative Burden
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter claimed that the hearing requirements contained in the 1988 proposed rule would place a tremendous
administrative burden upon HAs, and would result in overloading its existing hearing officers with potentially
``hundreds of ineligible alien determinations.'' The commenter maintained that this would delay proceedings against
truly undesirable residents, such as those involved in drug transactions. Another commenter suggested that HAs
should respond to the increased administrative burden by delaying the ineligibility determination hearings until
more serious cases are heard, or by developing some other priority system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD believes that these commenters have overestimated the number of hearings that will be requested by persons as
a result of ineligibility determinations under this rule. As noted earlier in this preamble, HUD believes that the
majority of applicants and tenants will be citizens and assert citizenship. Additionally, HUD expects that it is
unlikely that a noncitizen who has been confirmed by the INS verification system and appeals process to be ineligible
for assistance will go to the trouble of requesting a hearing to contest the final INS decision. Consequently, HUD
expects the administrative burden imposed upon HAs and project owners as a result of providing these hearings to be
minimal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD believes that the hearing process provided under the 1988 proposed rule was legally sufficient, and complied
with the requirements of the 1987 Act. The 1988 proposed rule met the minimum statutory requirements for a hearing.
Under 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(6), HUD is required to make available to an individual who has been determined to be an ineligible
noncitizen ``*&blank;*&blank;* the applicable fair hearing process.'' The section lists the minimum statutory
criteria needed to comport with due process requirements, which include: (1) Written notice of the determination
to deny or terminate benefits, and of the opportunity for a hearing to discuss the determination; (2) a hearing before
an impartial hearing officer; and (3) written notification by the responsible entity of the decision of the hearing
officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule adds certain other due process components to the informal hearing process. These additional
components are those provided by HAs and project owners for termination of tenancy (e.g., see 24 CFR 905.340, and 24
CFR 966.56). HUD believes that the type of hearing provided for termination of tenancy also should be available to
applicants who are denied assistance on the basis of ineligible immigration status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Timeframes for Requesting Hearings and Issuing Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters objected to the 1988 proposed rule's 14-day period for requesting a hearing, claiming that the period
is too brief since it would run from the date on the notice, and not from the date of receipt. They urged HUD instead to
grant a hearing whenever reasonable cause is shown for a belated hearing request, or whenever there is only nominal
prejudice to the responsible entity. Another commenter asked HUD to extend the period for requesting a hearing from
14 to 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While HUD has not entirely adopted either of these suggestions in the 1994 proposed rule, the 1994 proposed rule provides
that a hearing must be requested within 14 days of the date of mailing the written notice of ineligibility or the INS
appeals decisions (established by the date of postmark) or the date of personal delivery of the notice (established
by date of actual delivery) to the applicant or tenant. In addition, the 1994 proposed rule requires the responsible
entity to grant an extension for requesting a hearing upon good cause shown by the applicant or tenant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters objected to the requirement that responsible entities must provide an applicant or tenant with
a written final decision regarding the decision to deny or terminate benefits within five days of the informal hearing.
They claimed that this five-day limit does not provide a responsible entity with sufficient time to investigate and
verify additional documentation that may have been submitted by the applicant or tenant at the hearing. HUD agrees
with these commenters, and the 1994 proposed rule provides that the responsible entity must provide its written decision
within 14 days of the hearing date.

4. Hearing Officers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed concern about the qualifications of hearing officers under the 1988 proposed rule.
The commenters cited the United States Supreme Court's decisions in

424 U.S. 319 (1976) in support of their claims that the requirements for hearing offices contained in the 1988 proposed
rule are constitutionally deficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, a number of commenters asserted that under the standards established in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
McClure, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a project owner who wants his or her employee to qualify as a hearing officer must first ensure that the employee has
knowledge of the SAVE program, immigration law, and relevant program information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD disagrees with this interpretation of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
McClure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
case. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
McClure, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Supreme Court focused on the second of the three factors cited in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Matthews, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which considers the risk of an erroneous decision and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute due process
safeguards. The Court then noted that in that case the Department of Health and Human Services by regulation required
its carriers to select as a hearing officer:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[A]n attorney or other qualified individual with the ability to conduct formal hearings and with a general understanding
of medical matters and terminology. The hearing officer must have a thorough knowledge of the Medicare program and
the statutory authority and regulations upon which it is based, as well as rulings, policy statements, and general
instructions pertinent to the Medicare Bureau.'' (Id. at 1188).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Supreme Court found that because the HHS regulation ensured the qualifications of hearing officers, the record
did not support the appellee's claims that additional due process safeguards would reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation
of benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, it is inaccurate to point to the HHS regulatory standards on the qualification of Medicaid hearing officers
as establishing the minimum constitutional standards needed to comply with due process. Moreover, contrary to the
suggestion of commenters, it is unnecessary for HUD to require under its rule implementing section 214 that hearing
officers have substantive knowledge of immigration law. The INS has undisputed expertise in this area, and under
the rule any applicant or tenant who is faced with the denial or termination of benefits because of ineligible immigration
status is guaranteed an opportunity to directly appeal to the INS the ineligibility determination. As a result, it
would be duplicative and unnecessary to require hearing officers to have in-depth knowledge of immigration law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters contended that the regulatory sections in the 1988 proposed rule which permitted a hearing to be held
before an officer or employee of the owner so long as he or she did not make the initial decision of ineligibility, violates
the 1987 Act's requirement of an impartial hearing officer. Another commenter claimed that the informal hearing
established in the 1988 proposed rule failed to satisfy statutory and constitutional requirements, since both the
initial decision and the decision following the hearing are issued by the owner, and not the owner's designated representative.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD disagrees with these comments. Both the 1988 and 1994 proposed rules provide that an individual who has received
a letter denying or terminating assistance may request an informal hearing at which he or she can meet with any person
designated by the owner *&blank;*&blank;* other than a person who made or approved the decision under review, or other
than a person who is a subordinate of the person who made or approved the decision under review. HUD believes that this
language comports with due process requirements for impartiality and, as a result, the provision remains unchanged
in the 1994 proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that the rule provide for hearing officers to be bilingual, or to provide the applicant
or tenant with interpreters when circumstances require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule does not require hearing officers to be bilingual. With respect to interpreters, the 1994 proposed
rule provides that an applicant or tenant is entitled to have an interpreter present at the denial or termination hearing,
at his or her own expense, or at the owner's expense, as may be agreed upon by the parties. The owner may already have in
his employ a person who speaks the language of the applicant or tenant, and is willing to have this person serve as an
interpreter. Alternatively, the applicant or tenant may prefer to select their own interpreter.

5. Record of Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters claimed that it was essential to the fair hearing procedure that the responsible entity maintain a
record of the hearing for judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The informal hearing process does not require that a record be generated and maintained, and HUD declines to impose
such requirement in this rule. The 1994 proposed rule provides for the responsible entity to allow an audiotape of
the hearing, but no transcript is required to be made that would meet court standards and facilitate judicial review.
In addition, and in accordance with HUD practice in the administration of many of its programs, the 1994 proposed rule
requires that documents used by the responsible entity in processing an application or verification of eligibility
of a tenant be maintained for a period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Notices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters requested that the notice of denial or termination of assistance include a brief statement
of the reasons for the denial or termination, and an explanation of any documents found to be missing or inadequate.
In addition, four commenters asked that the rule be revised to require the responsible entity to inform applicants
and tenants not only of the right to obtain a hearing, but also of the procedures for initiating the hearing and the INS
appeal. HUD agrees with both of these suggestions and has adopted these changes in the 1994 proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters asked that all notices issued under the rule to applicants and tenants be required to be bilingual
or multilingual, as necessary. As discussed in section VI.A.12 of this preamble, the 1994 proposed rule imposes a
duty on the responsible entity to provide, where feasible, documents or notices in a language that is understood by
the applicant or tenant if the applicant or tenant is not proficient in English. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Removal of Resumption of Assistance and Retention of Assistance Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters claimed that HUD's position on the resumption of assistance to tenants after required evidence is
submitted is unduly harsh. The commenters referred to the preamble of the 1988 proposed rule, in which HUD stated that
after financial assistance for a tenant is terminated, assistance would not resume unless all of the required evidence
was submitted by the tenant to the owner, ``*&blank;*&blank;* and resumption of assistance is authorized in accordance
with HUD requirements.'' (HUD indicated in the 1988 proposed rule that these requirements would be described in greater
detail in program handbooks.) The commenters maintained that assistance should always be restored to an eligible
family when necessary to prevent homelessness, or when a delay in the submission of documentation is caused by circumstances
beyond the control of the tenant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that resuming assistance to a family after assistance has been terminated can be programmatically
burdensome, since HA units are typically fully leased and there are waiting lists. This commenter urged HUD to provide
HAs, in advance of the implementation of the final rule, with the handbook requirements on the resumption of assistance
so that necessary procedures can be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter objected to HUD's statement in the preamble of the rule that program handbooks would contain the
requirements governing resumption of assistance. The commenter claimed that these requirements should be published
in the final rule and not in a program handbook. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On further consideration of this issue, HUD has determined that once assistance to a tenant has been terminated for
ineligible immigration status, the tenant should be treated the same as if the assistance were terminated for any
other reason. No special procedure needs to be developed for purposes of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the 1988 regulatory provision concerning ``Retention of Financial Assistance'' has been removed. This
provision prohibited a responsible entity from receiving or retaining financial assistance paid for the benefit
of a tenant admitted for participation in a program when required evidence of eligible status has not been submitted
or verified by the INS in accordance with the regulations. This prohibition applies whether a responsible entity
admitted a person who has ineligible immigration status, or who is ineligible on some other basis (e.g., the person's
income makes them ineligible for assistance).

L. Extensions; Requirement to Grant Upon Good Cause; and Grant or Denial to be in Writing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous comments were received on the 1988 proposed rule's provisions on the extension of time for tenants to submit
immigration documents. (See section VII.F of this preamble concerning reasonable opportunity to submit documents
of eligible status by both applicants and tenants.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that while the 1988 proposed rule permitted a tenant under certain circumstances to obtain an
extension of time for the submission of immigration documents, the 1988 rule failed to consider the financial burden
this requirement imposes upon HAs. In order to implement this provision, the commenter claimed that housing authorities
would have to develop systems to record extensions, and to monitor tenant compliance, and the rule should provide
reimbursement for these expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While HUD agrees that recording tenant extensions and monitoring compliance may impose a certain financial cost
to responsible entities, HUD believes that this cost will be minimal. Again, HUD believes that most tenants will have
eligible status, and tenants who are eligible for assistance will not need to request an extension of time to submit
immigration documents, but will have the documents readily available. As discussed under section VII.F of this preamble,
the 1994 proposed rule provides that an extension be granted to applicants and tenants upon good cause shown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter argued that in the 1988 proposed rule HUD unfairly required a responsible entity to document in writing
the decision to grant an extension, but failed to impose a similar requirement on the decision to deny an extension.
The commenter claimed that the same standards that apply to the decision to grant an extension should also apply to
the denial of an extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule provides for the granting or denial of an extension to be in writing, and if the extension is denied,
to state the reasons for the denial.

1. Proration of Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preservation of families provision in the 1994 proposed rule includes proration of assistance, as discussed
earlier in this preamble. Proration of assistance is available to a mixed family (a family with members with eligible
citizenship/immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status), other than a family receiving
continued assistance or other than a family for which termination of assistance is temporarily deferred.

(A) Permit the continued provision of financial assistance, if necessary to avoid the division of a family in which
the head of household or spouse is a citizen of the United States, a national of the United States, or an alien resident
of the United States described in [section 1436a(a)(1)&hyph;(6)]. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``family''
means a head of household, any spouse, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, and any children
of the head of household or spouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Defer the termination of financial assistance, if necessary to permit the orderly transition of the individual
and any family members involved to other affordable housing. Any deferral under this subparagraph shall be for a 6-month
period and may be renewed by the public housing agency or other entity involved for an aggregate period of 3 years. At
the beginning of each deferral period, the public housing agency or other entity involved shall inform the individual
and the family members of their ineligibility for financial assistance and offer them other assistance in finding
other affordable housing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to continued assistance, these provisions require a project owner (including a mortgagee) to consider
permitting a family to continue to receive assistance in either of two situations. If the head of household or spouse
is a citizen or national, or has eligible immigration status, and continued assistance is necessary to avoid division
of the family, the assistance is to be continued indefinitely.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deferral of termination of assistance is available to a mixed family that qualifies for prorated assistance (and
does not qualify for continued assistance) but decides not to accept prorated assistance, and the responsible entity
allows the family time to find other suitable housing. If granted, the deferral period shall be for an initial period
of six months. The deferral may be renewed for additional periods so long as the total period does not exceed three years.

3. Eligibility for These Forms of Relief
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the language of the statute would only have afforded relief to families receiving assistance on February
5, 1988, the 1994 proposed rule provides, as did the 1988 proposed rule, that such relief will be afforded to families
receiving assistance at the time the restrictions on immigration status are imposed. Since the restrictions are
not imposed until the effective date of the final rule, the 1994 proposed rule uses the effective date of the final rule
as the critical date for eligibility for these forms of special relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decision to Provide Continued Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Project owner discretion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters objected to the discretion given project owners under the 1988 proposed rule to determine whether
a family containing at least one ineligible person could continue to receive assistance. They stated that the statute
authorizes HUD to exercise this discretion, not a private owner. The commenters expressed concern that private owners
would abuse this discretion, resulting in increased evictions, divisions of families, and homelessness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule provides that if the qualifying conditions are found to exist, the project owner must provide
continued assistance to a family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters objected to the provision of the 1988 proposed rule that permitted project owners to deny special
relief to a tenant who is receiving ``only minimal financial assistance'' if the project owner determines that the
tenant could afford to continue occupancy without assistance. The commenters stated that this provision is not authorized
by the statute, and that decisions about minimal assistance and affordability are subjective and must be made by the
tenant rather than the project owner. The 1994 proposed rule does not contain this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. HA Discretion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Similar to the concern expressed about the likelihood of a project owner not granting continued assistance when the
qualifying conditions are satisfied, was the concern expressed by three commenters that the 1988 proposed rule authorized
HAs to not even consider whether to provide continued assistance to tenants in occupancy. These commenters stated
that implicit in the statutory authority given to HAs to grant this type of relief to families is the duty to consider
it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the statutory language with respect to programs administered by project owners, which gives the discretion
to provide special relief to HUD, the language applicable to HAs grants the discretion directly to the HAs. The 1994
proposed rule requires HAs to establish a policy and the criteria to be followed in determining whether to grant a family
this type of assistance. The rule notes that the statute establishes certain criteria applicable to continued assistance
and this criteria must be included in the HA's policy guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Persons Eligible for Continued Assistance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters took issue with the limit on the type of family to whom continued assistance is made available.
The statute, however, prescribes the definition of the ``family group'' that is to be preserved: Head of household,
any spouse, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, and any children of the head of household
or spouse. The list has been carefully drawn to include not only common children of the head of household and spouse
but also any other children either of them may have. Other relatives not having the prescribed relationship to the
head of household or spouse (such as an aunt or uncle) who may have been living in the household and who have eligible
status may be just as integral members of the family, but the Congress has not included them in the list of persons to
be protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Deferral of Termination of Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Discretion to Provide this Type of Relief.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute permits HUD (in the case of project owners) or the HA to defer termination of assistance in certain circumstances.
For project owners, the 1994 proposed rule requires project owners to grant this type of relief if a family meets the
qualifying conditions. For HAs, the 1994 proposed rule permits HAs to determine whether this type of relief will be
provided, but requires the HA, in establishing its standards, to be guided by the standards set forth in the rule implementing
Section 214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Length of the Deferral Period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute also requires that the length of time of any deferral must be six months. The statute provides that deferrals
may be renewed to total as long as 36 months. Commenters objected to the 1988 proposed rule's provisions that merely
restated these periods. One commenter stated that 36 months exceeded a reasonable period, arguing in favor of a six
month limit, and that a long deferral period unfairly diverts Federal housing assistance from eligible applicants.
The other objector stated that an HA should have the discretion to renew deferrals for 12-month periods, to coincide
with the annual recertification date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 proposed rule, similar to the 1988 proposed rule, provides, consistent with Section 214, for the possibility
of allowing subsequent deferrals and that these deferral periods may aggregate to as long a time as 36 months. Each
deferral is to be based on an examination of the ability of the family to find alternative housing. Since some housing
markets are very tight, HUD believes that owners should have the flexibility permitted by the statute to allow families
already occupying assisted housing to remain until they are able to locate other suitable housing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raised the issue of whether deferral of termination of assistance would be available to persons with
ineligible immigration status. The commenters appeared to believe that to obtain such relief, the ``family'' must
have children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temporary deferral of termination of assistance is not limited to families with children. An ineligible individual
residing in Federally assisted housing could qualify for a deferral of termination of assistance if the individual
could demonstrate that reasonable attempts to locate other suitable housing were unsuccessful. Recognizing that
barrier-free housing suitable for mobility-impaired individuals is not readily available in the private market,
it is likely that such an individual could make the necessary showing. (More permanent relief, in the form of continuation
of assistance, might also be possible for a disabled person who is a member of a multi-person family that meets the special
family definition, e.g., a family consisting of a disabled undocumented alien and a citizen spouse.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1988 proposed rule provided that, with respect to a tenant whose termination of assistance has been deferred once,
an owner must make a determination of the availability of affordable housing and a decision about whether to extend
the deferral of termination of assistance in sufficient time that the tenant can be notified at least 60 days before
the expiration of the deferral period of whether termination will be deferred again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters stated that this notice: (1) Must be given in writing at least 60 days before the expiration of the deferral
period; (2) must be given in accordance with formal notice procedures (stating the reasons for any decision not to
extend the deferral period, which must be based on relevant factors); and (3) must include an offer of a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD agrees that adequate notice must be given before the expiration of the deferral in all cases, and the 1994 proposed
rule adopts this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Availability of Alternative Housing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the deferral of termination of assistance provisions, what is important to an ineligible tenant is the type
of evidence necessary to demonstrate that ``reasonable efforts'' have been made to find ``affordable housing''
of ``appropriate size''. Several commenters wanted HUD to provide specific guidelines for these terms to assure
that decisions are not arbitrary. Commenter suggestions with respect to ``affordable housing'' were that this term
must refer to housing for which the rent does not exceed that amount that would be paid in accordance with section 3(a)
of the 1937 Act for a unit in the public housing program, and housing that is required to meet HUD's Section 8 Housing
Quality Standards. Another commenter suggested that this term should refer to housing located in the same community
as that in which the tenant is currently residing, and that ``appropriate size'' be established with reference to
HUD housing programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If ``affordable housing'' and ``appropriate size'' of unit were defined as suggested by the commenters, it is likely
that the only housing that would satisfy the test would be HUD-assisted housing. In many markets, housing assisted
by HUD under the 1937 Act is the only resource available to poor families that meets those specifications, and, therefore,
the test of the availability of other affordable housing would have little meaning. Consequently, HUD declines to
define the ``affordable housing'' alternative in the terms suggested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, HUD agrees that some guidance on the subject is needed, and the 1994 proposed rule provides guidance. The
rule provides that other affordable housing refers to housing that is not substandard, that is of appropriate size
for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family pays for rent, including
utilities, plus 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
N. Protection From Liability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter noted that although the 1988 proposed rule protected from liability both project owners and mortgagees
who comply with the rule's verification requirements, only mortgagees are affirmatively sanctioned under the rule
for noncompliance with the verification procedures. (See &sect;235.13(g) of 1988 proposed rule, and &sect;235.13(d)
of 1994 proposed rule.) The commenter asked HUD to extend similar sanctions under part 200 to all project owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD has reviewed ``invalid certification'' language applicable to mortgagees, and notes that under that provision,
a mortgagee in the section 235 program who falsely certifies to HUD that it has verified a mortgagor's citizenship
or immigration documents, must repay to HUD the full amount of assistance payments made on behalf of the mortgagor.
The provision also prohibits any additional assistance payments from being made on the mortgagor's behalf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that while the 1988 proposed rule provides HAs with flexibility in implementation, it also increases
their potential liability, and asked that the rule be revised to reduce this exposure. Another commenter asked that
HAs be indemnified for any wrongful determinations of eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD has not adopted either of these suggestions, since responsible entities that follow the statutory verification
and due process requirements are protected from liability under both the 1987 Act and IRCA. Under section 1436a(e)
(added by IRCA), HUD is prohibited from taking:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against an entity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
with respect to any error in the entity's determination to make an individual eligible for financial assistance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on citizenship or immigration status *&blank;*&blank;* (if such eligibility is based upon the responsible
entity's complying with the verification and other procedural due process requirements mandated under IRCA.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
And, section 1436a(f)(1), added by the 1987 Act, provides that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no agency or official of a State or local government shall have any liability
for the design or implementation of the Federal verification system *&blank;*&blank;* if the implementation by
the State or local agency or official is in accordance with Federal rules and regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because a responsible entity that follows the verification and due process requirements established in the final
rule is statutorily protected from liability, HUD has not revised the requirements in the 1994 proposed rule to include
any additional protections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
O. Reexamination of Income
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters argued that the requirement for annual verification of the immigration status of any tenant family
containing one or more non-citizen members is an unnecessary burden for project owners, HAs, and tenants. The commenters
that immigration status rarely changes, and that any additional burden encountered because of an applicant's lack
of citizenship might result in discrimination by project owners against all noncitizens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD agrees that the burden of requiring an annual recertification and verification of immigration status of all noncitizen
members of tenant families outweighs any benefit to be obtained, and the 1994 proposed rule revises the reexamination
provisions to restrict the requirement for submission of a declaration (and documentation and verification of immigration
status, where an alien is involved) to new individuals joining the household_other than by birth to one of the occupants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
P. Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Cost
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the commenters on the 1988 proposed rule complained that the requirement that the immigration status of
all applicants be documented and verified under these procedures which include the offer of hearings at several points
would be expensive and time-consuming. One commenter estimated that it would need to hire 56 additional housing assistants,
at a cost of $2 million, as well as conduct training of its employees, at a cost of $250,000, and spend $800,000 on notifying
applicants of the requirements. Several HA commenters suggested that HUD reimburse them for additional staff time.
Another commenter speculated that some landlords would withdraw from participation in HUD programs rather than
put up with the extra burdens and costs of the new requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is aware that the verification procedure prescribed by IRCA is not without cost. The Federal government will incur
the cost of the computerized verification system (SAVE) operated by the INS. The cost of operating that system will
not be billed to the HA or project owner accessing the system but to HUD, for each inquiry made to the system. For HAs and
project owners in most areas of the country, the cost of the verification system will not be substantial, because most
applicants and tenants will certify that they are citizens. For HAs and project owners located in the parts of the country
where the concentration of noncitizen residents is greatest, there will be greater impact. However, the additional
cost will be only a small, incremental change in the overall cost of processing applications and reexaminations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One small HA advocated that HUD at least provide grants to small HAs who must computerize to accomplish the required
verification. HUD sees no reason that any HA would need to computerize in order to implement these requirements. All
that is necessary to access the SAVE system is a touch-tone telephone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Implementation Timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAs indicated that the rule should not be implemented until the INS verification program is fully operational and
readily available for their use. As stated earlier in this preamble, HUD is in full agreement with that desire. The
SAVE system is operational. Funds have been budgeted for billing the cost of SAVE access for HUD programs to HUD. After
the publication of the final rule, arrangements will be made to issue identifying codes to the many administrators
of HUD-assisted housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Other Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of the sections in the 1994 proposed rule have been revised and restructured for ease of understanding and
clarity of complex provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1994 proposed rule, HUD has changed the minimum retention period for documents from 3 years to 5 years. This makes
the retention period coincide with the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution and the ongoing needs for
computer matching to verify tenant income. The five-year retention requirement does not impose a burden on HAs and
private project owners, because HAs and project owners currently retain the records concerning the initial certification,
regular recertification and interim recertification for at least five years.

VIII. Other Matters

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 as a significant
regulatory action. Any changes made in this proposed rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket
file for this proposed rule, which is available for public inspection in the Office of HUD's Rules Docket Clerk, Room
10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.

Environmental Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24
CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The
Finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket
Clerk at the above address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication, and by approving it, certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. HUD believes that the rule, when implemented, will have only a minimal impact
on small housing project owners, small mortgagees and small housing agencies, since the procedures specified to
implement the restrictions are to require owners and HAs to use an easily accessible (by telephone) automated system
for verifying immigration status. HUD has arranged for the cost of the automated verification system, established
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be billed directly to HUD. The only other significant element of
cost or delay in administration of HUD programs that may be encountered by small entities as a result of this rule is
the requirement for a fair hearing, on request, for any applicant or tenant found to be ineligible. This procedure
is specifically required by 42 U.S.C. 1436a. However, HUD does not believe that the cost or delay will be significant
because HUD anticipates that small housing agencies, project owners and mortgagees will find that the majority of
applicants or tenants are eligible to receive HUD assistance, and therefore fair hearings to determine eligibility
on the basis of immigration status will be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, HUD concludes that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities, and that to the extent possible, HUD has minimized the economic impact on all entities, consistent with
the Secretary's responsibilities under section 1436a.

Executive Order on Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. This proposed rule addresses immigration, a topic
exclusively the province of the Federal government, and the effect is the direct result of the statute that imposes
the restriction against assistance to noncitizens, rather than a result of HUD's exercise of discretion in promulgating
a rule to implement the statute.

Executive Order on The Family

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the
provisions of this proposed rule, while affecting the composition and well-being of families, are strictly the result
of the statute that imposes the restriction. The only families upon whom the statute and the rule have an impact are
those containing individuals with ineligible immigration status who are not receiving the benefit of assisted housing,
or whose continued receipt of assisted housing is not necessary in order to avoid the division of the family. However,
even for families that contain members with ineligible status, the rule strives to maintain the unity of the family
under the regulatory provisions concerning special assistance to mixed families.

If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides
not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family shall
be eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time
for the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved,
to other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family
from a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is
not substandard, that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the end of each deferral period, the project owner must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on the vacancy rate for
affordable housing of appropriate size in the housing market for the area in which the project is located, the CHAS
(if applicable), the owner's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence of the tenant
family's efforts to locate such housing. (Affordable housing will be determined to be available if the vacancy rate
is five percent or greater, or if the CHAS (if applicable), the owner's knowledge and the tenant's evidence indicate
that other affordable housing is available) and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that
termination will be deferred again (provided that the granting of another deferral will not result in aggregate deferral
periods that exceed three years), and a determination was made that other affordable housing is not available; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that

Proration under Section 235 Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the household participates in the Section 235 Program, the interest reduction payments paid on the household's
behalf shall be the payments the household would otherwise be entitled to, multiplied by a fraction the denominator

families are to be provided one of the three forms of assistance for preservation of the family. HUD is exercising its
discretion by specifying the standards in this section under which a project owner must provide one of the three types
of assistance described in paragraph (a) of this section to a family.

. With respect to an HA acting as a contract administrator of a certificate (including project-based certificate),

to determine the circumstances under which a family will be offered one of these forms of assistance. The HA must establish
its own policy and criteria to follow in making its decision. In establishing the criteria for granting continued
assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance, the HA must incorporate the statutory criteria,
which are set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

Eligibility for this type of assistance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides
not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be
eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for
the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to
other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from
a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard,
that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family
pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.

 For Section 8 assistance other than assistance provided under the Section 8 Voucher Program, the HA shall prorate
the family's assistance as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Determine gross rent for the unit. (Gross rent is contract rent plus any allowance for tenant paid utilities).

Step 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Determine the amount of the pre-proration voucher housing assistance payment in accordance with 24 CFR 887.353.
(Annual income includes income of all family members, including any family member who has not established eligible
immigration status.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Multiply the amount determined in Step 1 by a fraction for which:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of &sect;&sect;812.10 and 812.11, permitting continued assistance, prorated assistance or temporary
deferral of termination of assistance for certain families, do not apply to any person who is determined to be a noncitizen
student, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or the family of the noncitizen student, as described in paragraph

 For purposes of this part, a noncitizen student is defined as a noncitizen who: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Has a residence in a foreign country that the person has no intention of abandoning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is admitted to the United States temporarily and solely for purposes of pursuing such a course of study at an established
institution of learning or other recognized place of study in the United States, particularly designated by such
person and approved by the Attorney General after consultation with the Department of Education of the United States,
which institution or place of study shall have agreed to report to the Attorney General the termination of attendance
of each nonimmigrant student (and if any such institution of learning or place of study fails to make such reports promptly
the approval shall be withdrawn).

 The prohibition on providing assistance to a noncitizen student as described in paragraph (a) of this section also
extends to the noncitizen spouse of the noncitizen student and minor children of any noncitizen student if the spouse
or children are accompanying the student or following to join such student. The prohibition on providing assistance
to a noncitizen student does not extend to the citizen spouse of the noncitizen student and the children of the citizen
spouse and noncitizen student.

 HUD will not take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against a responsible entity
with respect to any error in its determination of eligibility for financial assistance based on citizenship or immigration
status:

(1) If the responsible entity established eligibility based upon verification of eligible immigration status through
the verification system described in &sect;812.8;

(2) Because the responsible entity was required to provide an opportunity for the family to submit evidence in accordance
with &sect;812.6; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Because the responsible entity was required to wait for completion of INS verification of immigration status
in accordance with &sect;812.8; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Because the responsible entity was required to wait for completion of the INS appeal process provided in accordance
with &sect;812.9(e); or

Where a family has received the benefit of HUD financial assistance to which it was not entitled because the family
intentionally misrepresented eligible status, the ineligible family is responsible for reimbursing HUD for the
assistance improperly paid. If the amount of the assistance is substantial, the responsible entity is encouraged
to refer the case to the HUD Regional Inspector General's office for further investigation. Possible criminal prosecution
may follow based on the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001 and 1010).

composition and follow the procedures required by 24 CFR part 912 for determining citizenship or eligible immigration
status before initial occupancy. Thereafter, for the purposes stated above and to determine whether a Homebuyer
is required to purchase the home under &sect;904.104(h)(1), the LHA shall reexamine the Homebuyer's income and composition
regularly, at least once every 12 months, and shall undertake such further determination and verification of citizenship
or eligible immigration status as required by 24 CFR part 912. The Homebuyer shall comply with the LHA's policy regarding
required interim reporting of changes in the family's income and composition. If the LHA receives information from
the family or other source concerning a change in the family income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled
reexaminations, the LHA, upon consultation with the family and verification of the information (in accordance with
24 CFR parts 912 and 913 of this chapter) shall promptly make any adjustments determined to be appropriate in the Homebuyer
payment amount or take appropriate action concerning the addition of a family member who is not a citizen with eligible
immigration status. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the
Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent must be verified.

Eligibility for this type of assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides
not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be
eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for
the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to
other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from
a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard,
that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family
pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.

(A) Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on evidence of conditions
which when taken together will demonstrate an inadequate supply of affordable housing for the area in which the project
is located, the CHAS (if applicable; CHAS refers to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy described
in 24 CFR part 91), the IHA's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence of the tenant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section applies to a mixed family other than a family receiving continued assistance under paragraph (r)(2)
of this section, or other than a family for which termination of assistance is temporarily deferred under paragraph
(r)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method of prorating assistance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall prorate the family's assistance by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Determining total tenant payment in accordance with &sect;905.325 (annual income includes income of all family
members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subtracting the total tenant payment from a HUD-supplied ``Indian housing maximum rent'' applicable to the unit
or the housing authority. (``Indian housing maximum rent'' shall be determined by HUD using the 95th percentile rent
for the housing authority.) The result is the maximum subsidy for which the family could qualify if all members were
eligible (``family maximum subsidy''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dividing the family maximum subsidy by the number of persons in the family (all persons) to determine the maximum subsidy
per each family member who has citizenship or eligible immigration status (``eligible family member'). The subsidy
per eligible family member is the ``member maximum subsidy''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiplying the member maximum subsidy by the number of family members who have citizenship or eligible immigration
status (``eligible family members''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product of steps 1&hyph;4, as set forth in paragraph (s)(2) of this section is the amount of subsidy for which the
family is eligible (``eligible subsidy''). The family's rent is the ``public housing maximum rent'' minus the amount
of the eligible subsidy.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this section permitting continued assistance, prorated assistance or temporary deferral of termination
of assistance for certain families, do not apply to any person who is determined to be a noncitizen student, as defined
in paragraph (t)(2) of this section, or the family of the noncitizen student, as described in paragraph (t)(3) of this
section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncitizen student. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this part, a noncitizen student is defined as a noncitizen who: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has a residence in a foreign country that the person has no intention of abandoning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is admitted to the United States temporarily and solely for purposes of pursuing such a course of study at an established
institution of learning or other recognized place of study in the United States, particularly designated by such
person and approved by the Attorney General after consultation with the Department of Education of the United States,
which institution or place of study shall have agreed to report to the Attorney General the termination of attendance
of each nonimmigrant student (and if any such institution of learning or place of study fails to make such reports promptly
the approval shall be withdrawn). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Family of noncitizen student. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prohibition on providing assistance to a noncitizen student as described in paragraph (t)(1) of this section
also extends to the noncitizen spouse of the noncitizen student and minor children of any noncitizen student if the
spouse or children are accompanying the student or following to join such student. The prohibition on providing assistance
to a noncitizen student does not extend to the citizen spouse of the noncitizen student and the children of the citizen
spouse and noncitizen student.

HUD will not take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against an IHA with respect to
any error in its determination of eligibility for assistance based on citizenship or immigration status: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the IHA established eligibility based upon verification of eligible immigration status through the verification
system described in paragraph (l) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Because the IHA was required to provide an opportunity for the applicant or family to submit evidence in accordance
with paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Because the IHA was required to wait for completion of INS verification of immigration status in accordance
with paragraph (l) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Because the IHA was required to wait for completion of the INS appeal process provided in accordance with paragraph
(n) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of the immigration status of any new family member. The family shall comply with the IHA's policy regarding required
interim reporting of changes in the family's income and composition. If the IHA is informed of a change in the family
income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the IHA, upon consultation with the

Eligibility for this type of assistance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides
not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be
eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for
the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to
other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from
a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard,
that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family
pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on evidence of conditions
which when taken together will demonstrate an inadequate supply of affordable housing for the area in which the project
is located, the CHAS (if applicable), the PHA's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence
of the tenant family's efforts to locate such housing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that
termination will be deferred again (provided that the granting of another deferral will not result in aggregate deferral
periods that exceed three years), and a determination was made that other affordable housing is not available; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that
termination of financial assistance will not be deferred because either granting another deferral will result in
aggregate deferral periods that exceed three years, or a determination has been made that other affordable housing
is available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Determining total tenant payment in accordance with 24 CFR 913.107(a) (annual income includes income of all family
members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subtracting the total tenant payment from a HUD-supplied ``public housing maximum rent'' applicable to the unit
or the housing authority. (Public housing maximum rent shall be determined by HUD using the 95th percentile rent for
the housing authority.) The result is the maximum subsidy for which the family could qualify if all members were eligible
(``family maximum subsidy'').

Step 3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dividing the family maximum subsidy by the number of persons in the family (all persons) to determine the maximum subsidy
per each family member who has citizenship or eligible immigration status (``eligible family member''). The subsidy
per eligible family member is the ``member maximum subsidy.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Step 4.

 The product of steps 1&hyph;4, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is the amount of subsidy for which the
family is eligible (``eligible subsidy''). The family's rent is the ``public housing maximum rent'' minus the amount
of the eligible subsidy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of &sect;&sect;912.10 and 912.11, permitting continued assistance, prorated assistance or temporary
deferral of termination of assistance for certain families, do not apply to any person who is determined to be a noncitizen
student, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or the family of the noncitizen student, as described in paragraph

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncitizen student.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this part, a noncitizen student is defined as a noncitizen who: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Has a residence in a foreign country that the person has no intention of abandoning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is admitted to the United States temporarily and solely for purposes of pursuing such a course of study at an established
institution of learning or other recognized place of study in the United States, particularly designated by such
person and approved by the Attorney General after consultation with the Department of Education of the United States,
which institution or place of study shall have agreed to report to the Attorney General the termination of attendance
of each nonimmigrant student (and if any such institution of learning or place of study fails to make such reports promptly
the approval shall be withdrawn).

 The prohibition on providing assistance to a noncitizen student as described in paragraph (a) of this section also
extends to the noncitizen spouse of the noncitizen student and minor children of any noncitizen student if the spouse
or children are accompanying the student or following to join such student. The prohibition on providing assistance
to a noncitizen student does not extend to the citizen spouse of the noncitizen student and the children of the citizen
spouse and noncitizen student.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Clean Air Act directs EPA to promulgate regulations specifying those provisions of the Act for which it is appropriate
to treat Indian Tribes in the same manner as States. For those provisions specified, a Tribe may develop and implement
one or more of its own air quality programs under the Act. This proposed rule sets forth the CAA provisions for which
it is appropriate to treat Indian Tribes in the same manner as States, establishes the requirements that Indian Tribes
must meet if they choose to seek such treatment, and provides for awards of Federal financial assistance to Tribes.
EPA requests public comments on all aspects of today's proposal.

A. Development of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice describes proposed regulatory changes to implement section 301(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42
U.S.C. 7401, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(the ``Act'' or ``CAA''). Section 301(d) requires EPA to promulgate regulations that provide for Indian Tribes,
if they so choose, to assume responsibility for the development and implementation of CAA programs on lands within
the exterior boundaries of their reservations or other areas within their jurisdiction. This Tribal authority will
apply to all CAA programs which the EPA Administrator determines to be appropriate in taking final action on this proposal.
An Indian Tribe that takes responsibility for a CAA program under this rule would essentially be treated in the same
way as a State would be treated for that program, with any exceptions noted in this rule and discussed below in this preamble.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Federal/EPA Indian Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing this proposed rule, EPA has acted on the principles expressed in existing Federal policy statements
regarding Indian Tribes. On January 24, 1983, the President issued a Federal Indian Policy stressing two related
themes: (1) that the Federal government will pursue the principle of Indian ``self-government'' and (2) that it will
work directly with Tribal governments on a ``government-to-government'' basis. Presidential support was reaffirmed
in an April 1, 1993 statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 8, 1984, in response to the 1983 Federal statement, EPA adopted a policy statement and implementing guidance
addressing the administration of EPA environmental programs on Indian reservations. EPA's policy is ``to give special
consideration to Tribal interests in making Agency policy, and to ensure the close involvement of Tribal Governments
in making decisions and managing environmental programs affecting reservation lands.'' EPA committed to pursue
certain principles to meet this objective, including the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes Tribal Governments as sovereign entities with primary authority and responsibility for the reservation
populace. Accordingly, EPA will work directly with Tribal Governments as the independent authority for reservation
affairs, and not as political subdivisions of States or other governmental units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the principle of Indian self-government, the Agency will view Tribal Governments as the appropriate
non-Federal parties for making decisions and carrying out program responsibilities affecting Indian reservations,
their environments, and the health and welfare of the reservation populace. Just as EPA's deliberations and activities
have traditionally involved the interests and/or participation of State Governments, EPA will look directly to
Tribal Governments to play this lead role for matters affecting reservation environments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Consultation With Tribal Representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, EPA has consulted with Tribal representatives in developing this proposed rule. EPA discussed preliminary
issues associated with the proposed rule at the ``First National Tribal Conference on Environmental Management''
held in Cherokee, North Carolina in May 1992 and the ``Second National Tribal Conference on Environmental Management''
in Cherokee held in May 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Fall of 1992, EPA met with Tribal representatives at three outreach meetings in Chicago, Denver and San Francisco.
These meetings included a discussion of issues raised by this proposed rule as well as EPA's efforts to assist Tribes
in obtaining training in air quality management. Overall, representatives of approximately 70 different Tribes
attended. In September 1993, EPA discussed a draft of this proposed rule with representatives of approximately 40
Tribes at a seminar sponsored by EPA and the Office of Native American Programs at Northern Arizona University and
a subsequent meeting with representatives of State and local governments sponsored by the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators/Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials. EPA has also consulted
with Tribal and State representatives periodically throughout the development of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received comments both during and following the Tribal and State outreach meetings. EPA has considered these
comments in developing today's proposed rule. To the extent any such commenters have concerns that have not been adequately
addressed by today's proposal, they should submit formal written comments to EPA in response to today's action. Any
such comments must be received by the deadline indicated at the outset of today's notice and submitted to the EPA address
specified above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General Structure of the CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to fully understand this proposal, a basic understanding of the structure of the CAA and its division of responsibilities
between EPA and the States is necessary. Such a description is set forth below. In addition, a brief description of
some of the many programs contained in the CAA is set forth in Addendum A, as an introduction and guidance to Tribes wishing
to develop their own CAA programs. Reading Addendum A in conjunction with today's proposed action will also facilitate
the reader's understanding of the discussion that follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA is implemented in two basic ways. The principal method is through a cooperative partnership between the States
and EPA. While this partnership can take several shapes, generally EPA issues national standards or Federal requirements
and the States assume primary responsibility for implementing these requirements. However, as a prerequisite to
assuming implementation responsibility, States must submit their programs to EPA and must demonstrate that their
programs meet minimum Federal CAA requirements. Among these requirements is the mandate that States demonstrate
that they have adequate legal authority and resources to implement the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State program is approved or if the authority to implement a Federal program is delegated to a State, EPA maintains
an ongoing oversight role to ensure that the program is adequately enforced and implemented and to provide technical
and policy assistance. An important aspect of EPA's oversight role is that EPA retains legal authority to bring an
enforcement action against a source violating a CAA program implemented by the States. Thus, if a State fails to adequately
enforce CAA requirements, EPA can step in and ensure that they are followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example of this cooperative Federal/State arrangement is provided by Title V of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7661&hyph;7661e,
which contains requirements for an operating permit program. Generally, the program requires that certain sources
of air pollution obtain permits which contain all of the requirements under the Act applicable to such sources. EPA
has issued rules specifying the minimum requirements for State permit programs. 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992). States
are required to develop programs consistent with minimum Federal requirements and to submit those programs to EPA
for approval. In those instances when State programs are approved by EPA, the approved States will be primarily responsible
for implementing these provisions of the CAA. EPA will maintain an active oversight role to provide necessary assistance
and to ensure that the EPA-approved State programs continue to be implemented consistent with minimum Federal requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the second, less common form of CAA implementation, EPA is primarily responsible both for setting standards or
interpreting the requirements of the Act and for implementing the Federal requirements that are established. Under
this approach, the Act provides little formal role for States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, this approach is reserved for programs requiring a high degree of uniformity in their implementation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 States nevertheless often actively participate in federal rulemakings and policy development even if the CAA does
not call for primary implementation by the States. EPA similarly encourages Tribes to participate actively in EPA's
rulemakings and policy development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title VI of the Act, which provides for the phase-out of certain substances that deplete stratospheric ozone, is one
such program, since it affects products sold throughout interstate commerce. 42 U.S.C. 7671&hyph;7671q. Title
VI is both a Federally established and Federally managed program. EPA is charged with issuing the rules to implement
the phase-out. Through, for example, reporting requirements and enforcement, EPA also ensures that the restrictions
in production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances that are called for by the Act are, in fact, met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301(d)(2) of the Act authorizes EPA to issue regulations specifying those provisions of the Act ``for which
it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States.'' 42 U.S.C. section 7601(d)(2). Thus, the CAA programs where States
have a formal implementation role will be the programs that are directly affected by today's proposed action. Conversely,
those programs that are established and implemented primarily by EPA will largely be unaffected by today's proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Description of Section 301(d) of the CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301(d)(1) of the CAA authorizes EPA to ``treat Indian tribes as States'' under the Act, so that Tribes may develop
and implement CAA programs in the same manner as States within Tribal reservations or in other areas subject to Tribal
jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For a Tribe to be eligible for such treatment it must be Federally recognized (see section 302(r)) and must meet the
three criteria set forth in section 301(d)(2)(A)&hyph;(C). Briefly, these criteria consist of: (1) a showing of
an adequate governing body; (2) that is capable of implementing the particular requirements of the CAA and applicable
regulations for which the Tribe is seeking program approval; and (3) within the exterior boundaries of the reservation
or other areas within the Tribe's jurisdiction. The precise criteria are set forth in today's proposed rule and are
described in detail in Part III.A. below, together with EPA's proposal as to how this eligibility determination should
be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 For convenience of expression, portions of this rule refer only to Tribal programs within reservations. However,
these references should not be interpreted to limit Tribal programs solely to lands within reservation boundaries
since the CAA acknowledges that tribes may possess authority over off-reservation lands.'' See Part II.A, below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the Act recognizes that it may not be appropriate or feasible in all instances to treat Tribes and States
identically. Accordingly, EPA is required under section 301(d)(2) of the Act to promulgate regulations ``specifying
those provisions of [the CAA] for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States.'' Tribes that satisfy the
criteria discussed above are eligible to implement those provisions specified by EPA if the minimum Federal requirements
set out in the provisions have been met. In general, EPA is proposing that Tribes be eligible to implement the same provisions
as States, with some exceptions, as set forth in today's proposed rule and discussed in Part III.B. below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 301(d)(3) of the Act gives EPA the discretion to promulgate regulations establishing the elements
of Tribal implementation plans (``TIPs'') and procedures for approval or disapproval of those plans or portions
thereof. See Addendum A, ``Title I'' discussion. These regulations would be implemented in conjunction with section
110(o) of the Act, which provides that any TIP that is submitted to EPA under section 301(d) shall be reviewed in accordance
with the provisions for review of State implementation plans (``SIPs'') set out in section 110, except as otherwise
provided by this regulation. Once effective, the TIP would be applicable to all areas located within the exterior
boundaries of the reservation. See section 110(o). In today's action, EPA is proposing TIP regulations and procedures,
as well as procedures for the review of other Tribal air programs (``TAPs''). These procedures are discussed further
in Part III.C. below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 301(d) of the Act makes provision for EPA to furnish grant and contract assistance to Tribes. See
section 301(d)(1), (5) of the CAA. The grant provisions proposed today are described in Part IV of this preamble.

 492 U.S. 408, 426&hyph;28 (1989) (White, J., for four Justice plurality). Such a delegation or grant of authority
can provide a Federal statutory source of Tribal authority over designated areas, whether or not the Tribe's inherent
authority would extend to all such areas. It is EPA's proposed interpretation of the CAA that the Act grants, to Tribes
approved by EPA to administer CAA programs in the same manner as States, authority over all air resources within the
exterior boundaries of a reservation for such programs. This grant of authority by Congress would enable such Tribes
to address conduct on all lands, including non-Indian owned fee lands, within the exterior boundaries of a reservation.
Thus, this proposed interpretation relates to the potential scope of regulatory jurisdiction that may be exercised
by eligible Tribes under EPA-approved Tribal Clean Air Act programs (hereafter ``approved'' Tribes).

 Even without this proposed direct grant of authority, Indian Tribes would very likely have inherent authority over
all activities within reservation boundaries that are subject to CAA regulation. The high mobility of air pollutants,
resulting area-wide effects, and the seriousness of such impacts, would all tend to support Tribal inherent authority;
as noted below, these factors also underscore the desirability of cohesive air quality management of all air pollution
sources within reservation boundaries including those air pollution-related activities on fee lands within reservation
boundaries.

EPA's proposed position that the CAA constitutes a statutory grant of jurisdictional authority to Tribes is consistent
with the language of the Act, which authorizes EPA to treat a Tribe as a State for the regulation of ``air resources 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within the exterior boundaries of the reservation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 301(d)(2)(B) (emphasis added). EPA believes that this statutory provision, viewed within the overall framework
of the CAA, reflects a territorial view of Tribal jurisdiction and authorizes a Tribal role for all air resources within
the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations without distinguishing among various categories of on-reservation
land. EPA believes a territorial approach to air quality regulation best advances rational, sound air quality management.
Air pollutants disperse over areas several and sometimes even hundreds of miles from their source of origin, as dictated
by the physical and chemical properties of the pollutants at issue and the prevailing winds and other meteorological
conditions. The high mobility of air pollutants, resulting areawide effects and the seriousness of such impacts,
underscores the undesirability of fragmented air quality management within reservations.

 As indicated above, EPA interprets the second clause of this provision as meaning that Tribes may also assert jurisdiction
over air resources that are not within the boundaries of their reservations. However, EPA has not interpreted this
clause as a direct grant of jurisdictional authority to Tribes with respect to such off-reservation air resources.
Rather, where a Tribe submits a program asserting jurisdiction over air resources outside the boundaries of a reservation,
EPA will require a demonstration of the factual and legal basis for the Tribe's inherent authority over such resources,
consistent with relevant principles of Federal Indian law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, language contained in two other provisions of the CAA, which expressly recognizes Tribal authority over
all areas within the exterior boundaries of the reservation provides particularly compelling evidence that Congress
intended to adopt this territorial approach. One such provision is in the CAA program governing the amount of incremental
air quality deterioration allowed in ``clean air'' areas. Section 164(c) of the CAA provides that ``[l]ands within
the exterior boundaries of reservations of federally recognized Indian Tribes may be redesignated [with regard
to the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality] only by the appropriate Indian governing body.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 110(o) of the CAA provides that upon approval by EPA, Tribal Implementation Plans (TIPs) ``shall
become applicable to all areas *&blank;*&blank;* located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, notwithstanding
the issuance of any patent and including rights-of-way running through the reservation.'' Section 110(o) of the
Act recognizes that approved Tribes will exercise authority over all areas within the exterior boundaries of a reservation
for purposes of TIPs. TIPs, in turn, are the administrative tools for implementing the requirements under Title I
of the CAA necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS),
one of the central CAA programs. Significant regulatory entanglement and inefficiencies could result if Tribes
have jurisdiction over such plans pursuant to section 110(o) of the Act, but are not found to have jurisdiction within
reservation boundaries over non-TIP CAA programs. For example, a stationary source located on an area of a reservation
over which the Tribe was found to lack inherent authority would be subject to the Tribal Implementation Plan provisions
imposing NAAQS-related requirements, but might be determined to be subject to State regulation for some other CAA
program. This entanglement could potentially subject a source to differing local regulatory authorities, possibly
with conflicting goals and approaches, and potentially duplicative or inconsistent reporting, monitoring and
other regulatory requirements. There is no evidence that Congress intended to create such complex jurisdictional
entanglements. These entanglements are reasonably avoided by interpreting the CAA as granting to approved Tribes
regulatory authority over all air resources within a reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Further, a grant of authority to Tribes for NAAQS-related purposes alone would conflict with the implementation
of the operating permit program called for by Title V of the Act. Title V explicitly prohibits partial State permit
programs unless, at a minimum, such a program ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ensures compliance with
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 *&blank;*&blank;* [a]ll requirements of [Title] I *&blank;*&blank;* applicable to sources required to have a permit.''
Section 502(f) (emphasis added); see also section 502(b)(5)(A) (requires permitting authorities ``to have adequate
authority to *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by sources required to have a permit under this title with each applicable standard, regulation, or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'') (emphasis added) and section 504(a) (each permit issued under Title V ``shall include *&blank;*&blank;* conditions
as are necessary to assure compliance with the applicable requirements of this [Act], including the requirements
of the applicable implementation plan''). Since States could not unilaterally ``ensure compliance with *&blank;*&blank;*
[a]ll requirements of [Title] I'' within Indian reservations because Tribes are granted authority over implementation
plans under section 110(o), it appears that States could not, in fact, submit Title V permit programs for Indian reservations
that would conform with section 502(f) or other provisions of Title V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A basic rule of statutory construction is to avoid interpreting a statute in a manner that would nullify or render meaningless
a statutory provision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because section 110(o) confers on approved Tribes the authority to administer Title I programs on Indian reservations,
the provision of Title V requiring that a permit program must at a minimum ensure compliance with the applicable requirements
of Title I cannot be met by States seeking authority to implement a Title V program within the boundaries of a reservation.
These provisions can reasonably be harmonized by construing the Act as generally granting approved Tribes CAA regulatory
authority over all air resources within the exterior boundaries of their reservations. Thus, this statutory structure
further supports EPA's proposed interpretation of the CAA as granting approved Tribes authority within reservation
boundaries.

Based on recent Supreme Court case law, EPA has construed the term ``reservation'' to incorporate trust land that

111 S.Ct. 905, 910 (1991). EPA will be guided by relevant case law in interpreting the scope of ``reservation'' under
the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301(d)(2)(B) of the CAA also provides that a Tribe may be treated in the same manner as a State for functions
regarding air resources ``within the exterior boundaries of the reservation or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
other areas within the tribe's jurisdiction'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(emphasis added). The emphasized language envisions potential Tribal jurisdiction under the CAA over areas that
lie outside the exterior boundaries of a reservation, upon a fact-based showing of a Tribe's inherent authority over
sources located on such lands. Thus, this provision authorizes an eligible Tribe to develop and implement Tribal
air quality programs on off-reservation lands that are determined to be within the Tribe's inherent jurisdiction.
Accordingly, for purposes of this rule, EPA proposes to conclude that an eligible Tribe may be able to implement its
air quality programs on off-reservation lands up to the limits of ``Indian country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. section
1151, provided the Tribe can adequately demonstrate authority to regulate air quality on the off-reservation lands
in question under general principles of Indian law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, EPA is proposing to interpret the CAA as granting approved Tribes regulatory authority over all air resources
within the exterior boundaries of their reservations. Thus, no independent fact-based showing of inherent Tribal
jurisdiction will be required for air resources located within such reservation boundaries. EPA recognizes that
``other'' off-reservation areas may fall within Tribal jurisdiction. EPA is proposing to interpret the CAA as providing
no blanket grant of Federal authority for such areas. Thus, for off-reservation areas, a Tribe must demonstrate that
it has inherent authority over sources it seeks to regulate under general principles of Indian law.

The CAA authorizes EPA to protect air quality throughout Indian country. EPA intends to use this authority to remedy
and prevent gaps in CAA protection for Tribal air resources. EPA's authority to provide this CAA protection is based
in part on the general purpose of the Act, which is national in scope. As stated in section 101(b)(1) of the Act, Congress
intended to ``protect and enhance the quality of the

Section 301(a) of the Act delegates to EPA broad authority to issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the
functions of the Act. Further, several provisions of the Act call for Federal issuance of a program where, for example,
a State fails to adopt a program, adopts an inadequate program or fails to adequately implement a required program.

E.g.,

sections 110(c) and 502 (d), (e), (i) of the Act. It follows that Congress intended that EPA would similarly have broad
legal authority in instances when Tribes choose not to develop a program, fail to adopt an adequate program or fail
to adequately implement an air program authorized under section 301(d). In addition, section 301(d)(4) of the CAA
empowers the Administrator to directly administer CAA requirements so as to achieve the appropriate purpose, where
Tribal implementation of CAA requirements is inappropriate or administratively infeasible. These provisions
evince Congressional intent to authorize EPA to directly implement CAA programs where Tribes fail to submit approvable
programs or lack authority to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, EPA is currently providing Federal support for CAA protection within reservations. For example, EPA administers
the permit program governing review of proposed new and modified major stationary sources of air pollution (``new
source review'' or ``NSR'') on Reservations and other areas in Indian country (hereafter ``Tribal lands''). There
are several reasons for this emphasis in the exercise of EPA's authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many Tribal lands have air quality that presently meets the national ambient air quality standards (``NAAQS''),
and the central concern is to prevent the relatively clean air from significantly deteriorating. Thus, EPA has ensured
that major sources seeking to locate on Tribal lands obtain the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'')
permit required under the CAA's NSR program. In broad overview, this program imposes limitations on the ambient air
quality impact of new or modified major stationary sources and requires the application of best available control
technology on such sources. See section 165 of the Act. Similarly, in those circumstances where the air quality on
Tribal lands currently is worse than the NAAQS, EPA's administration of the nonattainment NSR program prevents the
air quality from further deteriorating by ensuring that a proposed major source implements the most stringent control
technology (the ``lowest achievable emission rate'' as defined in section 171(3)) and offsets its emissions by obtaining
emissions reductions from nearby sources. Section 173 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners and operators that construct air pollution sources on Tribal lands without first obtaining the proper permit
from EPA expose themselves to Federal enforcement action and citizen suits. For example, section 165 of the Act, 42
U.S.C. 7475, prohibits the construction of a major emitting facility that does not have a PSD permit. Section 173,
42 U.S.C. 7503, contains a similar requirement for new and modified major stationary sources in nonattainment areas.
Sections 113 and 167, 42 U.S.C. 7413 &amp; 7467, authorize EPA to take enforcement action (including, in certain instances,
criminal action) against an owner or operator that is in violation of the requirement to obtain a preconstruction
permit that meets the requirements of the Act. Furthermore, section 304 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7604, authorizes any
person to bring a ``citizen suit'' in U.S. district court against an owner or operator who constructs any new or modified
major stationary source without a PSD permit or nonattainment NSR permit that meets the Act's requirements.

EPA also currently provides technical and financial support to Tribes that have initiated the process of developing
Tribal air programs. For example, some EPA Regional Offices are currently providing such assistance to Tribes that
have air quality that is worse than the NAAQS. The objective is to assist the Tribes in developing a strategy for controlling
emissions from existing sources that will bring the area back into attainment with the NAAQS. Because EPA has not finalized
today's rule authorizing Tribes to submit Federal CAA programs to EPA for approval, some EPA Regions are now working
with Tribes to develop programs that will be promulgated and administered by EPA until this rule is finalized and a
Tribal program is approved.

In addition, as described in Part I.B, there are some programs that are solely Federal programs (e.g. Phase I of the
Acid Rain Program and Title VI of the Act, which provides for the phase-out of certain substances that deplete stratospheric
ozone). Such programs apply to sources located on Tribal lands in the same manner as sources on lands subject to State
jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA views these efforts as an important and substantial first step in providing CAA protection of reservation air
resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also intends to develop an implementation strategy for achieving Federal CAA protection of air resources within
Indian reservations. The strategy will be designed to prioritize EPA resources in support of this rule. It is EPA's
policy to assist Tribes in developing comprehensive and effective air quality management programs to insure that
Tribal air quality management programs will be implemented to the extent necessary on Indian reservations. EPA will
do this by, among other things, providing technical advice and assistance to Indian Tribes on air quality issues.
EPA intends to consult with Tribes to identify their particular needs for air program development assistance and
to provide on-going assistance as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as it required many years to develop State and Federal programs to cover lands subject to State jurisdiction,
so it will require time to develop Tribal and Federal programs to cover reservations and other lands subject to Tribal
jurisdiction. As a first step in this process, EPA intends to draft a Plan for Reservation Air Program Implementation
that will provide a strategy for developing reservation programs in accordance with this policy. The Plan will identify
priority needs and include a strategy to address them by providing technical and grant assistance for the development
of air quality management programs. EPA will seek appropriate input from Tribal governments in developing the Plan.

C. Objective of Tribal Primacy and Self-Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ultimately, of course, EPA would prefer to work with Tribes to have the Tribes develop and administer their own air
quality management programs under the CAA, just as EPA works with States. This is the principal objective of the Federal
financial assistance described in Part IV below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some Tribes may entirely develop their own CAA programs, other Tribes may consider forming Tribal consortia.
Smaller Tribes in particular may wish to form consortia or create inter-Tribal agencies as ways to develop the necessary
expertise to administer CAA programs in a cost-effective way. One of the advantages of forming a consortium of Tribes
is that a Tribe may rely on the expertise and resources of the consortium in demonstrating that the Tribe is reasonably
expected to be capable of carrying out the functions to be exercised, as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action also does not require Tribes to develop CAA programs wholly from scratch. For example, a Tribe may adopt
or incorporate standards from an adjacent or similarly situated State, with appropriate revisions that would adapt
the State standards to reservation conditions and Tribal policies. The use of such adaptations would enable Tribes
to build on State experience and expertise, and might represent quicker and less costly ways to establish Tribal programs
than developing Tribal programs independently. This technique of utilizing small-scaled adaptations of State
programs would allow Tribes to build experience and expertise that could later be used to revise existing programs,
if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribes could also choose to negotiate a cooperative agreement with an adjoining State to jointly plan and administer
CAA programs that are appropriately tailored to individual reservation conditions and Tribal policies. Such an
agreement would be subject to the review and approval of the Administrator or her delegatee, if it is to be made part
of an approvable Tribal air program under the CAA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aside from any formal arrangements between Tribes and States, EPA notes that the objective of this rule, and EPA's
responsibility in overseeing the administration of the CAA, is to provide air quality protection. Therefore, EPA
encourages all affected sovereigns to work cooperatively in informal capacities to protect the public health and
welfare from the serious health and welfare effects associated with air pollution.

III. Tribal CAA Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The discussion which follows addresses streamlined procedures that EPA is proposing to satisfy the eligibility
requirements set out in section 301(d)(2) of the Act. These are proposed requirements that Tribes must meet in order
to obtain approval to implement CAA programs. The discussion also identifies those provisions of the Act for which
EPA is proposing to treat Indian Tribes in the same manner as States and those provisions for which EPA believes such
treatment is infeasible or otherwise inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of EPA's central concerns is to encourage Tribes to develop and administer Clean Air Act programs on Tribal lands
in the same way that States currently do on State lands. This concern is grounded in the objective of Tribal self-government
as enunciated in both the Federal and the EPA Indian Policies. In order to facilitate this process, EPA is proposing
to eliminate duplicative review and unnecessary delay during EPA's processing of Tribal program submittals. The
eligibility determination process proposed in today's action is consistent with an EPA policy pronouncement that
followed from EPA's review of the Tribal programs it administers under other environmental statutes. Further, EPA
is proposing to accept ``reasonably severable'' Tribal air program submittals that meet the applicable requirements
of the CAA. This will allow Tribes to identify and then immediately target their most important air quality issues
without the corresponding burden of developing entire CAA programs. Further, it allows Tribes to develop incremental
expertise that will facilitate development and expansion of further programs over time.

A. New Process for Determining Eligibility for CAA Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible to be treated in the same manner as a State for CAA programs, including financial assistance, an applicant
must meet the definition of ``tribe'' in section 302(r) of the Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it must be Federally recognized) and must satisfy the three criteria set forth in section 301(d)(2)(A)&hyph;(C)
of the Act. These criteria are set out in today's proposed rule and concern the Tribe's governing body, its jurisdiction,
and its capability to carry out the necessary functions under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general these same criteria are set forth under the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA has previously
issued regulations implementing the criteria under those Acts. These regulations have come to be known as the ``treatment
as a state'' (``TAS'') process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Approval under this process was required every time a Tribe sought to obtain an EPA grant or implement an EPA program
on its reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that Tribes are sovereign nations with a unique legal status and a relationship to the Federal government
that is significantly different from that of States. EPA believes that Congress did not intend to alter this when it
authorized treatment of Tribes ``as States'' under the CAA. Rather, Congress intends to ensure that, to the extent
appropriate and feasible, Tribes may assume a role in implementing the CAA on Tribal lands that is comparable to the
role States have in implementing the CAA on State lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the ``TAS'' process proved to be quite burdensome to Tribes, EPA formed a working group to focus on ways of improving
and simplifying the process. After considering the workgroup's recommendations, EPA announced a policy that is
intended to streamline and simplify the process. Memorandum from F. Henry Habicht, the Deputy Administrator of EPA,
to the Agency, dated November 10, 1992. EPA is proposing to implement this new policy in this rulemaking, and is calling
the resulting new process the ``eligibility'' process. See also 56 FR 1380 (March 23, 1994) (proposing similar revision
to Tribal approval process in Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act regulations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new eligibility process proposed in today's action, a Tribe does not need to go through a separate eligibility
review every time it seeks approval for grant funding or to implement a specific program. Instead, a Tribe's eligibility
may be determined at the same time that it seeks approval for a particular program. By making the eligibility determination
a part of the program approval process, much of the delay and duplication inherent in the old sequential TAS process
should be reduced, if not eliminated. In addition, EPA is proposing to simplify some of the demonstrations of eligibility
that will be required under the Clean Air Act, as discussed below. Finally, after promulgation of this rule, EPA intends
to facilitate development of Tribal applications by providing Tribes with a narrative checklist of the eligibility
requirements described below.

1. Federally Recognized Tribe
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Tribe is defined in section 302(r) of the Act as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
[A]ny Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village, which
is Federally recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians
because of their status as Indians. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement of Federal recognition is common to all statutes authorizing EPA to treat Tribes in a manner similar
to that in which it treats States. Any Tribe that has been approved for ``TAS'' under any of the existing Water Act regulations
or any other EPA program is Federally recognized. Moreover, once a Tribe has been found to be Federally recognized
in the course of approval under any EPA-administered statute, or any provision of the CAA, it need only so state in the
future. To facilitate review of Tribal applications, EPA therefore requests that Tribal applications inform EPA
whether the Tribe has been approved for ``TAS'' under the old process or deemed eligible to receive funding or authorization
for any EPA-administered environmental program under the revised process governing treatment of Tribes in the same
manner as States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any other Tribe need only state that it appears on the list of Federally recognized Tribes that the Secretary of the
Interior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodically publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. See 58 FR 54364 (Oct. 21, 1993). If the Tribe notifies EPA that it has been recognized but is not included on this list
because the list has not been updated, EPA will verify the fact of recognition with the Department of the Interior (``DOI'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Substantial Governmental Duties and Powers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Tribe also must show that it ``has a governing body carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers.'' This
requirement is also found in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (``Clean Water Act'') and the Public Health Service
Act (``Safe Drinking Water Act''). See 33 U.S.C. 1377(e) &amp; 42 U.S.C. section 300j&hyph;11(b). Accordingly,
as discussed above, a Tribe that has had a submittal approved by EPA under either of these provisions has already established
that it meets the governmental requirement and need not make this showing again. Similarly, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribe that has made this showing in the course of obtaining approval for a Clean Air Act program need not do so again.
In either case, a Tribe may simply state that it has already been approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Tribe that has not yet made its initial showing of ``substantial governmental duties and powers'' can do so by demonstrating
that it has a governing body that is presently carrying out substantial governmental functions. A Tribe will be able
to make the required demonstration if it is currently performing governmental functions to promote the public health,
safety, and welfare of its population within a defined area. Many Indian Tribal governments perform these functions.
Examples of such functions include, but are not limited to, levying taxes, acquiring land by exercising the power
of eminent domain, and police power. Such examples should be included in a narrative statement supporting the certification,
which describes: (1) The form of the Tribal government, (2) the types of essential governmental functions currently
performed, such as those listed above; and (3) the legal authorities for performing these functions (e.g. Tribal
constitutions or codes). It should be relatively easy for Tribes to meet this requirement without submitting copies
of specific documents unless requested to do so by EPA.

3. Jurisdiction Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in section II.A above, EPA is proposing to interpret the CAA as granting or delegating certain Federal
authority to approved Tribes over all air resources within the exterior boundaries of their reservations. Generally,
therefore, the significant issue that remains in determining the extent of Tribal jurisdiction is the precise boundary
of the reservation in question. Accordingly, a Tribal jurisdictional showing must identify, with clarity and precision,
the exterior boundaries of the reservation. Consistent with the simplified review process, EPA is not proposing
to specify particular supporting materials that the Tribe must provide. However, a Tribal submission will need to
contain information adequate to demonstrate to EPA the location and limits of the reservation, which will usually
include a map and a legal description of the area. EPA will determine the meaning of the term ``reservation'' as indicated
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that there may be less frequent instances when more complex legal and factual demonstrations must be made to establish
jurisdiction. As indicated above, section 301(d)(2)(B) of the Act addresses jurisdiction over ``air resources
within the exterior boundaries of the reservation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or other areas within the tribe's jurisdiction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis added). While EPA is proposing to construe the Act as delegating to Tribes authority over all air resources
within the exterior boundaries of their reservations, the Agency will require a Tribe to demonstrate its inherent
authority over any areas outside of the exterior boundaries of the reservation before EPA will approve a Tribal program
covering such areas. Where a Tribe seeks to develop and administer an air program on off-reservation lands, the Tribal
submittal must be accompanied by appropriate legal and factual information which supports its inherent authority
to regulate emission sources located on such lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the TAS process which EPA has implemented in the past, EPA would not determine that a Tribe had the requisite jurisdiction
without first notifying appropriate ``governmental entities,'' such as States, other Tribes and Federal land management
agencies, of the Tribe's jurisdictional assertions. Those entities were then given an opportunity to comment on
the Tribe's jurisdictional statement, and whenever a comment raised a ``competing or conflicting claim,'' EPA could
not approve the Tribal application without first consulting with DOI. Consistent with the revised eligibility policy,
EPA is proposing to implement a more streamlined approach under the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first time a Tribe submits an application to EPA under the CAA, EPA will, upon receipt of the application, notify
all appropriate ``governmental entities''
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 regarding the Tribe's assertion of jurisdiction. The precise content of EPA's notification of other governmental
entities will depend on the geographic extent of the Tribe's jurisdictional assertion. Specifically, if a Tribe
seeks only to implement a CAA program within the exterior boundaries of its reservation, EPA's notification of other
governments will only specify the geographic boundaries of the reservation, as set forth in the Tribe's application.
However, where a Tribe seeks to administer a CAA program on lands outside the exterior boundaries of a reservation,
EPA will notify the appropriate governmental entities of the substance of and bases for the Tribe's assertion of inherent
jurisdiction with respect to such off-reservation lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the CAA rule, EPA is proposing to adopt the same definition of ``governmental entities'' as the Agency
did in its December 1991 Water Quality Standards regulation. See 56 FR 64876 at 64884 (Dec. 12, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appropriate governmental entities will have fifteen days following their receipt of EPA's notification to provide
formal comments to EPA regarding any dispute they might have with the Tribe concerning the boundary of the reservation.
Where a Tribe has asserted jurisdiction over off-reservation lands, and has included a more detailed jurisdictional
statement in its application, appropriate governmental entities may request a one-time fifteen day extension to
the general fifteen day comment period. In all cases, comments from appropriate governmental entities must be offered
in a timely manner, and must be limited to the Tribe's jurisdictional assertion. Where no timely comments are presented,
EPA will conclude that there is no objection to the Tribal applicant's identified reservation boundaries (or, if
relevant, its assertion of jurisdiction outside the reservation). Further, to raise a competing or conflicting
claim, a commenter must clearly explain the substance, basis, and extent of its objections. Finally, where EPA receives
timely notification of a dispute, it may obtain such additional information and documentation as it believes appropriate
and may, at its option, consult with DOI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where EPA identifies a dispute and cannot confidently resolve it promptly, it will retain the option of limiting approval
of a Tribal program to those areas that a Tribe has clearly shown are part of the reservation (or are otherwise within
the Tribe's jurisdiction). This will allow EPA to approve the portion of a Tribal application that covers all undisputed
areas, while withholding action on the portion of the application that addresses areas where a jurisdictional issue
has not been satisfactorily resolved. However, this approach will be subject to any applicable statutory restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once EPA has made a determination under the CAA or other EPA-administered environmental programs concerning the
boundaries of a reservation, it will rely on that determination in evaluating all future applications from that Tribe
under the CAA unless the application presents different legal issues. For example, once the Agency has arrived at
a position concerning a reservation boundary dispute, it will not alter that position in the absence of significant
new factual or legal information. Thus, as with the recognition and governmental requirements, there will generally
be no need to provide EPA with additional demonstrations of jurisdiction, unless the Tribe is making a more expansive
jurisdictional assertion in a subsequent submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that this new process for resolving questions of jurisdiction constitutes a significant improvement
over the old TAS jurisdiction process. It will provide States with an opportunity to notify EPA of boundary disputes
and enable EPA to obtain relevant information as needed while minimizing delays in the process and focusing its inquiry
on what is likely to be the principal relevant issue, namely, the geographic boundaries of the reservation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Capability Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301(d)(2)(C) of the CAA provides that in determining Tribal eligibility the Administrator also must determine
that the Tribe ``is reasonably expected to be capable *&blank;*&blank;* of carrying out the functions to be exercised
in a manner consistent with the terms and purposes of [the CAA] and all applicable regulations.'' A program-by-program
inquiry into the question of capability is necessary since a Tribe may have capability to carry out certain activities
but not others. Therefore, EPA may request that to establish capability a Tribe submit a narrative statement or other
documents showing it is capable of administering the program for which it is seeking approval. The specific capabilities
which must be described are set forth in today's proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating a Tribe's demonstration of capability, EPA may consider the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Tribe's previous management experience; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Existing environmental or public health programs administered by the Tribe; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The mechanism(s) in place for carrying out the executive, legislative, and judicial functions of the Tribal government;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The relationship between regulated entities and the administrative agency of the Tribal government that will
be the regulator; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The technical and administrative capabilities of the staff to administer and manage the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that certain Tribes may not have substantial experience administering environmental programs.
A lack of experience will not preclude a Tribe from demonstrating the required capability. Otherwise Tribes would
be placed in the dilemma of being denied the opportunity to develop the requisite capability because they lack such
capability. For this reason, today's proposed rule requires Tribes either to show that they have the necessary management
and technical skills or to submit a plan detailing steps for acquiring those skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this flexibility does not change the requirement that to obtain approval for a particular program under
the CAA the Tribe must submit a fully effective program that meets all the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements
associated with the program in question. Because a Tribe may not want to go through the expense of developing such a
program without first being assured of meeting the eligibility requirements, today's proposed rule provide that
a Tribe may, at its option, ask for a preliminary finding on any or all of these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's evaluation of capability will also consider the relationship between the existing or proposed Tribal agency
that will implement the program in question and any potential regulated Tribal entities. It is not uncommon for a Tribe
to be both the regulator and regulated entity, and such a situation could result in a conflict of interest since the
Tribe would then be regulating itself. Independence of the regulator and regulated entity best assures effective
and fair administration of a program.

A Tribe will generally not be required to divest itself of ownership of any regulated entities to address this problem.

This discussion is intended to alert Tribes at an early date about a potential bar to regulatory program assumption
that must be resolved. For example, section 110 of the CAA sets out some of the basic requirements that SIPs must meet
to assure attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. Section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act directs that SIPs must provide
requirements that the State comply with the requirements applicable to State boards under section 128. Section 128,
in turn, provides that each SIP shall contain requirements that:

EPA does not intend to limit Tribal flexibility in creating structures which will ensure adequate separation of the
regulator and regulated entity. Instead, EPA will evaluate whether the Tribal submittal will ensure adequate separation
of the regulator and regulated entity on a case-by-case basis in the context of the statutory and regulatory requirements
applicable to the CAA program for which a Tribe is seeking approval.

Each member of a Tribal consortium must meet the eligibility qualifications described above. However, members of
a consortium may rely on the expertise and resources of the consortium in demonstrating that the Tribe meets the capability
requirement described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, some members of a consortium may have more technical expertise and environmental management experience
than other members. A Tribe with less resources and expertise may rely on the combined resources of the consortium
in demonstrating that the Tribe is ``reasonably expected'' to be capable of carrying out the functions to be exercised.
However, a Tribe relying on a consortium in this manner must provide reasonable assurances that the Tribe has responsibility
for carrying out necessary functions in the event the consortium fails to.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Tribal Implementation is Generally Appropriate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part III.A discussed the eligibility requirements that a Tribe must meet in order to be treated as a State under the
Clean Air Act. There is a separate question of whether it is appropriate to treat eligible Tribes in the same manner
as States for all provisions under the Act, or whether only certain provisions lend themselves to such an approach.
The Act provides that the Administrator shall promulgate regulations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
specifying those provisions of [the CAA] for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301(d)(2). The Act further provides,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[i]n any case in which the Administrator determines that the treatment of Indian tribes as identical to States is inappropriate
or administratively infeasible, the Administrator may provide, by regulation, other means by which the Administrator
will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301(d)(4). Thus, read together, the Act delegates to the Administrator broad discretion in determining
those provisions of the Clean Air Act for which Tribes should be treated in the same manner as States and those provisions
for which such treatment would be inappropriate or infeasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is EPA's basic position, proposed here, that treatment of Tribes in the same manner as States is appropriate for
all programs under the Act with the exception of only a few provisions (those for which EPA has determined that it is
infeasible or otherwise inappropriate to treat States and Tribes in the same manner). EPA proposes to be inclusive
in identifying the provisions of the Act for which it is appropriate to treat Tribes in the same manner as States so as
to maximize the opportunities for Tribal participation in CAA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this basic approach, today's proposed rule provides that Tribes will generally be treated in the same manner
as States for all the provisions of the Clean Air Act, and specifies the limited exceptions to this approach. EPA is
proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for all of the remaining provisions of the statute not identified
as exceptions in the discussion below. Today's action also addresses alternative means to achieve the intended purpose
of the Act, where EPA believes such provisions are necessary in light of a proposed exception. Section 301(d)(4).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A common concern raised by both Tribes and States during the development of this proposed rule was the potential for
sources located on State or Tribal lands to adversely impact air quality on downwind State or Tribal lands. EPA is proposing
in this rule that the CAA protections against interstate pollutant transport apply with equal force to States and
Tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, EPA is proposing that the prohibitions and authority contained in sections 110(a)(2)(D) and 126
of the CAA apply to Tribes in the same manner as States. Section 110(a)(2)(D), among other things, requires States
to include provisions in their SIPs that prohibit emissions activity within the State from significantly contributing
to nonattainment, interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS, or interfering with measures under the PSD or visibility
protection programs in another State. Section 126 authorizes any State to petition EPA to enforce these prohibitions
against a State containing an allegedly offending source or group of sources.

2. Exceptions to Tribal Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA notes at the outset that recurring provisions for which EPA is proposing not to treat Tribes in the same manner as
States involve certain Clean Air Act submittal deadlines. The Act contains many deadlines that mandate the submittal
of a State plan, program or other requirement by certain dates. However, Tribes are not similarly compelled to develop
and seek approval of air programs. Section 301(d)(2) provides for EPA to promulgate regulations specifying ``those
provisions of this [Act] for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes as States'' but does not require Indian
Tribes to develop CAA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the State program submittal deadlines in the statute are based upon a relatively long history of Clean Air
Act planning and implementation by States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 States have assumed an active role in Clean Air Act implementation since the 1970 Amendments to the Act. By comparison,
in substantial part, Tribal authority for Clean Air Act programs was expressly addressed in the Act for the first time
in the 1990 Amendments. Tribes, therefore, are at best in the early stages of developing air program expertise and
planning efforts. Accordingly, EPA believes it would be both infeasible and inappropriate to subject Tribes to the
State program submittal and related deadlines in the statute as explained in more detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Note also that many of the submittal deadlines run from the enactment of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on November
15, 1990. Therefore, Tribes submitting programs in response to the final rule authorizing the treatment of Tribes
as States for those provisions would already be substantially behind in meeting the deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A related set of provisions are the sanctions and other Federal oversight mechanisms in the Act which are triggered
when States fail to meet the air program submittal deadlines called for in the Act or when EPA disapproves a program
submittal. In several instances, the Act mandates the imposition of sanctions, such as Federal transportation funding
restrictions and two-to-one new source review offsets, by a specific deadline if a State fails to timely submit a required
program or submits a program that is not fully approvable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CAA sections 179 and 502(d)(2)(B). Similarly, the Act often imposes specific deadlines upon EPA for issuing a Federal
program within a certain period after a State fails to submit a program or after EPA disapproves an inadequate State
program.

manner as States for certain provisions contained in these sections.

However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those provisions that mandate the imposition
of Federal sanctions for failure to adequately implement or enforce an approved Clean Air Act program.

, CAA sections 179(a)(4) and 502(i)(2). This includes EPA's authority to withhold all or part of air pollution control
grants awarded under section 105. EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same fashion as States for the purposes of
mandatory sanctions for nonimplementation of an approved Tribal program because once a Tribe has sufficient legal
authority and capability to have a program approved, it should be treated as a similarly situated State. Thus, EPA
expects a Tribe to follow through on its implementation of an approved program in the same manner as a State. This will
provide an incentive for Tribes to maintain the primary role in implementing a previously approved air program and
to administer effective programs. In addition, EPA will also treat Tribes in the same fashion as States with respect
to EPA's discretionary authority to impose sanctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach EPA is proposing today regarding Clean Air Act deadlines and Federal sanctions is consistent with the
approach outlined under Parts II.B. and II.C. of this notice. EPA's principal goal is to have Tribes develop and administer
their own CAA programs. As indicated, EPA intends to issue guidance subsequent to this rule that sets out in some detail
the Federal efforts and timetables for providing broader air quality protection for reservation air resources in
those instances when Tribes choose not to develop their own programs. EPA intends to provide direct Federal Clean
Air Act protection on reservations if, after some reasonable time, its efforts to assist Tribes in developing Tribal
programs under the Act do not in fact lead to Tribal program adoption and approval.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards applicable implementation plan submittal deadlines and related sanctions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the general discussion above, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for
the general implementation plan submittal deadlines specified in section 110(a)(1) of the Act. Further, Tribes
will not be subject to the plan submittal deadlines for nonattainment areas set out in sections 172(a)(2), 182, 187,
189, and 191. EPA also is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the deadlines set out in section
124, associated with the review and revision of implementation plans related to major fuel burning sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States with respect to the statutory requirements that
will apply in evaluating a Tribal program once a Tribe has decided to make a submittal. Further, as indicated previously,
EPA intends to issue guidance specifying timeframes by which it will provide Federal protection for Tribes that have
air quality worse than the NAAQS but are unable to develop their own CAA programs. The timing of Federal protection
will be informed by the applicable Clean Air Act NAAQS attainment deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also consistent with the general discussion above, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States
for the imposition of certain mandatory sanctions by EPA under section 179 because a Tribe has failed to submit a Tribal
Implementation Plan (TIP) or other requirement, has made an incomplete submittal, or has made a submittal that is
in part or in whole not approvable. See CAA section 179(a)(1)&hyph;(3); see also discussion under Part III.C.1. of
this preamble, concerning EPA's ``modular'' approach to Tribal Air Programs (TAPs). However, EPA is proposing to
treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those provisions of section 179 mandating the imposition of sanctions
when EPA determines that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented. See CAA section 179(a)(4). In
addition, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States with respect to EPA's discretionary authority
to impose sanctions. See CAA section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the provisions of section 110(c)(1) that direct
EPA to issue a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) within two years after EPA finds that a State has failed to submit a
required plan or has submitted an incomplete plan or within two years after EPA has disapproved a plan in whole or in
part. This exception would apply only for that provision of section 110(c)(1) that sets a specified date by which EPA
must issue a FIP. Treating Tribes in a similar manner as States under that provision would be inappropriate since Tribes
are not in the first instance, like States, required to make submittals by a date certain, and in light of the very recent
initiation of Tribal air quality planning efforts. EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for
all other provisions of section 110(c)(1). Thus, EPA would continue to be subject to the basic requirement to issue
a FIP for affected areas within some reasonable time. EPA would give substantial weight to Tribal air quality needs
in determining what is reasonable in particular instances. Further, as discussed in Part II.B., EPA intends to spell
out in subsequent guidance the specific programs that EPA will implement to provide CAA protection within reservations
and on other lands subject to Tribal jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as it treats States for the State Implementation Plan/Tribal
Implementation Plan (SIP/TIP) call provisions under sections 110 (a)(2)(H)(ii) and (k)(5) of the Act. These provisions
authorize EPA to require a State to revise a plan that is inadequate to assure attainment and maintenance of the relevant
NAAQS or is otherwise inadequate to ensure compliance with applicable Clean Air Act requirements. Thus, once a Tribal
Implementation Plan has been approved in whole or in part as meeting an applicable CAA requirement, Tribes will be
similarly subject to these SIP/TIP call provisions.

the submittal of an applicable implementation plan by a specific date. See CAA sections 169B(e)(2), 184 (b)(1) &amp;

provisions under sections 169B, 176A and 184 of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for example, Tribes meeting eligibility requirements for these provisions of the CAA would be treated
in the same manner as States in identifying what areas should be included in ``interstate'' air pollution and visibility
transport regions and in establishing commission membership. For eligible Tribes participating as members of such
Commissions, the Administrator would establish those submittal deadlines that are determined to be practicable
or, as with other non-participating Tribes in an affected transport region, provide for Federal implementation
of necessary measures.

Criminal enforcement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, EPA is proposing that the enforcement provisions of sections 113 and 114 of the Act apply to Tribes in the
same way that they apply to States. This would include the ability of a Tribe to establish its own administrative enforcement
program, so that the Tribe could enforce administrative as well as civil penalties. In both cases, EPA would have the
authority to take necessary enforcement action if the Tribe did not take such action or did not enforce adequately
(e.g. did not impose a sufficient penalty); however, it would be most prudent for Tribes to attempt enforcement in
the first instance. It should also be noted that EPA has a general policy of consulting with Tribal leaders and managers
prior to taking an enforcement action against Tribal owned or managed facilities. November 8, 1984 ``EPA Indian Policy
Implementation Guidance'' at p. 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113(c) of the CAA provides for the imposition of criminal penalties. However, in certain circumstances Indian
Tribes have limited criminal enforcement authority. Federal law prohibits Indian Tribes from holding criminal
trials of or imposing criminal penalties on non-Indians, in the absence of a treaty or other agreement to the contrary.

conviction of any one offense any criminal fine greater than $500. 25 U.S.C. section 1302(7). To provide for the possible
imposition of criminal penalties with respect to facilities located on Tribal lands, each Tribe seeking approval
of a CAA program that requires such authority must enter into a formal Memorandum of Agreement with EPA, through which
it would agree to provide for the timely and appropriate referral of criminal enforcement matters to the EPA Regional
Administrator.

Title V operating permit program submittal deadlines, implementation deadlines and other requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated in the introduction to this section of the preamble, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the
same manner as States for the operating permit program submittal deadline set out in section 502(d)(1). Similarly,
EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States under the provisions of section 502(d)(2)(B) that
mandate the imposition of sanctions under section 179 when a State fails to timely submit a required permit program
or EPA disapproves a permit program. EPA also is not proposing to treat Tribes as States for the provisions of section
502(d)(3) that direct EPA to promulgate and administer a Federal permit program if, within two years after the required
submittal date, EPA has not approved a State permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Similar to the companion provision in Title I described above (i.e., section 110(c)(1)), EPA is proposing
to exclude only those limited provisions of section 502(d)(3) that direct EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action by a date certain (EPA would continue to be subject to the basic requirement to implement a Federal permit program
within a reasonable period; EPA would give substantial weight to Tribal air quality needs in determining what is reasonable
in particular instances). These provisions are inappropriate because Tribes are not in the first instance directed
by the statute to submit their own programs and in light of the fact that the Tribal CAA program development efforts
are at a very preliminary stage.

However, Tribes will be subject to the sanctions provisions of section 502(i) (1)&hyph;(4) in the same manner as States.
Section 502(i) provides for the discretionary and mandatory imposition of section 179 sanctions when EPA determines
that a permitting authority is not adequately administering and enforcing an operating permit program, or a portion
thereof. Thus, once a Tribe submits an operating permit program and EPA approves that program, Tribes will be subject
to the sanction provisions of section 502(i)(1)&hyph;(4) in the same way that States are. In addition, Tribes will
be treated in the same manner as States with respect to EPA's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section
502(d)(2)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the interim approval provisions in section
502(g) of the Act. Those provisions authorize EPA to temporarily grant approval to a program that in substantial part
meets the requirements of the Act, but that is not fully approvable. An interim approval under these provisions expires
on a date established by EPA but not later than two years after the approval. Section 502(g) provides that the Title
V sanctions provisions and obligations of the Administrator to promulgate a Federal operating permit program are
suspended during this interim period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim approval provisions allow EPA to grant States submitting a substantially satisfactory permit program
up to two additional years to submit a fully approvable program without risk of sanctions and Federal implementation.
These provisions are an adjunct of the statutory deadline requiring the submittal of State Title V operating permit
programs by November 15, 1993. If States were not in the first instance required to submit operating permit programs
by that date certain, the relief of additional time to submit an approvable program without the risk of Federal penalties
would be unnecessary. As stated previously, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for Title
V program submittal deadlines. Accordingly, EPA is also not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States
for this related interim approval authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the general modular approach proposed with respect to Tribal programs (discussed below), EPA intends
to allow Tribes some additional flexibility in implementing Title V programs. For example, EPA may allow Tribes to
extend the period for permitting affected Title V sources over as long as five years from program approval. Accordingly,
EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those provisions of section 503(c) of the Act that
direct permitting authorities to establish a phased schedule for acting on permit applications submitted within
the first full year after the effective date of a permit program (or a partial or interim program). Section 503(c) provides
that the phased schedule shall assure that at least one-third of such permit applications will be acted on by the permitting
authority over a period of not to exceed three years after the effective date. EPA is not proposing to subject Tribes
to these provisions. While it is possible that EPA may require some Tribes to permit affected sources within three
years, EPA nevertheless wants to retain the discretion to allow Tribes up to five years to permit affected Title V sources
after the date of program approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Small business assistance program submittal deadline and compliance advisory panel requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the provisions of section 507(a) specifying a deadline
for the submittal of plans for establishing a small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance
assistance program. EPA also is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States under section 507(e) which
directs States to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel. Both of these provisions are inconsistent with section
301(d), which authorizes but does not require Tribes to develop and submit Clean Air Act programs to EPA for approval.
However, if a Tribe elects to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel under section 507(e), the membership specified
in section 507(e)(2) shall be selected by the Tribal leader, legislative bodies and Tribal agencies that correspond
with those identified for States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the preceding discussion identifies those provisions of the CAA for which EPA is not proposing to treat
Tribes in the same manner as States. EPA is proposing that Tribes be treated in the same manner as States for all other
provisions of the statute.

3. Stringency of Tribal Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Clean Air Act, States generally retain legal authority to impose requirements that are more stringent that
Federal standards. Section 116 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7416, expressly reserves States' authority to impose air pollution
control requirements that are more stringent than those specified under the Act. This State discretion is retained
except where the Act explicitly preempts or precludes the establishment of stricter State standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain instances under the Act uniformity is necessary to avoid an undue burden on the interstate sale of goods.
In such instances, Congress has expressly prevented States from imposing stricter State standards and, therefore,
the Federal requirements under the Act represent both the nationwide floor and ceiling. For example, section 209
of the Act, 42 U.S.C. section 7543, limits States' authority to adopt and enforce emission standards for new motor
vehicles.

EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the purposes of both section 116 of the Act and for all
of the CAA preemption provisions, including provisions such as section 177 that authorize exclusions from preemption
provisions. This will clarify EPA's position that Tribes like States generally have authority to exceed minimum
Federal requirements. It will also clarify the fact that Tribes, like States, are preempted from imposing stricter
standards where Congress has so specified. This will advance the overarching purpose of the preemption provisions
to avoid undue barriers on the trade of goods in commerce.

4. Provisions for Which no Separate Tribal Program Required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under some provisions of the CAA, Tribes would have a specific role by virtue of having met the minimum eligibility
requirements discussed in Part III.A, irrespective of whether a specific program is approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, under section 107(d)(3), the Administrator would notify an eligible Tribe of information indicating
that an area within the Tribe's jurisdiction should be redesignated, and the Tribe would have an opportunity to provide
input on that redesignation in the same fashion as a State. Under section 107(d)(3) a Tribe could also submit a revised
designation of any area within its jurisdiction on its own motion. Similarly, under section 112(r)(7)(B)(iii),
risk management plans would be submitted to Tribal Emergency Response Commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 169B, 176A and 184 Tribes meeting eligibility requirements for such provisions shall be treated in
the same manner as States in identifying what areas should be included in interstate air pollution and visibility
transport regions and in establishing commission membership.

EPA always retains any general discretionary authority to make Federal Indian Reservations part of a transport Region
and to include representatives of Indian Tribes as interstate transport Commission members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, treating Tribes in the same manner as States for purposes of section 505(a)(2) would require permitting authorities
under Title V to notify an eligible Tribe that is contiguous to a State in which an emission originates and whose air
quality may be affected by that emission, or that is within 50 miles of the emission source, of any Title V permit applications
that are forwarded to EPA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Permitting authorities would also be required to provide such Tribes an opportunity to submit written recommendations
and to notify such Tribes in writing of any recommendations not accepted and the reasons why. See 40 CFR 70.8(b)(2).
Thus, special procedural provisions would apply to Tribes treated in the same manner as States for the purpose of Title
V notification. This Title V notification and permitting authority obligation to explain any recommendations not
accepted would apply regardless of whether an eligible Tribe has an approved Title V program.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As elaborated below, EPA expects that most recognized Tribes will be able to readily meet the eligibility requirements
for such provisions as Title V permit application notification. To promote intergovernmental coordination, EPA
encourages States and local governments to take steps now to provide Title V notification to Tribes, instead of waiting
for a formal eligibility determination by EPA. EPA also encourages Tribes to exercise the notification rights that
extend to any citizen under the Title V program in the interim period preceding a Tribal eligibility determination,
if necessary to ensure notification. The regulations implementing the Title V operating permit program generally
require that permitting authorities must provide adequate procedures for public notice including offering an opportunity
for public comment and a hearing on the draft permit. See 40 CFR 70.7(h). These procedures include providing notice
of draft permit proceedings to persons on a mailing list developed by the permitting authority, including those who
request in writing to be on the list. See 40 CFR 70.7(h)(1). Thus, a Tribe not determined eligible to be treated in the
same manner as a State for notification could nevertheless ensure that it receives notification of draft permits
by submitting a written request for such notification to appropriate permitting authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to revise existing CAA regulations to reflect this Tribal authority as part of its on-going regulatory
development efforts. EPA also requests public comment identifying any other provisions of the CAA which similarly
do not require a Tribal program submittal in order for a Tribe to have a role in CAA implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all instances, including those provisions of the Act for which no separate Tribal program submittal is required,
it is a statutory requirement that a Tribe meet the section 301(d)(2) eligibility requirements, discussed in Part
III.A above, before it may be treated in the same manner as a State. However, as a practical matter, this should not be
burdensome. Often the provisions not requiring accompanying program submittals are intended to promote intergovernmental
coordination and involve receipt or transmittal of information or active participation on a multigovernmental
entity. Therefore, a minimal demonstration would be necessary to establish Tribal capability to carry out these
functions consistent with the terms and purposes of statutory and regulatory requirements. Further, under today's
proposed streamlined procedures for determining eligibility, EPA has generally simplified the demonstration
that must be made for eligibility approval. Taken together with the minimum capability needed to carry out these particular
requirements, most Federally recognized Tribes are expected to be able to readily demonstrate eligibility to be
treated in the same manner as States for CAA provisions not requiring a program submittal.

C. Procedures for Review of Tribal Air Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, Tribes will be required to comply with the same statutory and regulatory requirements as States for the
CAA programs that are submitted to EPA for approval. The main difference is that section 301(d) does not require Tribes
to develop CAA programs. Thus, a Tribe may decide to implement only those programs, or even portions of programs, that
are most relevant to the air quality situation on its reservation or other lands subject to its jurisdiction. This
``modular approach'' to Tribal CAA program development is discussed further in Part III.C.1 below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 301(d)(3) of the Act provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[t]he Administrator may promulgate regulations which establish the elements of tribal implementation plans and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301(d)(4) provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[i]n any case in which the Administrator determines that the treatment of Indian tribes as identical to States is inappropriate
or administratively infeasible, the Administrator may provide, by regulation, other means by which the Administrator
will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, as discussed previously, section 301(d)(2) delegates to the Administrator broad discretion in determining
those provisions of the Act for which it is appropriate to treat Tribes as States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA interprets these provisions to mean that, both in the case of TIPs and in the case of other Tribal air programs (``TAPs''),
where EPA finds that it is not appropriate for the same requirements to apply to Tribes as to States, EPA may modify those
requirements by rulemaking. Accordingly, in this rulemaking EPA is proposing to make some changes to the State requirements
for Tribal CAA programs. In addition, EPA is proposing to allow a Tribe to demonstrate to EPA that a specific CAA requirement
may be inappropriate for that Tribe in light of the circumstances presented in a particular case. These issues are
discussed further in Parts III.C.2 and C.3 below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Modular Approach to Tribal Air Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because Tribal governments have limited resources, and because Federal funding to support Tribal efforts is also
limited, Tribes may decide to implement only certain of the CAA provisions for which EPA has determined it is appropriate
to treat Tribes in the same manner as States. In order to provide flexibility and incentive for Tribal governments
to assume responsibility for CAA programs, Tribes may submit reasonably severable elements of programs to EPA for
approval instead of entire complex programs. However, in order to be approved, any such submittal must meet all applicable
minimum Federal requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As one of the first steps in identifying Tribal priorities, EPA encourages Tribes to thoroughly assess their current
air quality through emission inventories. Tribes should develop an accurate, comprehensive and current inventory
of emissions from all sources of air pollution within the reservation and should project potential future emissions
based on likely growth. This will help Tribes estimate the nature and location of air quality problems and, in turn,
help prioritize Tribal CAA program development.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of Tribal emissions inventory assessments and projections regarding future growth will help Tribes
to determine whether relatively few or many activities will need to be implemented immediately. Some minor problems
may be addressed through public education and basic strategies to control the sources of pollution. Other problems
may require some combination of monitoring, modelling and the development of Tribal plans and regulations. If future
growth in emissions is projected, Tribes should also consider developing programs for the Prevention of Significant
Deterioration of Air Quality (``PSD''). See Addendum A, ``Title I'' discussion (overview of the PSD program) and
Part III.D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the emissions inventory reveals a potential air quality problem, air quality monitoring can help further characterize
the potential problem. EPA has issued regulations and guidance on air quality monitoring. EPA's air quality monitoring
regulations are set out at 40 CFR part 58. Among other things, Appendices A through G to 40 CFR part 58 describe air quality
network design, criteria for citing air quality monitors and quality assurance criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In prioritizing Tribal efforts, Tribes should also evaluate the expertise and resource requirements needed to implement
desired programs. As stated above, Tribes will be given the flexibility of implementing programs in a modular fashion.
Thus, Tribes can develop reasonably severable CAA programs to address particular air quality problems and submit
them to EPA for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a Tribe having a PM&hyph;10 air quality problem may develop a partial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment implementation
plan that addresses pollution from existing sources but does not, for example, contain a program governing the review
of new sources that propose to locate in the area. EPA would not decline to approve the submittal until the Tribe developed
a nonattainment new source review program for PM&hyph;10 or developed a plan for addressing an ozone pollution problem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a Tribe having relatively good air quality and anticipating likely new source growth in the area may choose
to focus resources on developing a PSD program. The CAA's PSD permit program provides for preconstruction review
of the air quality impacts associated with proposed new or modified major stationary sources in areas meeting air
quality standards. The permitting process is to ensure that the proposed source employs state-of-the-art control
technology, does not cause or contribute to an exceedance of air quality standards, and does not adversely impact
National Parks and Wilderness areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Tribe may develop and submit to EPA for approval a PSD permit program alone. A Tribe expecting certain categories
of new source growth may develop and submit to EPA for approval a PSD permit program addressing those sources or source
categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the rule proposed today, if the implementation plan elements or other partial CAA program submitted by the Tribe
is reasonably severable and meets the applicable minimum requirements under Federal law, EPA will approve the submittal.

2. Procedures for Reviewing and Approving Tribal Implementation Plans (``TIPs'')
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAA contains provisions which specifically govern EPA's review and processing of the State implementation plans
(SIPs) developed under Title I of the Act to provide for attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality
standards (NAAQS). See Addendum A, ``Title I'' discussion. These provisions are set forth in section 110(k) of the
Act. The CAA authorizes EPA to amend, by regulation, the procedures governing the review and processing of analogous
Tribal implementation plans (TIPs). See sections 110(o) and 301(d)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In broad terms, section 110(k)(1) provides the criteria EPA is to apply in determining whether a submittal is complete
and therefore warrants further review and action. See also 57 FR 13,498, 13,565 (April 16, 1992). The EPA's completeness
criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix V. EPA is required to make completeness determinations
within 60 days of receiving a SIP submittal. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness
determination has not been made by EPA within 6 months of EPA's receipt of the submittal. Section 110(k)(1) &amp; 57
FR at 13,565. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(k)(3)&hyph;(4) address EPA's review of submittals that have been deemed complete. For example, section
110(k)(3) provides that EPA shall fully approve submittals that meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act,
and partially approve and disapprove submittals that meet only a portion of the applicable requirements. Section
110(k)(4) further authorizes EPA to conditionally approve commitments by a State to adopt specific enforceable
measures by a date certain that is no later than one year after the approval. The conditional approval is automatically
converted to a disapproval if the State fails to fulfill the commitment. Section 110(k)(2) directs EPA to act on a submittal
within 12 months of determining it to be complete. The Act calls for the imposition of sanctions and the issuance of
a Federal implementation plan when a State fails to submit a required plan or such plan is disapproved. See sections
110(c)(1), 110(m) and 179 of the Act. Guidance on EPA's implementation of these and related provisions is set out in
a July 9, 1992 memorandum from John Calcagni, ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated previously, the Act does not require Tribes to submit TIPs. For that reason and other reasons specified
above, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the implementation plan submittal deadlines
specified in the Act. See Part III.B above. Further, EPA is proposing to accept any reasonably severable portion of
an applicable Tribal implementation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to apply the completeness criteria to TIPs in the manner described below. If a Tribe submits a reasonably
severable portion of a TIP that meets applicable completeness criteria, EPA will continue to process the submittal.
If the submittal is incomplete EPA will return it to the Tribe, identifying the deficiencies. EPA will exercise one
of two options with respect to a complete TIP submittal. EPA will fully approve any portion of a TIP if it is reasonably
severable and meets the applicable Federal requirements. For any portion that is not approvable, EPA will disapprove
the submittal and work closely with the Tribe to correct the identified deficiencies. However, as noted earlier in
Part III.B, EPA's disapproval of a TIP will not have the mandatory sanctions consequences that apply to States under
section 179 of the Act or the consequences under section 110(c)(1) of requiring a FIP within two years of the disapproval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with SIPs, TIPs should be submitted to the EPA Regional Office for the region in which the Tribe is located. Addendum
B to this notice contains a list and the addresses of EPA's Regional Offices and a map indicating the regions that they
encompass. Any Tribes that have not yet been determined to be eligible by EPA for CAA program purposes must submit the
materials described in Part III.A above, in conjunction with any TIP submittal.

3. Procedures for Reviewing Other Tribal Air Programs (``TAPs'')
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will review all other Tribal air program submittals in light of the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements
as well as EPA policy, including the modular concept described above. EPA is proposing in today's rule to treat Tribes
in the same manner as States for all of the provisions of the CAA, with the limited exceptions identified in Part III.B
&amp; C above. However, EPA recognizes that in proposing this rule and obtaining comments, EPA may not have anticipated
and identified all of those requirements applicable to States that would be infeasible or inappropriate to apply
to Tribes. Therefore, EPA is proposing to add a regulatory provision that will generally allow Tribes to demonstrate
to EPA, in conjunction with the submittal of a TAP, that treatment of a Tribe in the same manner as a State for a particular
provision is inappropriate or administratively infeasible. EPA will review the Tribal demonstration and take appropriate
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TAPs should be submitted to the Regional Office for the region in which the Tribe is located. See Addendum B. EPA will
internally review TAPs in the same manner as it reviews State submittals for the specific CAA programs presented,
consulting with and obtaining the concurrence of the appropriate EPA offices. A determination that a TAP is not approvable
or that a Tribe has not met the general eligibility requirements described in Part III.A above does not preclude the
Tribe from making subsequent submittals at a future date. If EPA determines that a Tribal submittal is deficient or
incomplete, EPA will work closely with the Tribe to identify and correct the deficiencies.

The regulations implementing the CAA span many pages of the Code of Federal Regulations. In today's action, EPA is
proposing to add new 40 CFR part 49, which will address the Tribal CAA authority described in this notice. To implement
this authority EPA is also proposing to add a general requirement in part 49 that eligible Tribes will be treated in
the same manner as States under all of EPA's existing, currently effective regulations implementing the Clean Air
Act, except those regulations implementing provisions of the CAA for which EPA has concluded that it would be inappropriate
to treat Tribes as States. Such exceptions are described in detail in Part III.B of this notice.

EPA will undertake a major effort, in conjunction with forthcoming rulemaking initiatives and its periodic review
and revision of existing regulations, to make conforming changes to all CAA implementing regulations. As examples,
today's proposed rule contains conforming modifications to 40 CFR Parts 50 and 81. The discussion below also explains
in detail how the existing regulations implementing new source review permitting requirements and Title V permit
program requirements would be affected by the action proposed today. The general regulatory provision applying
existing, currently effective regulations to Tribes, as described in the previous paragraph, will address the application
of existing regulations during the interim period in which conforming changes are made to CAA regulations.

Further, in Part IV below, EPA outlines potential ways in which EPA's administration of Federal financial assistance

The general Tribal authority provisions proposed in today's action will be codified at 40 CFR part 49. This includes
the following: EPA's proposed interpretation of relevant jurisdictional issues, discussed in Part II; the proposed
simplified eligibility criteria, discussed in Part III.A; the proposed finding that Tribes should generally be
treated in the same manner as States under the CAA, the specific exceptions to this general finding, and the proposed
provision authorizing Tribes to identify and request additional exceptions on an ad hoc basis, discussed in Part

EPA is proposing conforming changes to 40 CFR part 50. These modifications clarify that references to the term ``State''
in 40 CFR Part 50 include, as appropriate, ``Indian Tribe'' and ``Indian country.'' The revisions proposed clarify,
for example, that under 40 CFR 50.2(c), the promulgation of NAAQS shall not be considered in any manner to allow significant
deterioration of existing air quality in any portion of Indian country (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151). They also clarify
that in the same way that section 50.2(d) provides that States retain discretion to establish ambient air quality
standards more stringent than the NAAQS, the establishment of NAAQS in no way prohibits Indian Tribes from establishing
ambient air quality standards that are more stringent than the NAAQS.

The regulations in Part 51 contain the basic requirements for state implementation plans (SIP). However, EPA has
not systematically updated 40 CFR Part 51 since the passage of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. In many instances
these regulatory requirements are inconsistent with the revised law and are therefore inoperative as a matter of
law. See CAA section 193 (``regulation *&blank;*&blank;* in effect before the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 shall remain in effect according to its terms, except to the extent *&blank;*&blank;* inconsistent
with any provision of this Act.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate SIP development under the amended law, EPA has issued guidance documents. These documents reflected
EPA's preliminary interpretations of the relevant Act requirements at that time. See,

EPA is undertaking a comprehensive regulatory effort to revise its PSD rules (and its nonattainment NSR program,
see below) consistent with some of the changes made to the substantive PSD program under the revised Act (and as a part
of a broader reform initiative). Since these revised rules have not yet been promulgated, EPA has issued detailed
guidance addressing transitional and interim implementation issues associated with the changes made by the 1990
Amendments. See 57 FR 18070 at 18074&hyph;77 (April 28, 1992) (Appendix D_``New Source Review (NSR) Program Transitional
Guidance,'' March 11, 1991). At least until any further guidance is provided in EPA's NSR rulemaking, EPA's review
and issuance of PSD permits for applicable sources proposing to locate on Tribal lands will be in accordance with the
previously-issued PSD transitional permitting guidance, today's guidance, and 40 CFR 52.21, to the extent that
the existing provisions of 40 CFR 52.21 are consistent with the amended Act.

Federal NSR Permitting. 40 CFR 52.24(c) provides that 40 CFR part 51, Appendix S (``Offset Ruling'') governs the issuance
of NSR permits (required for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources in nonattainment
areas) where approved State rules are not in place. The Offset Ruling sets out EPA's interpretation regarding the
conditions that are designed to ensure that sources and source modifications subject to the NSR requirements will
be controlled to the greatest degree possible and that more than equivalent offsetting emission reductions will
be obtained from existing sources, thus ensuring progress toward achievement of the NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Amendments to the CAA added new provisions to the Act addressing the substantive NSR permitting requirements.
See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sections 173, 182 and 189(b)(3) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7503, 7511a and 7513a(b)(3). As with the new changes to the PSD
program, EPA has issued guidance addressing the implementation of the revised nonattainment NSR requirements in
the period before EPA's comprehensive regulations are adopted. See 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992); 57 FR 18070, 18075&hyph;77

(Sept. 3, 1992). In the interim period before EPA issues further guidance through its Federal nonattainment NSR rulemaking
to implement the amended Act, EPA intends to conduct nonattainment NSR permitting on Tribal lands consistent with
the Offset Ruling and the transitional EPA guidance addressing the revisions to the Act.

6. 40 CFR Part 70_State [and Tribal] Operating Permit Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This discussion explains how the regulations at 40 CFR Part 70 implementing the Title V operating permit program would
be affected by today's proposed action. EPA is currently developing Federal rules to be codified in 40 CFR Part 71 that
will authorize direct Federal implementation of Title V permit program requirements for States and Tribes that lack
adequate program coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Submittal Deadlines and Processing. Program submittal deadlines are set out at 40 CFR 70.4(a). Tribes will
not be compelled to develop and submit Title V permit programs to EPA for approval. 40 CFR 70.4(e) addresses the processing
of Title V program submittals. Any Tribal submittal that is incomplete or disapproved will be returned to the Tribe
following such determination. To the extent possible, EPA will work with the Tribe to remedy deficiencies in the Tribal
program. However, the timeframes governing EPA's processing of Tribal submittals will be the same as those applicable
to State submittals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Coverage. The regulations call for States to issue permits that assure compliance with ``each applicable
requirement *&blank;*&blank;* by all part 70 sources''. 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i); see also 40 CFR 70.6(a)(1) (``[e]ach
permit issued under this part shall include *&blank;*&blank;* [e]mission limitations and standards *&blank;*&blank;*
that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance''). Approvable Tribal programs
must address all affected Part 70 sources within a Tribe's jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deadlines for Permit Applications and Processing of Applications. 40 CFR 70.5(a) requires the owner or operator
of Part 70 sources to submit applications within 12 months of becoming subject to the program. 40 CFR 70.7(a)(2) requires
the permitting authority to act on an application within 18 months of receipt. To ensure that permits are expeditiously
submitted and reviewed, these deadlines will apply with equal force to Tribal programs, to the extent that Tribes
elect to develop and implement such programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(11) requires States to have a transition plan for acting on applications received within the first
12 months after approval, such that the State will act on one-third of the applications in each of the first three years
of its program. This requirement overrides the 18-month requirement for acting on applications during the first
3 years. As discussed in Part III.B.2.e above, the 3-year implementation requirement in section 503(c) is among the
provisions of the CAA for which EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States. For Tribal programs,
this initial program phase-in will be based on a schedule developed by the Regional Office in conjunction with each
Tribe. This case-by-case approach will ensure that any transition adequately accounts for the scope of Tribal program
coverage, the universe of Part 70 sources and the extent of Tribal expertise and resources. However, EPA is also proposing
to provide that in no case shall such a transitional schedule exceed 5 years from the date of EPA's approval of the Tribal
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement. Required enforcement authority is set out in 40 CFR 70.11. As stated above, Federal law prohibits Indian
Tribes from holding criminal trials of or imposing criminal penalties on non-Indians, in the absence of a treaty or
other agreement to the contrary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oliphant,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 435 U.S. 191. In addition, Federal law prohibits Indian Tribes from imposing for conviction of any one offense a
criminal fine greater than $500. 25 U.S.C. section 1302(7). Tribes requesting Title V program approval will be required
to enter into formal Memorandum of Agreement with EPA, through which it would agree to provide for the timely referral
of criminal enforcement matters to the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operational Flexibility. The three operational flexibility provisions at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) will be optional for
Tribes as will 40 CFR 70.6(a)(8), (10) (emissions trading in the permit) and 40 CFR 70.6(a)(9) which requires States
to include alternative operating scenarios, if requested, in their permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit Issuance, Revisions Procedures. Generally, for the procedures governing permit issuance and revision,
EPA will treat Tribes in the same manner as it treats States. While Tribes will have some flexibility regarding the
form and manner of public notice requirements under 40 CFR 70.7(h), the minimum period for public notice will be 30
days for Tribes as with States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribes, like States, must have authority to reopen permits for cause, as required by 40 CFR 70.7(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application content requirements. These requirements are set out in 40 CFR 70.5. These requirements will apply with
equal force to sources within Tribal jurisdiction, since EPA believes that the information specified in this provision
constitutes the minimum information that is essential to the issuance of an effective permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit content requirements. These are found in 40 CFR 70.6(a), (c). The permit content requirements will generally
apply to Tribes in the same manner in which they apply to States. These remaining requirements are necessary to an effective
permit. These requirements include 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3), which requires the State and, under today's proposal, the
Tribal permitting authority to insert monitoring requirements into the permit where the underlying monitoring
requirement is deficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Judicial Review. 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x)-(xii) requires States to provide an opportunity for judicial review of a final
permit action and for the State's failure to take such final action. Tribes will have to meet the same requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Veto and Citizen Petition Process. 40 CFR 70.8 requires States to provide EPA with a 45-day review period and opportunity
for veto. The provision further specifies that no permit may issue prior to the expiration of that period or at all over
an EPA veto. It also provides citizens the right to petition EPA to veto a State-issued permit. These provisions will
apply with equal force to Tribal programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.8(b) also requires that State programs provide that the permitting authority notify any affected States
of each draft permit. This requirement to provide notice will apply with equal force to Tribal programs. Further,
any State or Tribal permitting authority will provide notice to any affected Tribe in the same manner as the regulations
require notification to affected States. See Part III.B.4 above.

Pursuant to section 107(d)(3) of the CAA EPA would notify eligible Indian Tribes that EPA has information indicating
that an air quality designation for an Indian Reservation should be revised. Then, as with the Governor of an affected
State, the relevant Tribal leader would have 120 days to reply to EPA. In addition, eligible Indian Tribes would on
their own initiative have authority to submit a redesignation request to EPA for approval in the same way that States
and the relevant Governors are authorized to under section 107(d)(3)(D) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Sources of Funding Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Financial assistance for Indian Tribes under the Clean Air Act is available via two principal authorities: grants
for the support of air pollution planning and control programs under section 105 (42 U.S.C. 7405); and grants for investigations,
demonstrations and studies into the causes, effects, extent, prevention and control of air pollution under section
103 (42 U.S.C. 7403). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these potential sources of funds under the Clean Air Act, EPA can provide Tribes funding assistance
for air quality work under the Agency's Indian Environmental General Assistance Grants Program (40 CFR part 35, subpart
Q). These grants provide funds to Tribes for planning, developing and establishing the capacity to implement environmental
programs on Indian lands, regardless of the program's environmental media. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of these assistance and fee programs carries various statutory and/or administrative requirements which are
discussed and explained in this portion of the preamble. Proposed regulatory revisions are set out at the end of this
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Tribal Eligibility for Air Grant Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's action, EPA is proposing to modify certain regulatory and administrative limitations on the manner in
which Indian Tribes qualify for and obtain financial assistance under the Act. EPA also seeks comment from interested
parties on options in meeting the non-Federal matching requirements for grants obtained under section 105 authority.
The financial assistance options are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 103 Air Assessment Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tribes may apply for grant assistance to assess reservation air quality conditions under authority of section 103(b)(3)
of the Act. Section 103(b)(3) allows EPA to fund investigations, research, surveys, and studies concerning any specific
problem of air pollution in cooperation with any air pollution control agency. Tribes may undertake specific projects
to assess Tribal air quality conditions at any time. Typically, Tribes will undertake such projects as an initial
step, prior to initiating development and adoption of Tribal regulations to control air resources. Section 103(b)(3)
grant funds are not available for developing Tribal capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds provided under section 103 are available to Tribes at up to a 95% Federal share. Thus each recipient must contribute
at least five percent of the total allowable project costs. The Agency believes that the five percent cost sharing
requirement should be retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA rules limit award of section 103 grants to a maximum of five years for any one project period. 40 CFR 40.125&hyph;1.
This should allow a reasonable amount of time for Tribal recipients of assistance to assess the nature of their air
quality and determine the extent of any air quality problems. However, the Agency will carefully consider requests
for deviations under 40 CFR 31.6 for extensions of grant project periods. Further, section 103 is available for multiple
project periods. Finally, Tribes that have received previous section 103 grants will remain eligible for future
grants to fund appropriate projects at any time. The determination of each Tribal applicant's continued eligibility
and the appropriate authority of award will be the responsibility of the appropriate Regional Administrator. As
this suggests, Tribes not establishing eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States under section 301(d)
will remain eligible, as they are currently, for assistance under section 103(b)(3).

2. Section 105 Air Program Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency encourages eligible Tribes to apply for continuing environmental assistance under authority of section
105 and 301(d) of the Act, particularly after a comprehensive assessment of reservation air quality conditions.
Section 105 allows EPA to make grants for implementing programs for the prevention and control of air pollution or
implementation of air quality standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, in order to be eligible to receive a grant under section 105, a recipient must meet the definition of an air
pollution control agency specified in section 302(b) of the Act. This definition includes ``[a]n agency of an Indian
tribe.'' See section 302(b)(5). Thus, section 302(b)(5) authorizes 105 grants to Tribes that have not established
their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act expressly provides that until the promulgation of these regulations, EPA may continue to provide section
105 grants to eligible Tribes on this basis. See section 301(d)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that section 301(d)(5) was intended to ensure that Tribes would be able to receive financial assistance
while this regulation was being developed. The Agency does not believe that this provision, which on its face is designed
to ensure Tribal access to funds, must be read to require that EPA cease awarding section 105 grants to Tribes not meeting
the eligibility requirements after this regulation is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with this legal interpretation, this regulation provides two avenues for Tribes to obtain section 105
assistance. A Tribe that does not establish eligibility for treatment in the same manner as a state under section 301
but that is ``an agency of an Indian tribe,'' and therefore meets the definition of an ``air pollution control agency''
under section 302(b)(5), can obtain 105 funds, subject to the same limitations that apply to other 105 grant recipients.
These limitations include the statutory requirement that the grant recipient contribute matching funds for 40%
of the allowable project costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, Tribes that establish their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States under section 301(d)
may, like States, receive section 105 financial assistance. However, assistance to Tribes pursuant to 301(d) can
be provided without being subject to every limitation that applies to such grants when made to States. Section 301(d)(4)
expressly provides that, in cases where it is not appropriate to treat Tribes as identical to States, EPA ``may provide,
by regulation, other means by which the [Agency] will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate
purpose.'' EPA believes that requiring the 40% match as a prerequisite for assistance under section 105 could impose
an undue financial burden on Tribes; the Agency further believes it can best administer section 105 to achieve the
purpose of maximizing tribal access to this assistance by providing relief from the cost share requirement. However,
based on statutory language, this special relief will, as noted above, only be available for Tribes that have established
their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as states and therefore are eligible for financial assistance pursuant
to section 301(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal seeks comments on the appropriate level of Tribal cost share for a section 105 grant match, from a minimum
of 5% to a maximum of 40%. This proposal also seeks comments on the establishment of a phase-in period for Tribes to meet
whatever match is ultimately required for section 105 grants. A 40% match of air grant funds under section 105 is currently
required from States. However, when these air grants were originally awarded some 25 years ago, a 25% State match was
required. Given the lack of Tribal financial resources, there is concern that even this lower level of Tribal match
may not be appropriate in many instances. In addition, the Agency believes it may be appropriate to allow a Tribe establishing
eligibility to be treated in the same manner as a state to begin receiving 105 assistance with a lower match, which would
gradually be phased upward until it reaches some appropriate level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the regulation, EPA discussed the option of developing a sliding scale, with differing
levels of match based on tribal demonstrations of ability to pay. This option is not being proposed in this regulation,
due to the Agency's concern that requiring some tribes to pay a higher match than others could create barriers to participation
by those tribes, and that all tribes experience resource constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also recognizes that its approach should be consistent with President Clinton's April 29 Presidential
Memorandum on ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments.'' 59 FR 22,951 (May
4, 1994). That Memorandum directs agencies to ``take appropriate steps to remove any procedural impediments to working
directly and effectively with tribal governments on activities that affect the *&blank;*&blank;* governmental
rights of the tribes.'' The Agency believes minimizing the burdens to participation by all tribes may be the approach
most consistent with this directive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency is not proposing a sliding scale, it requests comments on whether such an approach might be feasible
and the criteria that could be used to determine the matching requirement for each grant recipient. The Agency solicits
comments on: An appropriate initial match level equal to or exceeding five percent; the length appropriate for a phase-in
period (if any) of the match; the rate at which the match would be phased upward; and an appropriate level for a permanent
match requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act also establishes one purpose for which Tribes may not be treated in the same manner as states. Under
section 301(d)(1)(A) Tribes may not be treated in the same manner as States for purposes of section 105(b)(2) which
ensures that each State applying for assistance have made available to it for application (but not necessarily for
award) a minimum of one half of one percent of the total section 105 amount annually appropriated under the Act.

3. Tribal Agencies and Consortia
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 and 105 assistance is currently available to an individual Tribe because it constitutes an air pollution
control agency under section 302(b)(5). The Agency also believes it may be appropriate to provide assistance to groups
of tribes, typically tribes with air resources that are either contiguous or similar in their characteristics, when
those tribes join into consortia for the purpose of applying for and managing the air quality financial assistance
described above. A consortium is a partnership between two or more Indian tribal governments authorized by their
governing bodies. Tribes can join into consortia in circumstances they find appropriate. The ``economies of scale''
made possible through Tribal consortia arrangements may allow for the assumption of air resource management responsibilities
that may not otherwise be possible with small, single-Tribe environmental agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consortia will have discretion in demonstrating how they will meet the matching funds requirement. Therefore, when
a consortium reaches the point that it must provide matching funds to obtain grant funds, the consortium may combine
its resources to meet the requirement in any manner it deems appropriate.

C. Use of EPA General Assistance Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has recently issued regulations governing the use of Indian Environmental General Assistance Grants as required
under 42 U.S.C. 4368b. Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act of 1992; 42 U.S.C. 4368b, (58 FR 63876,
December 2, 1993) codified at 40 CFR part 35, subpart Q. The regulations establish requirements for applying for and
utilizing general assistance funds. The Indian Environmental General Assistance Grants may be used by Tribes to
fund program development activities in various environmental media, including air, and are thus considered to be
an important means of establishing overall Tribal environmental program capability. Moreover, the award of these
grants in no way precludes a Tribe from applying for, and being awarded, air grant assistance under section 103 or section
105 of the Act.

D. Additional Administrative Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each Tribal application for assistance must still meet the Agency's general administrative requirements for grants
which are set forth in more detail in 40 CFR Parts 31, 32 and 34 and which are not modified by this regulation. Additional
requirements specific to section 105 air grants are detailed in 40 CFR 35 and, for section 103, in 40 CFR Part 40.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(f) of EO 12866 defines ``significant regulatory action'' to mean any regulatory action that is likely to
result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule was determined not to be a significant regulatory action. A draft of this proposed rule was nevertheless
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prior to publication because of anticipated public interest
in this action including potential interest by Indian Tribes and State/local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has placed the following information related to OMB's review of this proposed rule in the public docket referenced
at the beginning of this notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Materials provided to OMB in conjunction with OMB's review of this proposed rule; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Materials that identify substantive changes made between the submittal of a draft proposed rule to OMB and this
notice, and that identify those changes that were made at the suggestion or recommendation of OMB.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the RFA, 5 U.S.C. sections 601&hyph;612, EPA must prepare, for rules subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking,
initial and final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses describing the impact on small entities. The RFA defines small
entities as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Small businesses. Any business which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field as defined
by Small Business Administration regulations under section 3 of the Small Business Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Small governmental jurisdictions. Governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts
or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Small organizations. Any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant
in its field.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the requirement of preparing such analyses is inapplicable if the Administrator certifies that the rule
will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Many Indian Tribes may meet the definition of small governmental jurisdiction provided above. However, the proposed
rule does not place any mandates on Indian Tribes. Rather, it authorizes Indian Tribes to demonstrate their eligibility
to be treated in the same manner as States under the Clean Air Act, to submit CAA programs for specified provisions and
to request Federal financial assistance as described elsewhere in this preamble. Further, the proposed rule calls
for the minimum information necessary to effectively evaluate Tribal applications for eligibility, CAA program
approval and Federal financial assistance. Thus, EPA has attempted to minimize the burden for any Tribe that chooses
to participate in the programs provided in this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Any additional
economic impact on the public resulting from implementation of this proposed regulation is expected to be negligible,
since Tribal regulation of these activities is limited to areas within Tribal jurisdiction and, in any event, EPA
has regulated or may regulate these activities in the absence of Tribal CAA programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small organizations for the
same reasons that the proposed regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact
on a number of small entities.

C. Executive Order (EO) 12875
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EO 12875 is intended to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon State, local and Tribal governments. To that
end, it calls for Federal agencies to refrain, to the extent feasible and permitted by law, from promulgating any regulation
that is not required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a State, local, or Tribal government, unless funds for
complying with the mandate are provided by the Federal government or the Agency first consults with affected State,
local and Tribal governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issuance of this proposed rule is required by statute. Section 301(d) of the CAA directs the Administrator to promulgate
regulations specifying those provisions of the Act for which it is appropriate to treat Indian Tribes as States. Moreover,
this proposed rule would not place mandates on Indian Tribes. Rather, as discussed in section V.B above, this rule
authorizes or enables Tribes to demonstrate their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States under the
Clean Air Act and to submit CAA programs for the provisions specified by the Administrator. Further, the proposed
rule also explains how Tribes seeking to develop and submit CAA programs to EPA for approval may qualify for Federal
financial assistance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and has assigned OMB control number 2030&hyph;0020.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information pertaining to the grants application process has an estimated reporting burden averaging
29 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 3 hours per respondent. These estimates
include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule pertaining to an Indian Tribe's application for eligibility
to be treated in the same manner as a State or ``treatment as a State'' have been submitted for approval to OMB under the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1676.01) and a copy may be obtained from
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202)
260&hyph;2740.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information for Treatment in the Same Manner as States (TISMAS) to carry out the Clean Air Amendments
has an estimated reporting burden of 20 annual responses, averaging 40 hours per response and an estimated annual
recordkeeping burden averaging 800 hours. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including
suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington,
DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC
20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will be accompanied with responses to OMB or public
comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA requests public comments on all aspects of today's proposal, including the following: EPA's proposed interpretation
of the Clean Air Act as delegating to Tribes jurisdiction over all air resources within the exterior boundaries of
the reservation; EPA's proposed interpretation of the term ``reservation''; EPA's proposed interpretation that
in enacting the CAA, Congress found that the activities regulated under the Act constitute a class of activities that,
if left unregulated, could have serious and substantial adverse effects on public health and welfare, and accordingly,
that these activities would generally be within the inherent civil regulatory authority of Tribes; EPA's position
regarding Federally-administered Clean Air Act programs to provide protection for Tribal air resources; EPA's
proposed implementation of its policy for streamlining eligibility determinations; the CAA provisions for which
EPA is proposing to treat Indian Tribes as States, and the proposed exceptions that EPA has identified in this rule;
EPA's general approach to encourage Tribal participation by allowing Tribes to submit reasonably severable portions
of CAA programs; EPA's proposed procedures for reviewing Tribal air programs, including Tribal implementation
plans developed under Title I of the CAA; EPA's proposed revisions to its implementing regulations, and; EPA's proposed
administration of Federal financial assistance to Tribes.

 As part of an interagency ``streamlining'' initiative, EPA is experimenting with submission of public comments
on selected rulemaking actions electronically through the Internet in addition to accepting comments in traditional
written form. This proposed rule is one of the rulemaking actions selected by EPA for this experiment. From the experiment,
EPA will learn how electronic commenting works, and any problems that arise can be addressed before EPA adopts electronic
commenting more broadly in its rulemaking activities. Electronic commenting through posting to the EPA Bulletin
Board or through the Internet using the ListServe function raise some novel issues that are discussed below in this
Section.

to printed, paper form, of a problem or error that results in an obviously garbled comment, EPA will attempt to contact
the comment submitter and advise the submitter to resubmit the comment either in electronic or written form. Some
commenters may choose to submit identical comments in both electronic and written form to ensure accuracy. In that
case, EPA requests that commenters clearly note in both the electronic and written submissions that the comments
are duplicated in the other medium. This will assist EPA in processing and filing the comments in the rulemaking docket.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with ordinary written comments, EPA will not attempt to verify the identities of electronic commenters nor to review
the accuracy of electronic comments. EPA will take such commenters and comments at face value. Electronic and written
comments will be placed in the rulemaking docket without any editing or change by EPA except to the extent changes occur
in the process of converting electronic comments to printed, paper form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will address significant electronic comments either in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or in a response to comments document placed in the rulemaking docket for this proposed rule. EPA will not respond to
commenters electronically other than to seek clarification of electronic comments that may be garbled in transmission
or conversion to printed, paper form as discussed above. Any communications from EPA employees to electronic commenters,
other than those described in this paragraph, either through Internet or otherwise are not official responses from
EPA.

The Clean Air Act is codified in the United States Code (U.S.C.) at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. There are six different
Titles that comprise the Act as codified.

To help illustrate the potential effect of today's proposal, the discussion at times refers to Tribes as if the authority
proposed today was in effect. However, this authority will not be in place until EPA takes final action on today's proposed
rule. The process preceding final action includes the consideration of public comments on today's proposal that
may alter the final rule.

Title I_National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Stationary Source Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for certain air pollutants for the protection
of the public health (``primary'' standards) and welfare (``secondary'' standards). CAA section 109, 42 U.S.C.
7409. EPA establishes these standards after a thorough review of the latest scientific studies and literature indicating
the kind and extent of identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such
pollutants in the ambient air in varying quantities. CAA section 108, 42 U.S.C. 7408. EPA has established health and
welfare NAAQS for six different pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and lead. These standards are codified in 40 CFR Part 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Areas nationwide are ``designated'' based on whether they meet the NAAQS. Areas that do not meet the NAAQS are designated
``nonattainment.'' CAA section 107, 42 U.S.C. 7407. States containing such areas are required to develop State implementation
plans (SIPs) which must bring the areas into attainment as expeditiously as practicable. If EPA finalizes today's
rule as proposed, Tribes may submit such implementation plans (``TIPs''). Title I contains general requirements
that SIPs and, as appropriate, TIPs must meet (CAA section 110(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)) as well as planning provisions
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, inventorying of emissions) and control requirements applicable to existing stationary sources in nonattainment
areas. CAA sections 171&hyph;192, 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7514a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has issued detailed guidance that sets out its preliminary views on the implementation of the air quality planning
requirements applicable to areas that are not in attainment with the NAAQS. This guidance is titled the ``General
Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (or ``General Preamble''). See
57 FR 13,498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18,070 (April 28, 1992). The General Preamble has been supplemented with further
guidance on Title I requirements. See 57 FR 31,477 (July 16, 1992) (announcing the availability of draft guidance
for lead nonattainment areas and serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas); 57 FR 55,621 (Nov. 25, 1992) (guidance
on NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT requirements in ozone nonattainment areas). EPA will likely issue further supplements to the General Preamble.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title I also contains control requirements applicable to new (or modified) major stationary sources. ``Major''
sources are those emitting more than a certain amount of pollutant per year. Sources subject to the New Source Review
(``NSR'') or Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'') requirements may not initiate construction, as
it is defined under the law, without obtaining an NSR or PSD permit from the State or Tribe (or from EPA, if the State or
Tribe has not been authorized by EPA to administer the program). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nonattainment NSR permit program applies only in nonattainment areas. The Act directs EPA to require States and
authorizes EPA to permit Tribes to develop NSR permit programs as part of their SIPs or TIPs. The NSR permit program
requires strict control technology and emissions reductions from nearby sources to ``offset'' emissions released
for proposed new (or modified) major stationary sources in nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, CAA section 173, 42 U.S.C. 7503. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PSD program applies to certain new or modified major stationary sources in areas that currently have air quality
meeting the NAAQS. To prevent the air quality in these areas from significantly deteriorating, the Clean Air Act requires
States in such clean air areas to develop permit programs that impose control requirements on new or modified major
stationary sources. The permit program must also require an assessment of the air quality impacts of proposed sources
to ensure that new sources will not cause or contribute to an exceedance of the NAAQS or certain allowed ``increments''
of air quality degradation. CAA sections 160&hyph;169, 42 U.S.C. 7470&hyph;7479. Since all areas of the country
meet at least one of the NAAQS, all States are required to have a PSD program for areas within their jurisdiction. EPA
administers PSD programs for States that have failed to submit approvable programs. In today's action, EPA is proposing
to authorize Tribes to submit PSD programs for EPA approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is also a minor source permit program, under CAA section 110(a)(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(C), and 40 CFR 51.160&hyph;164
which requires SIPs to include a program regulating the modification and construction of any stationary source,
regardless of size or attainment status, as necessary to assure that the NAAQS are achieved. In today's action, EPA
is proposing to authorize Tribes to include minor source permit programs as part of their TIPs in the same manner as
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA also issues new source performance standards (``NSPS'') that affected new or modified stationary sources
must meet in both attainment and nonattainment areas. States are required to submit, and EPA is proposing that Tribes
be authorized to submit, plans similar to SIPs or TIPs that provide for the implementation and enforcement of certain
requirements for certain pollutants regulated by NSPS. CAA sections 111(d), 129, 42 U.S.C. 7411(d), 7429.

Conformity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7506, prohibits Federal agencies from supporting or providing financial assistance
for activities that do not conform to an approved SIP or TIP. The restriction extends to State, Tribal and local transportation
plans or projects that are approved or funded by a Federal agency.

Visibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I also requires States in which certain mandatory ``class I'' Federal areas (certain national parks, wildernesses
and international parks as specified in section 162(a), 42 U.S.C. 7472(a)) are located, or States whose emissions
may affect such areas, to include provisions in their SIPs to remedy and prevent visibility impairment in those areas.
CAA sections 169A &amp; 169B, 42 U.S.C. 7491 &amp; 7492. In today's action, EPA is proposing to authorize Tribes to
submit visibility TIPs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interstate Pollution Provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 126 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7426, authorizes States to petition the Administrator to find that a major source
or group of stationary sources in one State emits air pollutants that contribute significantly to nonattainment,
interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS, or interfere with measures under the PSD or visibility protection programs
in another State. See also section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act. EPA is proposing that these provisions apply to Tribes
in the same fashion that they apply to States so that a Tribe or State may take such action to remedy pollution from an
upwind Tribe or State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, sections 169B, 176A and 184, 42 U.S.C. 7492, 7506a &amp; 7511c, were added to the Act in the 1990 Amendments
and contain provisions for cooperatively addressing interstate pollution problems. These provisions authorize
(and, in some instances, direct) the establishment of interstate transport commissions to address regionwide visibility
impairment, ozone pollution and other NAAQS pollution issues. The Governors of the affected States (or their designees)
represent the State members of the commissions. Generally, the commissions develop and transmit recommendations
to EPA on the specific issues the commissions are charged with addressing. Thus, the commissions provide a vehicle
for facilitating interstate cooperation and input in addressing air pollution problems that require a regional
solution due to pollutant transport across political boundaries. In today's action, EPA is proposing to extend this
authority to Tribes. Among other things, Tribes would be authorized to petition the Administrator for establishment
of commissions and Tribal leaders included in commission membership in the same fashion as State leaders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions governing the emissions of hazardous air pollutants are also contained in Title I. EPA is directed
to issue control technology standards (``maximum achievable control technology'' or ``MACT'') covering 189 hazardous
air pollutants. CAA section 112, 42 U.S.C. 7412. Section 112 also contains provisions to prevent and minimize the
consequences of accidental releases of, among other things, extremely hazardous substances. States or, as proposed
today, Tribes may develop and submit to EPA for approval, programs implementing both the hazardous air pollutant
emission standards and accidental release requirements.

The Clean Air Act general Federal enforcement provisions are contained in Title I. Section 113 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.
7413, authorizes the imposition of both civil and criminal penalties for violation of Clean Air Act requirements.
It also contains provisions authorizing EPA to pay cash awards to persons furnishing information leading to a criminal
conviction or certain civil penalties.

Section 114 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7414, contains provisions granting EPA broad authority to require, among other things,
recordkeeping, monitoring and right of entry and inspection. It also contains provisions authorizing EPA to delegate
this authority to States and, as proposed in today's rule, Tribes.

Section 118 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7418, provides that Federal facilities must comply with all Federal, State and local
air pollution requirements to the same extent as nongovernmental agencies unless expressly exempted by the President.
EPA is proposing to extend this authority to Tribal air pollution requirements.

Financial Assistance.

The provisions governing the issuance of Federal financial assistance to air pollution control agencies are set
out in Title I. CAA sections 103 &amp; 105, 42 U.S.C. 7403 &amp; 7405. The phrase ``air pollution control agency'' for
this purpose is, in turn, defined in CAA section 302(b), 42 U.S.C. 7602(b), and expressly includes ``[a]n agency of
an Indian tribe.'' An ``Indian tribe'' is defined in CAA section 302(r). See discussion below under Title III/Definitions.
Issues associated with the award of Federal financial assistance to Tribes are addressed in more detail in the

Title II_Mobile Sources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Title contains the provisions of the Clean Air Act addressing mobile sources (e.g., automobiles, trucks, off-road
vehicles). It contains provisions addressing motor vehicle emission standards as well as standards for aircraft
and non-road vehicles and engines. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CAA sections 202, 213 &amp; 231, 42 U.S.C. 7521, 7547 &amp; 7571. It also provides for the regulation of motor vehicle
and other fuels, including registration requirements, requirements for new fuels and fuel additives as well as provisions
for reformulated gasoline and low sulfur diesel fuel. CAA section 211, 42 U.S.C. 7545. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant provisions of this Title preempt in whole or in part the issuance of State standards. For example, section
209 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7543, precludes any State or political subdivision from controlling emissions from new motor
vehicles. EPA may waive this prohibition for California, and other States may adopt California standards. CAA sections
209(b) &amp; 177, 42 U.S.C. 7543 &amp; 7507. Similarly, except in limited circumstances, States are precluded from
enforcing controls on motor vehicle fuels that are different from those required by EPA. CAA section 211(c)(4), 42
U.S.C. 7545(c)(4). Therefore, the motor vehicle and fuel requirements in Title II generally are issued and administered
by EPA unless the statute contemplates and a State qualifies for special treatment or waiver of the preemption provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some Title II provisions are administered by the States through the SIP system established under Title I.
For example, States containing certain carbon monoxide and ozone nonattainment areas are required to develop and
submit to EPA for approval a SIP revision establishing a clean-fuel vehicle program for motor vehicle fleets. CAA
section 246, 42 U.S.C. 7586. States containing certain carbon monoxide nonattainment areas are required to develop
and submit to EPA for approval a SIP revision establishing an oxygenated gasoline program. CAA section 211(m), 42
U.S.C. 7545(m). In today's action, EPA is proposing to extend this State-implemented authority to Tribes.

Section 304 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7604, authorizes any person who provides the minimum required advance notice to bring
a civil action against: any person, including any governmental entity or agency, who is in violation of an emission
limit; the Administrator of EPA where he or she fails to carry out a non-discretionary duty under the Clean Air Act or
has unreasonably delayed agency action; any person who proposes to construct or constructs any new or modified major
stationary source without a NSR or PSD permit that meets the requirements of the Act (described previously); and any
person who is alleged to be in violation of such permit. The term ``person'' ``includes an individual, corporation,
partnership, association, State, municipality, political subdivision of a State, and any agency, department,
or instrumentality of the United States and any officer, agent, or employee thereof.'' Section 302(e), 42 U.S.C.
7602(e). The Federal district courts are granted jurisdiction over such legal action. In today's action, EPA is proposing
that Tribes be subject to these provisions in the same manner that States are.

group or community, including any Alaska Native village, which is Federally recognized as eligible for the special
programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.'' CAA section 302(r).

Section 328, 42 U.S.C. 7627, provides for regulation of sources located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore
all the States except Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. These sources must comply with EPA's rule on OCS
requirements, which generally set forth requirements that are the same as the applicable requirements in the corresponding
onshore area that pertain to the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards and to PSD. If States
develop and submit to EPA an adequate program, EPA can delegate implementation and enforcement of these provisions
to States. EPA is proposing to extend such authority to Tribes in today's action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of approximately 10 million tons from 1980 levels from fossil fuel-fired electric utility units. These reductions
are achieved through the purchase and sale of a fixed number of SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``allowances.'' Each allowance entitles the holder to emit one ton of SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Through this emissions trading program, owners of ``affected'' units that can reduce emissions efficiently can
sell excess allowances to owners of units where it is more costly to obtain the required reductions, thereby achieving
emissions reductions in a cost-effective manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acid rain program also calls for reductions in nitrogen oxides of approximately 2 million tons from 1980 levels
from coal-fired electric utility units. These reductions are obtained by requiring affected sources to comply with
certain emission limitations. In many situations, compliance may be demonstrated by averaging the emissions among
different utility units.

The Title IV program is a Federal program during Phase I, from 1995_1999. However, during Phase II, which begins in
the year 2000, States will issue the acid precipitation portion of the operating permits addressed below under Title
V. 42 U.S.C. 7651&hyph;7651o. In today's rule, EPA is proposing to extend this Phase II permitting authority to Tribes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title V calls for the permitting of certain sources by certain deadlines. Operating permits are to contain all of the
Clean Air Act requirements applicable to such sources. The program is intended to promote regulatory certainty and
enforceability. Title V also provides for the collection of fees by the permitting agency that reflect the reasonable
costs of the permit program. 42 U.S.C. 7661&hyph;7661e. EPA has issued rules specifying the minimum requirements
for State permit programs. 57 FR 32,250 (July 21, 1992). EPA is proposing to extend Title V operating permit program
authority to Tribes in today's rule.

Tribes meeting the eligibility criteria of &sect;49.6 shall be treated in the same manner as States with respect to
all provisions of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations, except for those provisions identified in &sect;49.4
and the regulations that implement those provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Clean Air Act provisions inapplicable to Tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following provisions of the Clean Air Act and any implementing regulations are not applicable to Tribes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Specific plan submittal and implementation deadlines for NAAQS-related requirements, including but not limited
to such deadlines in sections 110(a)(1), 172(a)(2), 182, 187, 189, 191 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The specific deadlines associated with the review and revision of implementation plans related to major fuel
burning sources in section 124 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The mandatory imposition of sanctions under section 179 of the Act because of a failure to submit an implementation
plan or required plan element by a specific deadline, or the submittal of an incomplete or disapproved plan or element.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The ``within 2 years'' clause in section 110(c)(1) of the Act. The inapplicability of this specific clause does
not in any way curtail the general authority delegated to the Administrator under section 110(c)(1) to issue a Federal
implementation plan upon the failure of a Tribe to make a required submission, upon a finding that the plan or plan revision
submitted by a Tribe is incomplete or in response to EPA's disapproval of a Tribal implementation plan in whole or in
part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Specific visibility implementation plan submittal deadlines established under section 169A of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Specific implementation plan submittal deadlines related to interstate commissions under sections 169B(e)(2),
184(b)(1) &amp; (c)(5) of the Act. For eligible Tribes participating as members of such Commissions, the Administrator
shall establish those submittal deadlines that are determined to be practicable or, as with other non-participating
Tribes in an affected transport region, provide for Federal implementation of necessary measures. (g) Any provisions
of the Act requiring as a condition of program approval the demonstration of criminal enforcement authority or any
provisions of the Act providing for the delegation of such criminal enforcement authority. Tribes seeking approval
of a Clean Air Act program requiring such demonstration may receive program approval if they meet the requirements
for enforcement authority established under &sect;49.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The specific deadline for the submittal of operating permit programs in section 502(d)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The mandatory imposition of sanctions under section 502(d)(2)(B) because of failure to submit an operating permit
program or EPA disapproval of an operating permit program submittal in whole or part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The ``2 years after the date required for submission of such a program under paragraph (1)'' clause in section 502(d)(3)
of the Act. The inapplicability of this specific clause does not in any way curtail the general authority delegated
to the Administrator under section 502(d)(3) to promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal operating permit program
for a Tribe not having a program that has been approved in whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Section 502(g), which authorizes a limited interim approval of an operating permit program that substantially
meets the requirements of Title V, but is not fully approvable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) The provisions of section 503(c) that direct permitting authorities to establish a phased schedule assuring
that at least one-third of the permit applications submitted within the first full year after the effective date of
an operating permit program (or a partial or interim program) will be acted on by the permitting authority over a period
of not to exceed three years after the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The provisions of section 507(a) that specify a deadline for the submittal of plans for establishing a small business
stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) The provisions of section 507(e) that direct the establishment of a Compliance Advisory Panel.

To the extent that an Indian Tribe is precluded from asserting criminal enforcement authority, the Federal government
will exercise primary criminal enforcement responsibility. The Tribe, with the EPA Region, shall develop a procedure
by which the Tribal agency will refer potential criminal violations to the EPA Regional Administrator, as agreed
to by the parties, in an appropriate and timely manner. This procedure shall encompass all circumstances in which
the Tribe is incapable of exercising applicable enforcement requirements as provided in &sect;49.7(a)(6). This

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 30 days of receipt of an Indian Tribe's initial, complete application, the EPA Regional Administrator
shall notify all appropriate governmental entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For Tribal applications addressing air resources within the exterior boundaries of the Reservation, EPA's notification
of other governmental entities shall specify the geographic boundaries of the Reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For Tribal applications addressing off-reservation areas, EPA's notification of other governmental entities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The governmental entities shall have 15 days to provide written comments to EPA's Regional Administrator regarding
any dispute concerning the boundary of the Reservation. Where a Tribe has asserted jurisdiction over off-reservation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In all cases, comments must be timely, limited to the scope of the Tribe's jurisdictional assertion, and clearly

the EPA Regional Administrator may request additional information and may consult with the Department of the Interior.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The EPA Regional Administrator shall decide the scope of the Tribe's jurisdiction. If a conflicting claim cannot

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to reinstate as SFAR 62&hyph;1 and modify expired Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)
No. 62, which suspended certain provisions of the regulations that require the installation and use of automatic
altitude reporting (Mode C) transponders. On December 5, 1990, the FAA published SFAR No. 62, which suspended the
Mode C transponder requirement for certain operations to and from specific outlying airports located within 30 miles
of a terminal control area (Class B airspace area) primary airport (the Mode C Veil). The operations and routings specified
in SFAR No. 62 included operations within a 2 nautical mile radius of the designated airports and along a direct route
between those airports and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil. No airports were excluded from the Mode C transponder
requirement if those airports were primarily served by aircraft required to install and operate Traffic Alert and
Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS). SFAR No. 62 was issued with an expiration date of December 30, 1993, to allow sufficient
time to upgrade ATC radar systems at the Class B airspace areas listed in the SFAR. Scheduled radar system upgrades
have not been completed and operationally assessed in all of the Class B airspace areas. This notice proposes to reinstate
the previous exclusions at those Class B airspace areas that have not attained improved radar coverage, amend the
list of exempted airports affected by the movement of the Denver Class B airspace and Mode C veil associated with the
closing of the Stapleton International Airport and opening of the Denver International Airport, Denver CO, and reinstate
and amend the previous exclusions in the 4 Class B airspace areas that have attained improved radar coverage.

On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91&hyph;78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782),
which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's). On June 21, 1988, the FAA published the Mode
C final rule (53 FR 23356). The Mode C rule requires, in part, that aircraft operating within 30 miles of a Class B airspace
area (formerly known as TCA) primary airport (the Mode C veil) to be equipped with an operable Mode C transponder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 17, 1991, the FAA published the airspace reclassification final rule (56 FR 65638). Specifically applicable
to this NPRM is the reclassification of TCA airspace into Class B airspace, effective September 16, 1993. Nevertheless,
the FAA did not modify any of the Mode C veils under the airspace reclassification final rule.

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As a result of regulatory proceedings initiated under Notice 88&hyph;2 (53 FR 4306, February 12, 1988), no person
may operate an aircraft in the Mode C veil unless that aircraft is equipped with an operable Mode C transponder. However,
aircraft otherwise authorized or directed by ATC; aircraft not originally certificated with an engine-driven electrical
system or not subsequently certified with such a system installed; balloons; and gliders are excluded from the Mode
C requirement in the veil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to over 65,000 comments received to Notice 88&hyph;2, the FAA stated that it would consider a means of providing
access to outlying airports within the Mode C veil for those aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder;
and that access would be allowed only to the extent that operations without an operable Mode C transponder would be
consistent with maintaining adequate safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SFAR No. 62 was proposed (55 FR 21722; May 25, 1990) to permit the operation of aircraft to and from designated airports
within the Mode C veil without an operable Mode C transponder. When SFAR No. 62 was adopted (55 FR 50302; December 5,
1990), the FAA designated 306 airports, within 24 Mode C veils, at which the Mode C requirement would be suspended.
SFAR No. 62 allowed for the operation of aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder in the airspace at
or below the altitude specified for the airport and within 2-nautical miles of the center of the airport or along the
most direct and expeditious routing (or on a routing directed by ATC) between that airport and the outer boundary of
the Mode C veil, consistent with established traffic patterns, noise abatement procedures, and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the adoption of SFAR No. 62, any requests to deviate from the Mode C transponder requirements were handled
by ATC facilities on a case-by-case basis. If approved, the ATC authorization specified all restrictions or conditions
necessary to ensure that the operation could be conducted safely, without any impact on other operations. Although
there were circumstances that were applicable to many operators (such as operations to and from a specified outlying
airport or operations conducted in areas of no radar coverage), ATC authorizations had to be requested and granted
on an individual basis. This aspect of the ATC authorization process proved to be inefficient and time consuming for
both operators and ATC staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The promulgation of SFAR No. 62 proved to be beneficial for the affected aircraft and ATC, in that it provided access
to outlying airports with a minimum of ATC involvement without degrading the safety benefits of the Mode C rule. The
3-year duration of SFAR No. 62 was expected to allow for the completion or ATC radar system upgrades at each Class B airspace
area primary airport. An operational evaluation was to be completed to determine the extent of the improved radar
coverage within each Mode C veil achieved as a result of the radar system upgrades. It was anticipated that if extensions
to the suspension of the Mode C transponder requirement for operations at certain airports were required, each extension
would be addressed on a site-by-site basis. During the period that SFAR No. 62 was in effect, no known violations or
derogations of safety were known to have occurred and no complaints were received by the FAA. Consequently, the FAA
still believes, as stated in the original promulgation of SFAR No. 62, that the operation of an aircraft not equipped
with a Mode C transponder within the Mode C veil can be accommodated safely, provided the operations are conducted
outside ATC radar coverage, and are consistent with the restrictions delineated in the expired SFAR No. 62.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In support of the FAA's General Aviation Action Plan, which in part promotes increased access to airspace and eliminating
unneeded equipment requirements for General Aviation (GA) aircraft, this notice proposes to reinstate and amend
the former SFAR No. 62. This proposal will permit the operation of aircraft, without an operable Mode C transponder,
in the airspace at or below the specified altitude and within a 2-nautical mile radius, or, if directed by ATC, within
a 5-nautical mile radius, of an airport listed in section 2 of the SFAR; and in the airspace at or below the specified
altitude along the most direct and expeditious routing, or on routing directed by ATC, between an airport listed in
section 2 of this SFAR and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil overlying that airport, consistent with established
traffic patterns, noise abatement procedures and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed SFAR and the amended altitude designations for each airport would not supersede the provisions of &sect;91.119,
minimum safe altitudes. Routings to and from each airport are intentionally unspecified to permit the pilot to avoid
operating near obstructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of the date of this notice, only 10 of the 24 Mode C veils have commissioned the new radar systems. This notice proposes
to reinstate, without change, the exclusions previously afforded to airports associated with the 14 Mode C veils
that have not commissioned the new radar systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has conducted operational evaluations of the 10 sites that have commissioned the new radar systems to determine
the extent of attained radar coverage improvement. Of the 10 sites evaluated, 6 experienced no increase in radar coverage
at the altitudes and routing previously approved under SFAR No. 62. The FAA proposes to reinstate the exclusions formerly
provided for by SFAR No. 62 at these 6 sites without change. Four sites have experienced improvement in radar coverage,
and this notice proposes the following changes to the altitudes at which operations by aircraft not equipped with
an operable Mode C transponder can be accommodated at those sites:

Upon expiration of the proposed SFAR, [Insert date 3 years after date of publication of the final rule], the Mode C transponder
requirement would become effective for aircraft operations to and from the designated airports. However, during
the effective period of the SFAR, the FAA will continue to conduct field evaluations, as the remaining Class B airspace
areas receive and commission the new radar systems, to reassess the radar coverage within the associated Mode C veil.
Additionally, the FAA will explore the feasibility of making permanent exclusions based on safety, operational
impact, and radar coverage. The public will be invited to provide comment on any such proposals through further notice

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When SFAR No. 62 was adopted (December 1990), the FAA designated 306 airports located within the 24 Class B airspace
Mode C veils at which the Mode C requirement would be temporarily suspended. SFAR No. 62 allowed aircraft operations
into and out of these designated airports without an operable Mode C transponder if these operations were conducted
at and below the altitude specified, within 2-nautical miles from the airport's center, and along a direct route (or
as directed by ATC) between that airport and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil. In this evaluation, the term ``Designated
Airports'' refers to those outlying airports located within the 24 Class B airspace areas Mode C veils where local
airport operations were beyond or below ATC radar coverage and, as such, were temporarily suspended from Mode C requirements
by the forerunner of this SFAR.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits in the form of: (1) Increased convenience to pilots
operating aircraft not equipped with operable Mode C transponders, and (2) enhanced operational efficiency to FAA
air traffic control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to SFAR No. 62, aircraft not equipped with operable Mode C transponders could operate at an airport within a Mode
C veil only after receiving ATC authorization. This requirement was valid at all airports within the Mode C veil, even
those airports that were located beyond existing ATC radar coverage. Because ATC authorization can only be granted
on a case-by-case basis, the process of obtaining ATC authorization can be inefficient and time consuming for pilots,
as well as the FAA. The benefit of this proposed rule would be temporary relief from the burden of obtaining individual
ATC authorizations for those aircraft operations at airports located beyond existing radar coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For FAA air traffic control, this proposed rule would provide benefits in the form of enhanced operational efficiency.
Such enhanced efficiency would be the temporary relief of ATC from assigning authorizations, particularly during
busy periods. This proposed rule would allow TAC to allocate temporarily its personnel and equipment resources to
more productive functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the benefits of this proposed rule have not been quantified, they are expected to be large for both aircraft
operators and the FAA.

Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not expected to impose costs on the FAA or society. In addition, this proposed rule would not impose
significant costs on the aviation community (namely, fixed based operators).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would not impose additional equipment or personnel costs to the FAA. The acquisition of new radar
tracking systems is a routine cost of upgrading FAA equipment. No additional FAA personnel would be required, because
the temporary suspension of the Mode C transponder requirement is expected to enhance air traffic control (ATC) operational
efficiency by eliminating the need for ATC authorizations at the designated airports. This proposed rule would reduce
the demand on ATC equipment and personnel resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule is not expected to impose societal costs, in the form of reduced aviation safety. When the FAA initially
published SFAR No. 62, which temporarily suspended the Mode C requirements at the Designated Airports, it did so on
the basis that there was no ATC radar coverage at those Designated Airports. The regulatory evaluation prepared for
that final rule concluded that there would not be any adverse impact on aviation safety, because the full intent of
the Mode C rule had not been realized. Furthermore, such safety would not be realized until ATC radar coverage was extended
to those designated airports, through the installation of the new ASR&hyph;9 radar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the implementation of SFAR No. 62, ASR&hyph;9 radar has been commissioned at 10 of the 24 Class B airspace areas.
Under this proposed rule, aviation safety would not be affected adversely for two reasons. First, operations at those
designated airports located within the Mode C veils of the 14 Class B airspace areas not utilizing the ASR&hyph;9 radar
would be temporarily excluded from the Mode C requirements. Second, operations at those designated airports, located
within the Mode C veils of the 10 Class B airspace areas now equipped with ASR&hyph;9 radar, would be subject to the requirements
of the Mode C rule when conducted within that associated airspace covered by the extended ASR&hyph;9 radar coverage.
Operations conducted at those same airports, but below the areas of ASR&hyph;9 radar coverage, would be exempt from
the Mode C rule. The areas not covered by the ASR&hyph;9 radar would be defined by a specified ceiling altitude and extend
down to the surface. For example, prior to the installation of ASR&hyph;9 radar, radar coverage excluded the airspace
above Airport A, from a ceiling of 2000 feet AGL down to the ground. As the result of the installation of ASR&hyph;9 radar,
the airspace above Airport A, which is not excluded from the enhanced ATC coverage, is from a ceiling of 1000 feet AGL
down to the ground. Under this proposed rule, operations below 1000 feet AGL would be temporarily excluded from the
Mode C requirements, since operations below the altitude of 1000 feet AGL are beyond ATC radar coverage. Thus, the
FAA contends that access to certain outlying airports by aircraft without Mode C transponders can be accommodated
without diminishing Mode C safety benefits, provided the operation is conducted outside radar coverage. When aircraft
operations are confined exclusively to areas of no radar coverage, many of the safety benefits of the Mode C rule cannot
be realized. Further enhancement of the radar tracking system is expected to increase radar coverage, thus extending
the Mode C benefits to more areas outside of the current radar coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the aviation community, the FAA anticipates that this proposed rule would impose no significant costs on fixed
base operators (FBO's). FBO's represent the most likely group to incur potential costs. When the FAA evaluated the
potential cost impact of SFAR No. 62 on FBO's, it did so on the increased likelihood that some general aviation (GA)
aircraft operators (without Mode C transponders) would relocate to airports outside of the Mode C veil from airports
inside of the Mode C veil. If this relocation activity had materialized, FBO's inside of the Mode C veil would have incurred
lost revenues from decreases in demand for mechanical repairs and related activities from some GA aircraft operators.
After SFAR No. 62 was issued as a notice, the FAA did not receive any comments from FBO's with regard to cost impacts.
Therefore, with no cost impact comments received on SFAR No. 62, this evaluation concludes that the proposed rule
would not have any significant cost impact on any FBO's.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not expected to impose costs on either the FAA or society. In addition, this proposed rule would
not impose any significant costs on the aviation community (FBO's). The FAA estimates that this proposed rule would
generate benefits in the form of increased convenience to some GA aircraft operators and increased operational efficiency
to FAA air traffic control. Thus, the FAA contends that this proposed rule is cost-beneficial.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The types of small entities that could be potentially affected
by the implementation of the proposed rule are air taxi operators and FBOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of air taxi operators, no cost impacts are anticipated by this proposed rule. This assessment is based on the
FAA's estimation that these operators are already equipped with Mode C transponders. They are, in all likelihood,
based at airports within the Mode C veil which fall within the radar coverage of ATC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of FBO's, the FAA estimates that this proposed rule would not impose significant costs. This assessment is
based on the belief that FBO's would not experience revenue losses from GA aircraft to airports outside of the Mode
C veil or undesignated airports within the Mode C veil to designated airports specified in this proposed rule. Although
the proposed rule provides access to a Mode C veil, the FAA believes that this proposed rule does not provide GA aircraft
operators with much of an incentive to relocate. This assessment is further supported by the belief that the vast majority
of those GA aircraft operators required to install Mode C transponders acquired them by December 30, 1990 (Phase II
of the Mode C rule for Airport Radar Service Areas). Therefore, the FAA contends that a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required because this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on substantial number of small
entities.

International Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would not have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor would not have an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This proposed rule would
neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor aircraft manufacturers (U.S. or foreign) that would result in a competitive
disadvantage to either. The proposed rule may impose insignificant costs on FBO's in the United States. However,
FBO's in the U.S. do not compete directly with FBO's in foreign countries. Therefore, no competitive trade disadvantage
is expected to impact FBO's.

This proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined that this proposed
rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Assessment, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. In addition the FAA certifies that this proposed regulation, if
adopted, would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Order
2100.5, Policies and Procedures for Simplication, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. An initial Regulatory Flexibility
Determination and International Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 30, 1987, the Bureau published proposed Adult Education Program rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. These regulations are being re-proposed because of the considerable passage of time since that publication. In
January, 1991, the Bureau conducted consultation meetings with tribes, parents, school boards, and other interested
parties concerning the Adult Education Program regulations. Oral testimony and written statements were received
in the Office of Indian Education Programs until February 26, 1991. The Bureau considered the comments, objections,
and suggested changes received in response to the 1987 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication and the 1991 consultation meetings in re-proposing these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is published in exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant
Secretary_Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information and record keeping requirements contained in this rule will be submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The collection of this information will not be required until approved by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the location identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this regulation is a major rule under Executive Order 12866 and
therefore will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These regulations will affect only the delivery of adult education services to eligible individual Indian adults.
They will not have an impact on small entities as defined in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant
takings implications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary author of this document is Mr. Harvey Jacobs, Education Specialist, Branch of Post Secondary Education,
Office of Indian Education Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eligibility of Indian adults participating in this program is contained within 25 U.S.C. Section 2008(f)(1).
The Bureau feels the definition ``eligible Indian student'' stated in the aforementioned statute should be extended
to Indian adults participating in this program. Comments are especially desired on this section of eligibility.

to educationally disadvantaged Indian adults; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) encourage the establishment of adult education programs that will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) enable Indian adults to acquire the basic educational skills necessary for literate functioning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) provide Indian adults with sufficient basic education to enable them to benefit from job training and retraining
programs and to obtain and retain productive employment so that they might more fully enjoy the benefits and responsibilities
of citizenship; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

school.
