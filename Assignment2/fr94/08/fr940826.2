SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public Law 103&hyph;276, signed by President Clinton on July 5, 1994, requires a filing fee of $60 for each informal
complaint, and a handling fee of $300 for each formal complaint filed under Section 6(a) of the PACA (7 U.S.C. 499f(a))
during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Therefore, a $60 fee must accompany each informal complaint filed on or after October
1, 1994, through September 30, 1996, before it will be considered a valid complaint, processed, and investigated
by the agency. Informal complaints received without the fee will not toll the nine-month statute of limitations set
by Section 6(a) (7 U.S.C. 499f(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 7 CFR 47.3 of the Rules of Practice under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930, upon receipt
of the informal complaint and the filing fee, the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) will cause such an investigation to be made as, in his or her opinion, is justified by the facts.
If such investigation reveals that no violation of the act has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person
filing the informal complaint shall be so informed. In the alternative, pursuant to 7 CFR &sect;47.3(b)(2), the Director
may attempt to effect an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter. If this attempt fails, the complainant may
elect to proceed with a formal complaint pursuant to 7 CFR 47.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the filing fee, the complainant must submit a handling fee of $300 at the time of filing a formal complaint.
A copy of the formal complaint will not be served on the respondent until the $300 handling fee is paid. Counterclaims
filed under the PACA are considered new formal complaints and must be accompanied by the $300 handling fee before they
will be considered filed and served on the opposing party. In determining the amount of damages incurred by an injured
party, the Secretary will include the amount of the handling fee as additional damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All payment instruments for fees shall be made payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and shall be deposited
by the Agency into the account of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Fund. Filing of both informal and formal
complaints will continue to be accomplished by providing the informal or formal complaint, accompanied by the appropriate
fee, to the Director of the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the AMS as prescribed in 7 CFR &sect;47.3 and &sect;47.6
of the Rules of Practice under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Delivery of the complaint and fee to a
regional office of the PACA Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division is deemed to be delivery to the Director of the
Fruit and Vegetable Division. If a payment instrument is dishonored, the complainant will be allowed seven days to
replace it with a cashier's check or a certified check or the complaint proceedings will be terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Government has been notified that the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS), predecessor to the Technical
Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a new international organization
created by the Chemical Weapons Convention, is beginning the process of procuring inspection equipment for the evaluation
and use in training of inspectors. The PTS has requested that by October 1, 1994, each Member State identify companies
interested in bidding for contracts to provide such equipment. Upon receipt of names of interested companies, the
PTS will compile an initial tender list for each type of equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this information could be considered commercially sensitive, all responses will be classified as confidential
by the PTS and will be treated accordingly. Only the names and addresses of interested companies will be made available
to Member States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested companies must answer a questionnaire providing company and production information and return it to
the PTS in The Hague, The Netherlands, by October 1, 1994. Packages containing the questionnaire and specific information
about equipment needed by the PTS can be obtained by contacting ACDA at the address below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Census Bureau will be the sole user of the information collected, and will use it to determine the reference sources
that are the most complete and up to date, vis-a-vis streets and addresses, for each geographic area, typically a county
or place. The identification and acquisition of complete and current reference sources are necessary for updating
the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) data base and creating the Master Address
File (MAF) so that the Census Bureau can use the TIGER data base to assign each structure number-street name address
in the MAF to the correct geographic location. The TIGER data base is a nationwide geographic data base that is used
for producing maps, organizing addresses, and tabulating statistical data. The MAF will be a permanent and continuously
maintained nationwide inventory of housing unit addresses to meet the needs of the Census Bureau's statistical programs.
The TIGER data base and the MAF are two critical components of the infrastructure to support the 2000 decennial census,
and the success of that census depends, to a great extent, on their completeness and currency.

PRELIMINARY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES DETERMINATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (the Department) published its preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value
in this investigation on June 16, 1994 (54 FR 30911). On July 22, 1994, petitioner in this investigation alleged that
there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain
cased pencils from the People's Republic of China (PRC). On August 1, 1994, petitioner amended the original allegation,
submitting additional information regarding the existence of critical circumstances in this investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2)(ii), since this allegation was filed later than 20 days before the scheduled
date of the preliminary determination, we must issue our preliminary critical circumstances determination not
later than 30 days after the allegation was submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 733(e)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), provides that the Department will determine that
there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than is fair value, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over

In this investigation, the first criterion of analysis is addressed in petitioner's July 22, 1994, submission. This
submission provides documentation indicating that in April 1994 the government of Mexico published an antidumping
duty order of 451 percent on certain cased pencils produced and exported from the PRC. Therefore, petitioner has established
that there is a history of dumping elsewhere of such pencils by PRC producers/exporters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the alternative first criterion, we have consistently determined that preliminary antidumping
duty margins in excess of 25 percent on U.S. purchase price sales are sufficient to impute importer knowledge of sales
at less than fair value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(57 FR 38465, August 25, 1992). In this investigation, all responding and non-responding companies received preliminary
antidumping duty margins in excess of 25 percent. Therefore, we determine that importers either knew or should have
known that the exporter was selling certain cased pencils at less than fair value.

Massive Imports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we have preliminarily found that the first statutory criterion is met for finding critical circumstances
in that there is a history of dumping of the subject merchandise and, alternatively, there is actual or imputed importer
knowledge of sales at less than fair value, we must consider the second statutory criterion: whether imports of the
merchandise have been massive over a relatively short period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to 19 CFR 353.16(f) and 353.16(g), we consider the following to determine whether imports have been massive
over a relatively short period of time: (1) Volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and
(3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When examining volume and value data, the Department typically compares the export volume for equal periods immediately
preceding and following the filing of the petition. Under 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2), unless the imports in the comparison
period have increased by at least 15 percent over the imports during the base period, we will not consider the imports
to have been ``massive.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether there have been massive imports over a relatively short period of time, the Department examines
shipment information submitted by the respondent or import statistics, when respondent-specific shipment information
is not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 4, 1994, the Department sent letters to respondents requesting information regarding shipments of certain
cased pencils for the period January 1992 to May 1994. On August 16, 1994, we received the requested information filed
in proper form for each of the four responding companies. Because company-specific shipment data was provided by
the four responding companies in this investigation, we have used this data for our analysis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether or not there have been massive imports of certain cased pencils over a relatively short period,
we compared each respondent's export volume for the seven months subsequent to the filing of the petition (November
1993 through May 1994) to that during the seven months prior to the filing of the petition (April through October 1993).
This period of review was selected based on the Department's practice of using the longest period for which information
is available from the month that the petition was filed through the effective date of the preliminary determination
of sales at less than fair value, which in this investigation was June 16, 1994.

of China
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16795, April 8, 1994). We were unable to consider the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports,
pursuant to &sect;353.16(f)(1)(iii), because the available data did not permit such a post-filing analysis. In
addition, we found no evidence of seasonality, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f)(1)(ii), with respect to PRC exports of
certain cased pencils to the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on respondents' shipment information, we find that imports of certain cased pencils from the PRC have been massive
over a relatively short period for the following companies: Shanghai Foreign Trade Corporation (SFTC), Shanghai
Lansheng, Co., Ltd. (SLC), and China First Pencil Co., Ltd. (CFP). In addition, we find that imports from Guangdong
Stationery &amp; Sporting Goods I/E Corporation (GSSG), the other respondent in this investigation, have not been
massive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, because there is a history of dumping, and, alternatively, importers knew or should have known that the
exporters were selling the merchandise at less than its fair value, and because imports of certain cased pencils have
been massive over a relatively short period of time, we preliminarily determine that there is a reasonable basis to
believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain cased pencils from SFTC,
SLC, and CFP. Because imports from GSSG have not been massive, we preliminarily determine that there is not a reasonable
basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of certain cased pencils from
GSSG. In addition, with respect to all non-responding procedures/exporters of certain cased pencils from the PRC,
we preliminarily determine, as best information available, that critical circumstances exist.

Postponement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued affirmative preliminary determinations in
the antidumping duty investigations of stainless steel bar (SSB) from Japan (59 FR 39739, August 4, 1994) and Brazil
(59 FR 39732, August 4, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 26, 1994, Daido Steel Co., Ltd. (Daido); Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. (Aichi); Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. (Sanyo)
(the three respondents in the Japanese investigation); Abe Bright Shaft Mfg. Co., Ltd.; Pacific Metals Co., Ltd.;
Tohoku Steel Co., Ltd.; Yamashin Steel Co., Ltd.; and Kansai Metal Industry Co., Ltd. (other Japanese exporters),
requested that the Department postpone the final determination in the Japanese investigation until 135 days after
the publication date of the preliminary determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1673d(a)(2)(A)).
Daido, Aichi, and Sanyo are Japanese exporters which accounted for a significant portion of exports of the subject
merchandise to the United States. On July 26, 1994, Acos Villares, S.A. (the Brazilian respondent), an exporter which
accounted for a significant portion of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States, requested that the
Department postpone the final determination in the Brazilian investigation until 135 days after the publication
date of the preliminary determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In both of these investigations the respondents requested a postponement in order to permit the Department to align
all of the related SSB investigations on one timetable, and thereby alleviate the administrative burden on all the
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 29 and August 1, 1994, petitioners submitted comments opposing respondents' request for a postponement of
the final determinations. In those submissions, petitioners claimed they would be adversely affected by a postponement
because importers would have the option of posting a bond in lieu of paying cash deposits of estimated antidumping
duties. Petitioners also asserted that there is no increase in the level of administrative convenience for any of
the parties if the final determinations are postponed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations provide that upon the receipt of a proper request, the Department will postpone the
final determination unless there are compelling reasons to deny the request (19 CFR 353.20(b)(1) (1994)). After
considering the respondents' and petitioners' comments, we find that petitioners will not be adversely affected
by a postponement of the final determinations. The preliminary results have already been issued and suspension of
liquidation is already in effect. In addition, several of the SSB investigations have already been postponed. Given
the complexity of these investigations as a whole, and the resulting increased burden on the Department to review
and analyze the documents submitted in these investigations, aligning all the SSB investigations will ease the administrative
burden on the Department. Therefore, in the context of these investigations, we have determined that the fact that
respondents will be able to post a bond in lieu of paying an actual cash deposit for a slightly longer period does not
rise to a compelling reason for denying the respondents' requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are postponing the final determinations on Japan and Brazil to the full extent authorized under section
735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act. The final determinations will be issued not later than December 19, 1994, which is
the due date for the previously extended investigations of SSB from India, Spain, and Italy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments must be submitted in at least ten copies to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November
15, 1994. In addition, a public version and five copies should be submitted by the appropriate date if the submission
contains business proprietary information. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if
requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs.
If requested, hearings are tentatively scheduled on November 17, 1994, at 2:00 p.m. for the Japanese investigation
and on November 17 1994, at 3:00 p.m. for the Brazilian investigation. Both hearings will be held at the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington D.C., 20230. Parties should confirm
by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time.

Decision: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approved. No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for such purposes as these instruments
are intended to be used, was being manufactured in the United States at the time the instruments were ordered. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each foreign instrument is a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM) and is intended for research
or scientific educational uses requiring a CTEM. We know of no CTEM, or any other instrument suited to these purposes,
which was being manufactured in the United States either at the time of order of each instrument or at the time of receipt
of application by the U.S. Customs Service.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 27, 1993, June 24 and July 1, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
published notices (58 FR 68398, 59 FR 32686 and 33958) of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additions to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish

A. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Examination of Records by Comptroller General clause and the two audit clauses, Audit_Negotiation and Audit_Formal
Advertising, implement the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2313, 41 U.S.C. 254, and 10 U.S.C. 2306. The statutory requirements
are that the Comptroller General and/or agency shall have access to, and the right to, examine certain books, documents
and records of the contractor for a period of 3 years after final payment. The record retention periods required of
the contractor in the clauses are for compliance with the aforementioned statutory requirements. The information
must be retained so that audits necessary for contract surveillance, verification of contract pricing, and reimbursement
of contractor costs can be performed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This panel was convened by the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act), 20 U.S.C.
107d&hyph;1(a), upon receipt of a complaint filed by petitioners, Messrs. Gardner, Sadikoff, and Shepherd, on July
22, 1988. The Randolph-Sheppard Act governs the operation of vending facilities by blind vendors on local, State,
and Federal property and provides a priority for blind individuals to operate those facilities on Federal property.
Under this section of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, a blind licensee dissatisfied with the State's operation or administration
of the vending facility program authorized under the Act may request a full evidentiary hearing from the State licensing
agency (SLA). If the licensee is dissatisfied with the State agency's decision, the licensee may file a complaint
with the Secretary, who is then required to convene an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute.

David Gardner, Charles Sadikoff, and Curtis M. Shepherd, complainants, are blind vendors licensed by the respondent,
the Tennessee Department of Human Services, the SLA, pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.
The SLA, through its Department of Rehabilitation, operates the Tennessee Vending Facility Program for blind vendors.
The purpose of the program is to establish and support blind vendors operating vending facilities on Federal property.
As the agency designated in Tennessee to carry out and manage the vending facility program established by the Act,
the SLA duly promulgated rules and regulations to govern the State's program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1985, the SLA's rules and regulations were revised regarding classifications of facility types and the
licensing of vendors. Five categories were established for vending facilities (all vending, counter and vending,
counter service, on-site food preparation, and cafeteria). All of the existing vending facilities were placed into
one of these categories by the SLA and the Committee of Blind Vendors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, all current licensed managers who had received training at the SLA's training center after April 1977
were certified in the type of facility they operated at the time the new rules were implemented. The new rules provided
that, after certification to operate a category of vending facility, the manager was required to attend one training
session at the SLA's training center in Smyrna, Tennessee, within a two-year period following certification and
every two years thereafter in order for the manager to maintain certification. Failure by a vendor to comply with this
rule precluded the manager from assuming a location as the result of a bid on a facility opening.

Also, the rule change required that a manager be certified to operate a particular type of facility in order to obtain
a promotion into that facility by bid or to obtain a transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complainants were notified in January 1986 that each vendor's certification was to be terminated because each
had failed to attend an Upward Mobility Training Session at the SLA's center during the two-year period following
their initial certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each complainant alleged individual circumstances that prohibited them from attendance at a training session.
Also, each complainant asked the SLA to adopt a uniform standard for blind vendors who wanted to use an alternative
method to obtain continuing certification if the manager was unable to attend the SLA's training sessions, which
usually required overnight travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 12, 1988, the complainants jointly filed for an evidentiary hearing, which was held on April 5, 1988, challenging
the SLA's decision not to extend their certifications and requesting that the SLA allow them to show cause why they
were unable to participate in the required training for recertification, as well as allow them to seek an alternative
method of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Shepherd operates a vending facility at the Moccasin Bend Psychiatric Hospital and has done so for approximately
12 years. He alleged at the evidentiary hearing that he was unable to attend training due to constant care of two elderly
aunts who reside with him. However, the SLA had informed Mr. Shepherd in March 1988 that his certification would be
extended due to his personal situation. Mr. Shepherd declined the SLA's offer of certification extension in favor
of an evidentiary hearing, thereby attempting to establish a uniform procedure for exempting any manager from attending
training at the SLA's center if a manager has problems that prohibit attendance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Sadikoff operates a vending facility at the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Mr. Gardner operates a vending facility
at the Memphis Mental Health Institute. Both indicated they did not have confidence in anyone operating their respective
vending locations during the three or four days they would be absent to attend mandatory SLA training for recertification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 3, 1988, the Hearing Officer rendered a decision that was subsequently adopted as final agency action by the
SLA on June 17, 1988. The decision of the Hearing Officer upheld the SLA's extension of Mr. Shepherd's certification
for one year beyond the anticipated expiration due to the medical circumstances of his relatives. The Hearing Officer
indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SLA rules do not allow for a vendor to decline such an extension. The vendor may decline a particular type of certification;
however, once certified to operate a particular type of facility, an extension of that certification is solely within
the purview of the SLA. Also, the Hearing Officer ruled that the termination of both Mr. Sadikoff's and Mr. Gardner's
certification was upheld. The evidence provided at the hearing clearly showed that neither vendor made any real effort
during a two-year period following their current certification to attend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a training session for recertification nor was a valid reason given for not complying with the SLA requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complainants expressed dissatisfaction with the final agency action and filed a request for a Federal arbitration
panel to be convened. An arbitration hearing was held on February 12, 1990.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central issue addressed by the arbitration panel was whether the State licensing agency can require retraining
of licensed vendors at a specific rehabilitation center within the State in order to retain vendor certification
to operate facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel in a majority opinion dismissed Mr. Gardner's complaint as moot because the parties agreed that he subsequently
attended and completed the required four-day training course in Smyrna, thus complying with the SLA's requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the arbitration panel concurred with the SLA's position of allowing complainant Sadikoff to continue to operate
his current facility but declaring him ineligible for promotion, transfer, or demotion due to his refusal to take
the required training. Complainant Sadikoff indicated his inability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find a person he could trust to manage his facility as the major factor in not completing the required training at Smyrna.
The panel found this position to be unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel further ruled that the SLA acted properly in requiring Mr. Shepherd to attend upward mobility training and,
further, acted properly and within its scope of authority in granting the extension of time for Mr. Shepherd to attend
a training session. The panel member designated by the com- plainants dissented. That panel member interpreted the
Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;4, and the regulations in 34 CFR 395.11 as requiring the SLA to provide training to licensed blind
vendors and to make accommodations for those blind vendors who are unable to attend a regularly scheduled training
session.

State of Nebraska, Department of Public Institutions, Division of Rehabilitative Services (Docket No. R&hyph;S/90&hyph;3).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This panel was convened by the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(a) upon receipt of the original
complaint filed by petitioner Fred Scarpello on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 2, 1990, and subsequently amended on June 3, 1991. The Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act) creates a priority
for blind individuals to operate vending facilities on Federal property. Under the Act, a blind licensee dissatisfied
with the State's operation or administration of the vending facility program authorized under the Act may request
a full evidentiary hearing from the State licensing agency (SLA). If the licensee is dissatisfied with the State agency's
decision, the licensee may complain to the Secretary, who is then required to convene an arbitration panel to resolve
the dispute.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 107d-2(c) of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, the Secretary publishes a synopsis of arbitration panel
decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complainant, Fred V. Scarpello, is a blind vendor licensed by the Nebraska Department of Public Institutions,
the SLA under the provisions of the Act. Pursuant to a permit approved in 1978 by the U.S. Postal Service and a vendor
operator's agreement between Mr. Scarpello and the SLA, Mr. Scarpello operates a vending facility on the second floor
of the Main Post Office, 1124 Pacific Street, Omaha, Nebraska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the SLA submitted two applications for permits for the second floor of the Main Post Office. One permit covered
the operation of a ``snack bar facility,'' and attachment ``C'' to that application specified the items to be sold
as ``hot foods and salads.'' The other permit represented an updated permit and covered the items that Mr. Scarpello
was in fact already vending under his current vending agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SLA granted the complainant's request for an evidentiary hearing. The issues that Mr. Scarpello wanted the arbitration
panel to address were whether the SLA was splitting his location into two separate locations with separate permits
that would allow for another vendor, and if that were the case, whether he would be entitled to have the additional location
and permit automatically awarded to him. The State hearing officer ruled that the two permits already had been issued
and that the complainant was not jeopardized by the new permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July, 1990, Mr. Scarpello filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the State of Nebraska against the Director
of the SLA and the U.S. Postal Service requesting that construction and remodeling of the new facilities be halted.
This suit resulted in a settlement agreement and a dismissal of the action without prejudice on September 21, 1990.
The settlement agreement permitted the Postal Service to proceed with planned construction and remodeling of the
second floor lunchroom pursuant to the two permits that already had been approved. However, the parties agreed that
the hot food line would not be implemented pending the outcome of the arbitration panel decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Arbitration Panel Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The arbitration panel ruled that the SLA, by entering into a vending agreement with the Postal Service to provide hot
food service, did not violate the vending agreement between the SLA and Mr. Scarpello and that complainant's license
was not being compromised. The new permit for the second facility described the facility as a ``Snack Bar Facility,''
and the attachments to the Hot Food Permit made it clear that the services provided were different from the complainant's
1978 permit that was being updated. The SLA's decision to move, remodel, and enlarge the location and size of the food
facilities on the second floor of the Main Post Office was in response to requests from postal employees to have an expanded
dining area and to have served hot food different from the vended food that was available. The decision to offer hot
foods and salads also meant that different equipment and facility design would be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel rejected complainant's argument that he should be the vendor involved in any vending agreement issued pursuant
to the ``Hot Food Permit'' because it would reduce his income and provide unfair competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel ruled that the Hot Food Permit did not provide for a facility similar to that of complainant and that there
is nothing in the Randolph-Sheppard Act or regulations that prohibits competition among blind vendors. The panel
considered that, if the SLA were to have proposed entering into an agreement to provide an identical facility as complainant's,
a different issue would be involved. Accordingly, the panel held that the SLA could enter into a vending agreement
with another blind licensee pursuant to the ``Hot Food Permit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One panel member dissented, arguing that complainant's original permit and agreement allowed him to serve hot food
and to sell and serve salads prepared off the premises and sold over his counter and from the vending machines. This
panel member believed that any change in the permit should have included a discussion and concurrence by the Committee
of Blind Vendors pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107(b)(l)(2). This panel member stated that the permit for ``hot food'' service
was in violation of the vending agreement between the SLA and the complainant and that entering into another vending
agreement with a vendor other than Mr. Scarpello violated the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Complainant Scarpello filed a motion in U.S. District Court for the State of Nebraska on August 14, 1992, seeking judicial
review of the panel's decision. The court ruled in an opinion dated June 13, 1994, that plaintiff (Scarpello) failed
to show that the ``arbitration panel's decision was arbitrary and capricious and insupportable on any rational basis.''
The District Court found that the evidence supported the panel's ruling that Mr. Scarpello's vending permit did not
include ``hot food and salads'' and that his permit was not being split as the result of the SLA receiving a second permit
for another vending location at the same site as plaintiff. Likewise, the court found that the evidence supported
the panel's conclusion that the new permit did not threaten plaintiff's livelihood. The District Court ruled that
plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed and that the arbitration panel decision should be affirmed.

being funded by DOE or another federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse
effect on continuity or completion of the activity, AL gives notice of its intent to renew its current grant with Princeton
University under the project entitled ``Multi-Dimensional Measurements and Computations of Engine Flows and Combustion.''
The public purpose to be served by this renewal is to integrate the understanding of fuel injection processes and the
fluid mechanics of combustion into current multi-dimensional models. Research in this program includes the development
and testing of detailed spray models and the use of practical engines and injectors. The research is a continuation
of work performed by Princeton under its current grant with DOE. The renewal period will be for four years. The government's
funding of this grant is subject to the availability of funds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of a draft supplemental environmental impact statement
(SEIS) for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082&hyph;S&hyph;D) at the Savannah River Site,
Aiken, South Carolina. The document supplements an EIS that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082) to construct
and operate the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The draft SEIS assesses the potential environmental impacts
of completing and operating the DWPF, as modified since 1982, to immobilize high-level radioactive waste at the Savannah
River Site by incorporating the waste into borosilicate glass by a process called vitrification. The draft SEIS also
addresses the potential impacts of no action and of alternative pretreatment processes for the waste. DOE invites
public comments on the draft SEIS, and will hold public hearings on the document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE proposes to conduct various activities within floodplains and wetlands on and surrounding the Pantex Plant.
Site characterization activities would be conducted in support of the Permit for Industrial Solid Waste Management
Site issued by the Texas Water Commission (now known as the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission) as part
of DOE's effort to determine the nature and extent of any environmental contamination resulting from Pantex operations.
These activities would occur within Solid Waste Management Units (SWMU) 6 (Playa Basin 1), SWMU 7 (Playa Basin 2),
SWMU 8 (Playa Basin 3), SWMU 9 (Playa Basin 4), and SWMU 10 (Pantex Lake). Additional characterization may be required
as a result of the site being listed on the National Priorities List. Specific activities would include but not be limited
to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1&blank;Installation of monitoring wells. Monitoring wells would be drilled into the perched groundwater zone
if found to be present in the proposed locations. If the perched groundwater is not present, wells may be completed
into the High Plains Aquifer (locally known as the Ogallala Aquifer). Well drilling would involve limited driving
of heavy equipment into the proposed areas for the purpose of drilling and boring. Twenty-four-hour pump tests would
be conducted following completion of any monitoring wells. Water produced from any pump tests would be discharged
to the playas if the analytical testing results allow for such disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2&blank;Surface water samples, ditch sediment samples, and vadose zone samples. Surface water sampling would
consist of collecting a sample bottle for surface water. Site access would be by wading. Sediment sampling would consist
of taking a sample of the sediment with a hand auger or with a vibrating core sampling device. The sediment samples would
typically be two inches in diameter and one foot deep. Access would be by walking or wading if water is present. Proposed
boreholes for vadose zone samples would include borings ranging in depths from 4 feet to 30 feet. Borehole drilling
would involve driving a drilling rig to the site, drilling the boreholes, and collecting the core samples as the drilling
progresses. The boreholes would be closed by backfilling with the cuttings and/or five percent bentonite/cement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.3&blank;Environmental monitoring and surveillance activities. DOE would conduct activities including: collection
of groundwater, surface water, vegetation, soil, and sediment samples, installation and maintenance of environmental
monitoring equipment, and routine monitoring and downloading of information from installed instrumentation in
various locations within the wetlands and floodplains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, DOE would continue to discharge industrial and storm water from existing outfalls to Playas 1, 2, and
4; discharge storm water to Playa 3, and discharge treated domestic wastewater to Playa 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE proposes to assess any floodplains/wetlands impacts associated with Texas Tech University's agricultural
operations including grazing in the wetlands and floodplains, and farming and related activities in the floodplains.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR Part 1022), DOE will prepare a floodplain/wetland assessment for these proposed DOE actions which may be incorporated
into the appropriate National Environmental Policy Act documentation. After DOE issues the assessment, a floodplain
statement of findings will be published in the

Section 3131 of the Act (42USC7274d(6)), enacted on December 5, 1991, addresses the issue of worker training at nuclear
weapons facilities. Subsection (a) provides for the awarding of grants to train workers and to develop training curricula.
Subsection (b) provides for the assessment of civil penalties against any DOE contractor who fails to provide training
to its employees who are engaged in hazardous substance response or emergency response at DOE nuclear weapons facilities.
Subsection (b) requires that penalties shall be assessed against any contractor who fails to provide the training,
or fails to certify to DOE that its employees are adequately trained for such response pursuant to orders issued by
DOE relating to employee safety training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), Pub. L. No. 91&hyph;596, contractor
employee health and safety protection at DOE nuclear facilities has been exempt from Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) enforcement under section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. This section provides that the OSH Act does
not apply to working conditions of employees if another Federal or state agency exercises statutory authority to
prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health (OSH). DOE, as well as its
predecessor agencies, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration, has
exercised such authority with regard to contractor employees at facilities operated under authority of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 5, 1993, the Secretary of Energy announced a number of safety and health initiatives stressing the need for the
Department to operate on a par with private industry in the safety and health arena. One of those initiatives involved
the commencement of consultations with OSHA with the aim of establishing OSHA regulation of all DOE facilities. The
Secretary recognized, however, that OSHA is not now ready to undertake regulation of DOE activities, and in light
of the significant issues that must be addressed prior to the implementation of OSHA jurisdiction, the Department
anticipates that a transition period of three to five years is necessary. Nonetheless, the Department is currently
obligated to implement the enforcement authority of section 3131(b) of the Act, and intends to do so as an interim measure
pending the transition to OSHA jurisdiction. The Department believes that implementation of this enforcement authority
during the transition period will help to ensure that the training requirements for contractor employees are met.
DOE invites the public to comment on its plans to implement its enforcement authority pursuant to section 3131(b)
of the Act.

Background and Legislative History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131 of the Act contains two substantive provisions aimed at addressing the concern of Congress regarding
the adequacy of worker safety training for employees handling hazardous substances, and responding to emergencies
involving hazardous substances, at the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary
to award grants to nonprofit organizations that have demonstrated (as determined by the Secretary) capabilities
in providing safety and health training and in involving, in training, groups of workers whose duties include hazardous
substance response or emergency response. The Secretary is required to give preference to employee organizations
and joint labor-management training programs that are grant recipients under section 126(g) of the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorization Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 9660a, a program administered by the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences (NIEHS). The Department has entered into an agreement with NIEHS to award and administer the grants
provided under section 3131(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131(b), the subject of this notice, provides that the Secretary shall assess civil penalties of up to $5,000
per day against any DOE contractor who, as determined by the Secretary, fails to provide training for employees engaged
in hazardous substance response or emergency response, or who fails to certify to the Department that its employees
are adequately trained for such response pursuant to DOE orders relating to employee safety training. Because of
this statutory mandate, DOE does not intend to consider a reduction in contractor award fees in lieu of payment of civil
penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is required by section 3131(c) to prescribe regulations for the implementation of these requirements.
The Department intends to proceed with rulemaking after completion of its review of the comments and materials received
in response to this Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131(d) provides that the term ``hazardous substance'' includes both radioactive waste and mixed radioactive
and hazardous waste. The Department intends also to cover substances identified within the definition of hazardous
substance in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601.101(14)). The statute does not define the term ``nuclear weapons facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Certification of Training

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3131 places on the contractor the burden of conducting required training, certifying the completion of such
training, and keeping records to document that the training requirement has been satisfied. In developing its implementing
regulations, DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the following matters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1_DOE intends to make contractors responsible for maintaining all documentation related to the hazardous substance
and emergency response training of their work force. DOE will consider what, if any, data should be kept, and in what
format. DOE's goal will be to provide easy review for DOE field inspectors while minimizing the burden on contractors.
DOE also is considering requiring a wallet-sized photo identification card for each trained employee that would
contain, among other things, the date of refresher training, giving DOE the opportunity to document training in the
field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2_Section 3131 permits DOE contractors to certify that employees have been adequately trained and do not need additional
training. DOE seeks comment on the most effective and efficient way for the employer to certify that employees are
adequately trained especially in those cases where the employer does not actually provide the training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3_One objective of section 3131(b) is to ensure that all employees who are, or may be, engaged in hazardous substance
response or emergency response at the Department's nuclear weapons facilities receive adequate safety training.
DOE has the further objective of ensuring that any enforcement program is structured to provide appropriate incentives
for DOE contractors to comply with DOE requirements applicable to this training, including self-identification,
reporting, and prompt correction of deficiencies. Comments are requested on these objectives and on ways to achieve
these objectives in an effective and efficient manner for both DOE and its contractors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
4_The Department is also developing criteria for assessing the adequacy of contractor training programs for employees
engaged in hazardous substance or emergency response operations. These criteria will be used by DOE field inspectors
to evaluate and certify the adequacy of contractor training programs. DOE seeks comment on the development of appropriate
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5_The Act defines the term ``hazardous substance'' to include radioactive waste and mixed radioactive and hazardous
waste. This definition is not limited, however, to those substances. For purposes of the implementing regulations,
DOE intends to include within the definition of hazardous substance, in addition to radioactive and mixed waste,
those substances identified within the definition of hazardous substance in section 101(14) of CERCLA. DOE seeks
comments on this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6_DOE is considering defining ``nuclear weapons facility'' as follows: ``Any DOE reactor or non-reactor nuclear
facility involved in research, production, assembly, storage, dismantling, or disposal of nuclear weapons, or
material for nuclear weapons, that generates or contains hazardous substances, radioactive waste or mixed radioactive
and hazardous waste.'' Comments are requested on this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7_Comments are requested on the enforcement procedures that are appropriate to assure compliance with the intent
of Congress, including the desirability of integration of the section 3131(b) enforcement procedures with the proposed
DOE program set forth at 10 CFR Part 820, for enforcing violations of nuclear safety requirements which includes assessment
of civil penalties under separate statutory authority, and whether the Department should provide for exemption
from dual civil penalty assessments under both Part 820 and the Act. Comments are also requested on enforcement options
such as varying penalty levels commensurate with the severity of the violation, past performance and multiple violations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE solicits comments on all of these issues and objectives, and on ways to achieve these objectives in an effective
and efficient manner for both DOE and its contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of its review of all comments received and other relevant materials, DOE will develop a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking for publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy in compliance with the provisions of Section 2304 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is developing
a Management Plan for the Conduct of Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application of Energy
Technologies. The Plan is being developed in consultation with the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board that serves
as the Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Advisory Board, as called for in
the Act. The Plan provides an inventory and status report of technologies to enhance energy supply and to improve the
efficiency of energy end uses. The inventory and status report includes fossil, renewable, nuclear, and energy conservation
technologies which have not yet achieved the status of fully reliable and cost-competitive commercial availability,
but which the Secretary projects may become available with additional research, development, and demonstration.
The inventory and status report provides, for each technology_ (1) An assessment of its_ (A) Degree of technological
maturity, (B) principal research, development, and demonstration issues, including_ (i) the barriers posed by
capital, operating, and maintenance costs; (ii) technical performance; and (iii) potential environmental impact;
(2) the projected time frame for commercial availability, specifying at a minimum whether the technology will be
commercially available in the near-term, mid-term, or long-term, whether there are too many uncertainties to project
availability, or whether it is unlikely that the technology will ever be commercial; and (3) a projection of the future
cost-competitiveness of the technology in comparison with alternative technologies to provide the same energy
service.

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Respondents are owners or operators of sources emitting hazardous air pollutants (HAP) who voluntarily seek compliance
extensions for applicable standards through demonstration of early emission reductions, in accordance with the
regulations implementing section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act (see 40 CFR part 63, subpart D). Sources may obtain
a six-year extension of compliance with standards promulgated under section 112(d), if the source demonstrates
achievement of early reduction of HAP by 90 percent (95 percent for particulates), before proposal of an applicable
section 112(d) standard. Industry respondents must submit a one-time demonstration of reductions achieved. State
or local permitting agencies will evaluate these demonstrations for the purpose of granting compliance extensions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that the State of Georgia is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision Primacy
Program. Georgia has adopted drinking water regulations for the Phase V (Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC), Synthetic
Organic Chemicals (SOC), and Inorganic Chemicals (IOC) Rule. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined
that this set of State program revisions is no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations. Therefore,
EPA has tentatively decided to approve this State program revision.

EPA expressed environmental concerns based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential air and water quality impacts. Additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and clarification is needed to: identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent of air quality impacts and their conformity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to SIP requirements for the area; clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical aspects regarding a variance request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of a landfill in a sole source aquifer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA had environmental concerns and requests that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FHWA Record of Decision recognize two major issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the GSA FEIS which FHWA intends to adopt: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the U.S. Congress has not appropriated funding for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment facility at the New River in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calexico and (2) that any future proposal to reverse or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dam the Alamo River to prevent transboundary sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flows into the U.S. would be a major Federal action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the preparation of an EIS or EIS supplement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. The components
of authority and capability were contained in Puerto Rico's application and its revisions. EPA reviewed Puerto Rico's
application, and certain revisions thereto, and on March 23, 1994, proposed a determination that Puerto Rico's MSWLF
permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Puerto Rico's revised regulation
as adopted by the Environmental Quality Board, pursuant to Commonwealth law, is titled the Non-Hazardous Solid Waste
Management Regulation. After consideration of all comments received regarding the tentative determination of
adequacy, EPA is today issuing a final determination that the Commonwealth's program is adequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b)(1) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 8, 1993, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico submitted an application for adequacy determination for Puerto
Rico's municipal solid waste landfill permit program. On February 17, 1994, Puerto Rico made a revised submission.
On March 23, 1994, after reviewing Puerto Rico's application and the revised submission, EPA published a tentative
determination of adequacy for all portions of Puerto Rico's program. Further background on the tentative determination
of adequacy appears at 59 FR 13707, March 23, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. Puerto
Rico's application for program adequacy determination and its revisions were available for public review and comment
at the EPA Region II Caribbean Field Office in San Juan and at the EPA Region II Library in New York City. The public comment
period commenced on March 23, 1994 and ended on May 26, 1994. The public comment period was originally scheduled to
end on May 12, 1994. However, at a public hearing held on May 12, 1994, a request was made to extend the comment period
and EPA responded by extending the comment period until May 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region scheduled four public hearings on this tentative determination. Two public hearings were held at the Solid
Waste Management Authority in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico on May 11, 1994. Two additional hearings were held at the Mayag&uuml;ez
City Hall in Mayag&uuml;ez, Puerto Rico on May 12, 1994. A summary of the comments received, and EPA's responses thereto
is contained in the public comment section of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 4, 1993, Puerto Rico, acting through its Environmental Quality Board, adopted comprehensive, revised
regulations governing solid waste disposal. These regulations are patterned after the 40 CFR part 258 criteria,
and are intended to bring Puerto Rico into full conformity with the Federal criteria. The Puerto Rico Environmental
Quality Board has sufficient authority and responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid waste management
regulations, including a permit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. In addition, in its application, Puerto Rico states
that adequate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical, support and legal personnel will be assigned to implement its permit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary of the public comments received on the tentative determination of adequacy and EPA's responses thereto
follows below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of the commenters suggested that the Environmental Quality Board (EQB), Puerto Rico's regulating agency,
may not effectively implement and enforce the Commonwealth's new MSWLF regulations. Commenters cited evidence
of problems they believe had occurred or currently exist at particular landfill sites and which they feel EQB had not
properly addressed. The EQB, however, has instituted a new structure for implementing and enforcing its new MSWLF
permit program, which was developed in order to meet part 258 requirements. Upon reviewing EQB's MSWLF permit program,
EPA Region II believes that problems related to regulatory oversight, will be effectively addressed under the EQB's
new program. Among the changes to the program is the implementation of a new management and staffing structure. In
addition, the number of employees working on the program and the number of hours of inspection and compliance training
provided to staff have increased dramatically. These changes will allow the EQB to inspect landfills semi-annually
whereas inspections previously took place only once per year or in some cases every other year under the previous program.
Inspections by technicians at the Solid Waste Management Authority, which take place an average of 2 to 3 times per
year at each landfill, will also be performed and the results of those inspections made available to EQB. Step by-step
procedures for receiving and responding to public complaints, which did not exist under the previous program will
also help the EQB to monitor landfills and permit a more efficient public participation process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that Puerto Rico presents a different ecological situation than is found in the States, and one
where it is more difficult to find a suitable location for a landfill. This commenter felt that the Federal Government
should modify its regulations for location criteria of municipal solid waste landfills to take into account that
there are locations with different situations. EPA feels that the Federal regulations, 40 CFR part 258, already contain
sufficient flexibility, particularly in location standards to allow an approved state to consider local conditions.
The use of the flexibility, however, does require that certain environmental protection performance standards
still be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters expressed concern that the location of landfills in Puerto Rico may violate President Clinton's Executive
Order on Environmental Justice. The Federal Government, including EPA, is currently engaged in preparing a national
strategy that will establish procedures to implement this order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were additional comments related to oversight of EQB by EPA, coordination between EQB and the Solid Waste Management
Authority, siting requirements, and groundwater protection. All the foregoing comments and several additional
comments that were not relative to the subject of the public hearing are addressed in the responsiveness summary which
is made part of the public record.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the public comments, I conclude that Puerto Rico's application for adequacy determination meets
all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action takes effect on [insert date of publication here]. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All of the requirements and obligations in the Commonwealth's program are already in effect as a matter of Commonwealth
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with.
Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as Federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP) is a mechanism by which lending institutions, mortgage servicing
companies and others servicing mortgage loan portfolios can bring their mortgage loan portfolios into compliance
with the flood insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Implementation of the
various requirements of the MPPP should result in mortgagors, following receipt of notification of the need for flood
insurance, showing evidence of such a policy or purchasing the necessary coveragee through their local insurance
agent or appropriate Write Your Own (WYO) company. It is intended that flood insurance policies be written under the
MPPP only as a last resort, and only on mortgages whose mortgagors have failed to respond to the various notifications
required by the program.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Open Market Committee; Domestic Policy Directive of July 5-6, 1994</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with  271.5 of its rules regarding availability of information (12 CFR part 271), there is set forth below
the domestic policy directive issued by the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting held on July 5-6, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The directive was issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1 Copies of the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting of July 5-6, 1994, which include the domestic policy
directive issued at that meeting, are available upon request to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
Washington, D.C. 20551. The minutes are published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and in the Board's annual report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the
second quarter, causing levels of resource utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm payroll employment
have been relatively large on average in recent months; the civilian unemployment rate is reported to have declined
to 6.0 percent in May. The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May, primarily because capacity constraints
prevented normal seasonal increases in the production of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has slowed
in recent months after very large increases in February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from winter disruptions
to a pace close to the elevated fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong
uptrend in spending on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed
level in the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April than in March
but about unchanged from the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices
have remained moderate in recent months, though prices of many basic industrial materials have risen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2 percent. Most market
interest rates were up slightly on balance since the May meeting; declines in bond yields early in the intermeeting
period were offset later by market reactions to a weakening dollar in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity
prices. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was down significantly further
on balance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a sizable drop since early June.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M2 and M3 declined on average over May and June; for the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the bottom of their ranges
for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote
sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges
it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing
to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent
with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained
at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee
provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995.
The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability,
movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure
on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable
economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly
greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized

changes to dwelling units, in compliance with the regulation at 24 CFR 8.25(c). This regulation implements Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

), with regard to program accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Act prohibits discrimination against
individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The authority
to grant a time extension is jointly delegated to both the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary
for PIH. This authority is then retained and jointly redelegated to both the Director, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
Division, and to either the Director, Public Housing Division (in the case of a Public Housing Agency) or the Administrator,
Office of Native American Programs (in the case of an Indian Housing Authority), in the pertinent field offices.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulation at 24 CFR 8.25(c) requires each Public Housing Agency (PHA) and Indian Housing Authority (IHA) (collectively
referred to as HAs) to assess the need for dwelling units within its jurisdictional area which are accessible to individuals
with disabilities. Where the assessment demonstrates a need for additional accessible units, the HA must develop
a transition plan to achieve the necessary structural changes. In accordance with this regulation, each HA is to have
already made such assessment, and developed a transition plan, if required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24 CFR 8.25(c) provides that each HA must have completed the structural changes necessary to achieve accessibility
as identified in the transition plan no later than July 11, 1992. However, the regulation also provides that an HA may
obtain an extension of time in meeting this deadline under certain circumstances. Section 8.25(c) provides that
the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary for PIH may extend the deadline to as late a date as July
11, 1994 ``on a case-by-case determination that compliance within that period would impose undue financial and administrative
burdens on the operation of the recipient's public housing and multi-family Indian housing program''. This regulation
further provides that the Secretary or the Undersecretary may extend the time period for compliance from July 11,
1994, up until July 11, 1995, in ``extraordinary circumstances''. To facilitate the prompt review of each request,
the Secretary is jointly delegating to the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH, and the Assistant Secretaries
are jointly redelegating to certain officials in the field, the authority to grant an extension of time in ``extraordinary
circumstances'' for an HA to complete these structural changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary delegates, and the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH redelegate, authority as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development jointly delegates to both the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the
Assistant Secretary for PIH, who retain their authority and jointly redelegate to both the Director, Fair Housing
and Equal Opportunity Division, and to either the Director, Public Housing Division (in the case of a PHA) or the Administrator,
Office of Native American Programs (in the case of an IHA), in the pertinent field offices, the power and authority
to grant a time extension in extraordinary circumstances from July 11, 1994, for a period up to one year until July 11,
1995, for an HA to complete structural changes needed (as previously determined pursuant to 24 CFR 8.25(c)) to provide
additional units accessible to individuals with disabilities. Where a particular field office does not have a Fair
Housing and Equal Opportunity Division, the Director, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Division in the field office
which has responsibility for the programs for HAs in that jurisdiction shall have the authority with respect to the
redelegation within this notice.

ABSTRACT: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
When a company enters into a contract to develop, produce, and dispose of gas and associated products from Federal
or Indian lands, that company agrees to pay the United States or Indian Tribe or allottee a share (royalty) of the full
value of production from the leased lands. In order to determine whether the amount of royalty tendered represents
the proper royalty due, it is necessary to establish the value of allowances being deducted from royalty payments.
Allowances are taken for the cost of processing the gas stream to extract associated products, and for the cost of transporting
the gas to the processing plant and to the point of sale. The information collected is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness
of allowances taken and to ensure that proper royalty payments are made.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 29, 1994, Illinois Central Corporation (IC), Illinois Central Railroad Company (ICRR), Kansas City Southern
Industries Inc. (KCSI), and The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCSR) (collectively applicants) filed a notice
of intent indicating that IC will file an application seeking Commission approval and authorization under 49 U.S.C.
11343&hyph;47 for: (1) IC's acquisition of control of and merger with KCSI; and (2) the resulting common control of
ICRR and KCSR by IC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this transaction, IC will acquire 100% of the stock of KCSI. The acquisition will occur as part of a transaction in
which (1) KCSI will effect a reorganization in which it distributes complete ownership of its financial services
and information processing operations to the holders of KCSI's common stock; and (2) IC will place its stock in ICRR
into an independent voting trust.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Applicants state that, while awaiting approval of the transaction by the Commission, ICRR and KCSR will be operated
independently. The parties anticipate that the independent voting trust will terminate upon approval of the transaction
by this Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1&sect;On August 16, 1994, IC requested, under 49 CFR 1013.3(a), an informal opinion from the Secretary of the Commission
that the proposed voting trust arrangement will insulate IC from any violation of the Interstate Commerce Act pending
approval of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants state that, after the reorganization has occurred, IC and KCSI intend to consummate the merger in which
KCSI will be merged with IC and the separate existence of KCSI will cease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants will use the year July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, for purposes of the impact analyses to be filed in their application.
Applicants anticipate filing their application on or about November 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that this is a major transaction, as defined at 49 CFR 1180.2(a), as it is a control transaction
involving two or more class I railroads. The application must conform to the regulations set forth at 49 CFR part 1180
and must contain all information required there for major transactions, except as modified by any advance waiver.
Applicants are also required to submit maps with overlays that show the existing routes of both carriers and their
competitors.

By petition filed August 5, 1994, applicants sought approval of a protective order to protect confidential, highly
confidential, and proprietary information, including contract terms, shipper-specific traffic data, and other
traffic data to be submitted in connection with the control application. A protective order was approved in a decision
served August 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on August 5, 1994, applicants filed a petition to establish a procedural schedule. The Commission seeks comments
now on applicants' proposed procedural schedule. Applicants' proposed procedural schedule is as follows:

In addition to submitting an original and 20 copies of all documents filed with the Commission, the parties are encouraged
to submit all pleadings and attachments as computer data contained on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette which is formatted
for WordPerfect 5.1 (or formatted so that it can be converted by WordPerfect 5.1). The computer data contained on the
computer diskettes submitted are subject to the protective order attached to the Commission's decision served August
12, 1994, and this information is for the exclusive use of Commission employees working directly on review of substantive
matters in this proceeding. The flexibility provided by such computer file data will facilitate expedited review
by the Commission and its staff.

Under the proposal, immediately upon each evidentiary filing, the filing party will place all documents relevant
to the filing (other than documents that are privileged or otherwise protected from discovery) in a depository open
to all parties, and will make its witnesses available for discovery depositions. Access to documents subject to protective
order will be appropriately restricted. Parties seeking discovery depositions may proceed by agreement. Relevant
excerpts of transcripts will be received in lieu of cross-examination at the hearing, unless cross-examination
is needed to resolve material issues of disputed fact. Discovery on responsive applications will begin immediately
upon their filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed schedule contains substantially shorter time periods than those provided for in our rules at 49 CFR 1180.4(a)&hyph;(e).
For example, &sect;1180.4(e) tracks the statute at 49 U.S.C. 11345(b)(3) and requires that the evidentiary proceedings
for a major transaction be completed in 24 months after acceptance of the primary application, with a final decision
to be issued within 180 days thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We invite interested persons to submit written comments on the proposed procedural schedule. Comments must be filed

In accordance with the policy of the Department of Justice, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on July 26, 1994,
a proposed Consent Decree in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States v. IBP inc.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 94&hyph;4072, was lodged with the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois.
In this action, the United States sought injunctive relief and civil penalties against IBP inc. (``IBP'') pursuant
to Section 309 of the Clean Water Act (``the Act''), 33 U.S.C. 1319, for violations of Section 301 of the Act, and certain
terms and conditions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (``NPDES'') permit for IBP's Joslin,
Illinois facility. In addition, the State of Illinois filed a complaint in intervention, asserting claims against
IBP for violations of the Illinois Protection Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991 Ch. 1111/2 &para; 1009(a), and 35 Ill. Adm.
Code 201.141.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Decree requires IBP to construct an expansion to its current wastewater treatment system to
treat ammonia nitrogen, and the proposed Decree establishes a schedule for achieving compliance with the ammonia
nitrogen effluent limit in IBP's NPDES permit. During construction of the treatment plant expansion, IBP is required
to comply with interim ammonia nitrogen limits specified in the proposed Consent Decree. In all other respects, the
proposed Consent Decree requires IBP to treat and monitor pollutants from its Joslin facility in accordance with
the terms of its NPDES permit and applicable rules relating to wastewater from meat processing and leather tanning
facilities. The proposed Decree also requires IBP to pay a civil penalty of $250,000 to the United States and a separate
$30,000 civil penalty to the State of Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for a period of 30 days from
the date of this publication. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and
Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530. All comments should refer to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h), that a proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United District Court for
the District of Columbia in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States of America
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
AT&amp;T Corp. and McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 94&hyph;01555 (HHG). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration
of the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complaint alleges that the propose acquisition by AT&amp;T Corp. (``AT&amp;T'') of McCaw Cellular Communications,
Inc. (``McCaw'') violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, in the markets for cellular service,
cellular infrastructure equipment and interexchange service to cellular subscribers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment contains substantive obligations and restrictions that should substantially mitigate
the incentive and ability of the merged AT&amp;T-McCaw to constrain the actions of McCaw's cellular service competitors.
The proposed Final Judgment provides for separate subsidiary requirements and restrictions on the flow of certain
confidential information within the combined AT&amp;T/McCaw entity; obligates AT&amp;T to continue to deal with
its customers on terms in place prior to the merger, and on terms not less favorable than those offered to McCaw; obligates
AT&amp;T to assist, and not to interfere, with an incumbent customer's decision to change infrastructure suppliers;
and requires a buy-back provision that would reduce the lock-in effect by lowering the cost for a competitor/customer
to switch suppliers in the event that AT&amp;T fails to comply with its obligations to its customers under the judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, the proposed Final Judgment requires McCaw cellular systems to provide equal access to interexchange competitors
of AT&amp;T, which is not now provided in most McCaw systems, thereby increasing competition in the provision of interexchange
services to cellular customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed Final Judgment restrains McCaw from providing certain confidential information of other
cellular infrastructure equipment suppliers to AT&amp;T's manufacturing division to prevent anticompetitive
harm to the cellular infrastructure equipment market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and responses thereto, will
be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Richard Liebeskind, Assistant Chief, Communications and
Finance Section, Room 8104, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW Washington, DC 20001.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is stipulated by and between the undersigned parties, by their respective attorneys, that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The parties consent that a Final Judgment in the form hereto attached may be filed and entered by the Court, upon the
motion of any party or upon the Court's own motion, at any time after compliance with the requirements of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16, and without further notice to any party or other proceedings, provided
that plaintiff has not withdrawn its consent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The parties shall abide by and comply with the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment pending entry of the Final
Judgment, unless AT&amp;T or McCaw certify to the Department that this transaction has been abandoned, and withdrew
its applicable filing made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, in which case the
proposed Final Judgment or Final Judgment will be withdrawn or vacated and the action dismissed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Plaintiff may withdraw its consent to this proposed Final Judgment at any time before the entry of the proposed Final
Judgment by serving notice thereof on defendants and by filing that notice with the Court. In the event plaintiff withdraws
its consent or if the proposed Final Judgment is not entered pursuant to this Stipulation, this Stipulation will be
of no effect whatsoever, and the making of this Stipulation shall be without prejudice to any party in this or any other
proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In the event of a final and unappealable order determining that entry of this Final Judgment would be contrary to
the public interest, or otherwise constituting a decision on the merits that the proposed Final Judgment should not
be entered, and absent other agreement between these parties, the parties will continue to abide by and comply with
Section III of this Final Judgment until this action is finally adjudicated or dismissed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Stipulation by the United States to entry of this Final Judgment is not intended to, does not, and shall not be

from the Court eliminating one or more of the exception to the general definition of Local Cellular Service Areas contained
in Section II.Q of the Final Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. AT&amp;T and McCaw hereby stipulate that it will not move to modify the Final Judgment, if entered in the form attached
hereto, for eighteen months following commencement of this action, except with the consent of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Providing for each of its existing customers to designate the Interexchange Carrier of the customer's choice within
60 days after the System's conversion to equal access, and thereafter requiring each new customer to designate the
Interexchange Carrier of the customer's choice. After such date, the McCaw Cellular Systems shall block Interexchange
Services to customers who both fail to designate an Interexchange Carrier and place calls without using access codes,
except that they may allocate existing customers who fail to make such a designation among Interexchange Carriers
in proportion to the number of customers subscribing to each of these Interexchange Carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to equal access and at quarterly intervals thereafter. If customers' names, addresses, telephone number or other
information are provided to or used by AT&amp;T for the purpose of marketing Interexchange Services, the lists shall
be provided to other Interexchange Carriers at the same time and under the same terms. A McCaw Cellular System shall
not provide AT&amp;T with information about a cellular customer's Interexchange Carrier or the customer's Cellular
or Interexchange Service usage unless (a) the customer is already a customer of AT&amp;T's Interexchange Services,
and (b) the McCaw Cellular System provides other Interexchange Carriers with the same information concerning their
customers at the same time and under the same terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provide to all Interexchange Carriers Exchange Access on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality, and
price to that provided to AT&amp;T. Each McCaw Cellular System shall allow access to MTSOs through switched connections
by way of local exchange carrier access tandems, and shall provide to the Interexchange Carrier dialed digits, automatic
calling number identification and other information necessary to bill calls, answer supervision, carrier access
codes, and testing and maintenance of whatever facilities of the cellular system are used by Interexchange Carriers,
regardless of whether any of these services are provided to AT&amp;T. A McCaw Cellular System shall be required to
offer to each unaffiliated Interexchange Carrier to establish dedicated access connections to MTSOs, to perform
billing services on reasonable terms, to provide interexchange traffic routing services, provide customer location
information for use in routing calls, and to perform other activities or functions for Interexchange Carriers in
connection with the origination, routing, or termination interexchange calls in the same manner as and on the same
terms and conditions, including price, that those services, activities, or functions are provided to AT&amp;T.
If a McCaw Cellular System provides information to AT&amp;T to allow it to bill its Interexchange Service customers
for Cellular Service, it shall at each unaffiliated Interchange Carrier's option provide sufficient information
about the usage and charges for Cellular Service to other Interexchange Carriers to allow them to make commercially
reasonable arrangements to bill their customers for Cellular Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Be prohibited from discriminating in favor of AT&amp;T (a) in providing in a timely manner technical or other information
about the Cellular System or its customers, (b) in the interconnection or use of the McCaw Cellular System's service
and facilities or in the charges for each element of service, or (c) in the provision of new Exchange Access services
and the planning for and construction or modification of facilities used to provide Exchange Access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Be prohibited from implementing any new Exchange Access service, or imposing any charge on Interexchange Carriers
for Exchange Access, unless the service is available and the charge is applicable to all Interexchange Carriers and
has been announced a minimum of 60 days before the service is provided or the charge imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. A Cellular System that becomes a McCaw Cellular System following the entry of this Final Judgment shall comply with
the provisions of this Section IV within one year of the date on which it becomes a McCaw Cellular System, or within 21
months of the commencement of this action, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section IV, and following the dates upon which AT&amp;T, McCaw and McCaw
Minority Owned Cellular Systems may use the name ``AT&amp;T,'' its trademarks and trade names pursuant to Section
III of this Final Judgment, AT&amp;T may act as McCaw's agent in marketing Local Cellular Services and may jointly
market Local Cellular Services, Interexchange Services and other services, provided that

Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA'' or ``Tunney Act''), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h),
plaintiff, the United States, submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment
for entry with the consent of defendants, AT&amp;T Corp. (``AT&amp;T'') and McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc.
(``McCaw'') in this civil antitrust proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 15, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint, under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 25, against AT&amp;T and McCaw, alleging that the proposed merger of defendants violates Section 7 of the
Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Decreasing actual and potential competition in the market for cellular services because the merger would combine
McCaw, a cellular service provider with AT&amp;T, the leading supplier of cellular infrastructure equipment. That
vertical integration may substantially increase the merged firm's ability and incentive to raise the costs, limit
the capacity, or constrain the quality of service of McCaw's cellular service competitors that are dependent upon
AT&amp;T for cellular infrastructure equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Decreasing competition in the market for cellular infrastructure equipment by providing AT&amp;T with access
to competitively sensitive and proprietary information of McCaw's principal equipment supplier, L.M. Ericsson
(``Ericsson'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Decreasing actual and potential competition in the market for interexchange services to cellular subscribers,
because the merger of AT&amp;T and McCaw would combine AT&amp;T, the largest interexchange carrier in the United
States with McCaw, one of only two cellular service providers in many markets; and would combine the two largest providers
of interexchange service to cellular service customers in many areas served by McCaw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AT&amp;T is the dominant supplier of interexchange telecommunications service in the United States, providing
interexchange service to wireline and cellular telephone customers. AT&amp;T is also the largest supplier of the
cellular infrastructure equipment (switches, cell site radios and related equipment) used by cellular carriers
to provide that service in the United States and North America. AT&amp;T, along with the next two largest suppliers_Motorola
and Ericsson_account for the vast majority of the installed base of cellular infrastructure equipment in the United
States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
McCaw is the largest provider of cellular service in the United States, with ownership interests in cellular systems
serving approximately 22 percent of all of the cellular subscribers in the United States. These systems include the
following cities: New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle,
Portland, St. Louis and Kansas City. McCaw owns and operates a number of these systems in partnership with companies
with whom it competes in other service areas. These companies include AirTouch Communications, Inc. (previously
PacTel Mobile Services) and BellSouth Corporation. McCaw operates many of its cellular systems under the name ``Cellular
One,'' a tradename owned by a joint venture among a number of cellular licensees including McCaw and Southwestern
Bell Corp. McCaw also provides interexchange services to customers of its cellular services, primarily over AT&amp;T
facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to an agreement dated August 16, 1993, AT&amp;T agreed to purchase McCaw. On July 15, 1994, the United States
and defendants filed a stipulation by which they consented to entry of a proposed Final Judgment, after compliance
with the APPA, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h), designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger
in each of the affected markets. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court
will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final
Judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained more fully below, the proposed Final Judgment would substantially mitigate the incentive and ability
of the merged AT&amp;T-McCaw to constrain the actions of McCaw's cellular service competitors, by providing mechanisms
to insure that AT&amp;T could not use its position as the incumbent supplier to those McCaw competitors that are locked
in to AT&amp;T's equipment to disadvantage or discriminate against them in favor of McCaw. These mechanisms include:
separate subsidiary requirements and restrictions on the flow of certain confidential information within the combined
AT&amp;T/McCaw entity; obligations on AT&amp;T to continue to deal with its customers on terms in place prior to the
merger, and on terms not less favorable than those offered to McCaw; obligations to assist and not interfere with an
incumbent customer's changing infrastructure suppliers; and a buy-back obligation that would reduce the lock-in
effect by lowering the cost for a competitor/customer to switch suppliers in the event that AT&amp;T fails to comply

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address concerns in the interexchange markets, the proposed Final Judgment would require McCaw cellular systems
to provide equal access to interexchange competitors of AT&amp;T, which is not now provided in most McCaw systems,
thereby increasing competition in the provision of interexchange services to cellular customers.

1. Cellular Services Markets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cellular carriers operate on either of two bands of radio frequencies, referred to as the ``A-side'' and the ``B-side.''
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The FCC awarded one A-side and one B-side license separately in 306 metropolitan areas, referred to as MSAs, and 428
rural areas called RSAs. Initially, the FCC awarded the B-side license to the local telephone company or an affiliate
thereof and the A-side license to firms other than the local telephone company.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Cellular licenses are transferable, and since the initial awards there has been considerable consolidation of ownership.
Telephone companies have acquired many A-side licenses outside of the areas in which they provide local exchange
service. Cellular service is fully interconnected with landline telephone networks, and subscribers can both originate
calls to and receive calls from landline subscribers, including long distance calls.

Cellular licenses held by AT&amp;T or the Bell Companies, at the time of AT&amp;T's divestiture of those Bell Companies
in 1984, were retained by the Bell Companies and are now generally held by affiliates of their respective parent Regional
Holding Companies.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cellular service is a relevant product market and a ``line of commerce'' within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton
Act. Unlike conventional landline telephone service, cellular service provides customers with the added feature
of mobility, and landline telephone service therefore is not a substitute. The relevant geographic markets are those
service areas in which the FCC has licensed cellular carriers to provide cellular service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With extremely limited exceptions, there are no providers of mobile telephone services other than the two cellular
carriers. At the current time, the holders of these cellular licenses, including McCaw, exercise market power in
the provision of cellular service. These duopolies are characterized by rapidly growing demand and minimal price
competition, resulting in high margins to cellular carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Cellular Infrastructure Equipment Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A cellular system consists primarily of one or more mobile telephone switching offices (``MTSOs'' or ``switches'')
connected to numerous cell sites. A cell site is a radio facility that receives and transmits cellular calls. Cellular
carriers provide cellular service by dividing their licensed service areas into ``cells''_each with a corresponding
cell site_and reusing the radio channels in different cells. The principal components of a cell site are radio units,
radio frames and software (referred to collectively as ``radio base stations'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A switch is a large central computer facility connected to cell sites, other MTSOs and local and long distance telephone
networks. The MTSO controls the ``handoff'' of calls between the cells and transfers calls between the cellular systems
and the wireline networks of local exchange carriers and interexchange carriers. A cellular system in a large metropolitan
area like New York City or Baltimore/Washington might typically include two to four switches and more than one hundred
radio base stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One principal method of expanding the capacity of a cellular system is to increase the number of cells. The creation
of these new cells requires the purchase and deployment of an additional radio base station for each new cell. At some
point in expanding the capacity of a system it also becomes necessary to add additional switches. Another method of
capacity expansion currently being used is to convert the radio transmissions from analog to digital. This conversion
requires the deployment of new radios and cell site equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In North America, cellular switches made by one manufacturer are not compatible with radio base stations made by another.
Accordingly, a cellular carrier seeking to expand the capacity of a particular system must obtain additional switches
and radio base stations from its incumbent cellular infrastructure equipment supplier. Digital conversion requires
the deployment of switch and cell site equipment and software that is noncompatible between manufacturers. Enhancements
that add customer features or improve a system's capacity or efficiency are added to systems primarily through switch
or cell site software upgrades. Because the interfaces between the cellular infrastructure equipment and software
are proprietary, the equipment vendor is, today, the only one who can provide these enhancements. In addition, cellular
carriers are largely dependent on their equipment vendors for ongoing engineering support and maintenance, as well
as efficiency and service enhancing features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, once a cellular carrier has made the decision to deploy a particular vendor's cellular infrastructure equipment
in a particular system, that carrier becomes locked in to that vendor's equipment and must either continue to purchase
equipment and software from that same vendor or incur the substantial costs of replacing the deployed switches and
radio base stations of the incumbent vendor. As cellular systems grow, so also does the cost of switching vendors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment providers typically have access to proprietary and competitively sensitive information of their cellular
carrier customers. Some of this information is acquired in the performance of installation, maintenance and other
services provided by the manufacturers to the cellular carriers. For example, through its access to a cellular carrier's
switch, a manufacturer has access to day-to-day operating information about the switch, including usage patterns.
Manufacturers must also receive advance notice of planned system expansions so that they may allocate equipment
and other resources to that customer. Manufacturers also work closely with their customers in the development of
new services and features, sometimes on a proprietary basis, This development work necessarily provides the manufacturer
with insights into, and advance notice of, its cellular carrier customer's marketing and sales plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cellular infrastructure equipment is a relevant product market. Cellular infrastructure equipment manufactured
for use in North America is based on a different standard than equipment manufactured for use by European cellular
providers. Accordingly, equipment used in North America is not compatible with equipment manufactured for use in
Europe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many of the cities in which McCaw has an interest in the A-side cellular system, the B-side competitor has deployed
and is operating its system using AT&amp;T cellular infrastructure equipment. Major markets in which McCaw competes
with AT&amp;T customers include, among others, New York, Dallas, San Francisco, Miami, St. Louis, Tampa, Orlando,
Salt Lake City, Kansas City and Pittsburgh. McCaw uses Ericsson equipment in the majority of its systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AT&amp;T currently has the ability to raise the costs, inhibit the ability to increase system capacity and capabilities
and degrade the quality of service of its locked in B-side equipment customers. AT&amp;T could achieve this by increasing
the prices of its equipment and software or by withholding or delaying the development or delivery of necessary equipment,
software, services or other upgrades.

3. Harm to Competition Arising from the Combination of McCaw's Cellular Services and AT&amp;T's Cellular Infrastructure
Equipment Business
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed merger may substantially lessen competition in cellular services markets. Although AT&amp;T already
has the ability to disadvantage its cellular infrastructure customers, today AT&amp;T has no strong incentive to
disadvantage one cellular carrier customer vis-a-vis another, because AT&amp;T is not providing local cellular
service. As a result of this merger, however, AT&amp;T would gain the incentive to harm McCaw's competitors that use
AT&amp;T cellular equipment, to McCaw's advantage, by exploiting AT&amp;T's control over the costs, capabilities
and capacity to those locked-in equipment customers. Thus, the combined AT&amp;T-McCaw would have the incentive
and the ability to either raise its cellular service rivals' costs or, through the threat of doing so, reduce its rivals'
incentive to compete. In either event the likely outcome is increased prices and lower quality service to consumers
of cellular service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The merger also will give McCaw access to competitively sensitive and proprietary information of McCaw's competitors
that AT&amp;T acquires through its role as cellular infrastructure equipment supplier to Macaw's competitors.
As described above, this information relates to planned expansions, new service offerings and other efficiency
enhancing upgrades. McCaw's competitors could well decide to forgo or limit their expenditures of resources in these
areas if they believe that they will not enjoy the competitive benefit of such expenditures because McCaw will have
immediate access to their competitive plans. As a result, consumers of cellular service are likely to pay higher prices
and receive lower quality service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed merger may also harm competition in the sale of cellular infrastructure equipment used by North American
cellular service providers, by giving AT&amp;T access to competitively sensitive or proprietary information of
Ericsson that McCaw acquires through its position as a customer for and user of Ericsson cellular infrastructure
equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Harm to Competition Arising from the Combination of McCaw's Cellular Services Business and AT&amp;T's Interexchange
Business
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interexchange services are telecommunications services that connect calls between different local exchange areas
or local cellular service areas. AT&amp;T is the dominant interexchange carrier for both wired and cellular telephone
service, with MCI and Sprint and a number of smaller firms having much smaller shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of interexchange services to cellular subscribers is a relevant product market. Customers use cellular
phones to meet their needs away from landline telephones; access to interexchange service over landline telephones
is inconsistent with the needs motivating cellular phone usage and thus is not a good substitute. Cellular subscribers
can only access interexchange service providers that have exchange access to that cellular system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the lack of effective competition in the cellular service markets, McCaw has been able to deny its cellular customers
the ability to select their interexchange service provider. In those markets in which McCaw's systems are not controlled
by a Bell Company that is subject to equal access requirements,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 McCaw provides interexchange service to its cellular customers on an exclusive basis (typically reselling AT&amp;T
service), and does not generally allow its customers to access other interexchange carriers directly. In systems
operated by Bell Companies subject to equal access requirements, interexchange service is provided by the interexchange
carrier of the customer's choice. Thus, customers may choose between McCaw's A-side bundle of local and interexchange
services or the B-side carrier's local cellular service and, where the B-side carrier is a Bell Company subject to
equal access, the interexchange service offered by the customer's interexchange carrier of choice. (Where the B-side
carrier is not a Bell Company, the customer's choice is between two bundles of local cellular and long distance service.)

The relevant geographic markets are cellular service areas in which McCaw offers bundled cellular and interexchange
services. These areas include New York, Miami, Tampa, Minneapolis, Seattle, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Portland
and Sacramento. Each of these markets is highly concentrated. Among Bell Company cellular systems providing equal
access, AT&amp;T is the dominant interexchange carrier, with more than 70 percent of subscribers, with MCI and Sprint
sharing nearly all of the remainder.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 McCaw is generally the exclusive provider of interexchange service to customers of its A-side systems that do not
provide equal access.

The merger may lessen competition substantially in the markets for the provision of interexchange service to cellular
subscribers. The merger would foreclose competition between the two largest providers of interexchange service
in the highly concentrated markets in which McCaw currently provides interexchange service to its cellular customers
without an equal access obligation. The merger also combines AT&amp;T, the leading provider of interexchange service,
with McCaw, which has market power over the provision of interexchange service by virtue of the fact that it controls
access by its cellular customers to interexchange services. As a result, competition in the provision of interexchange
service to cellular customers in these areas may be substantially lessened and cellular subscribers may pay higher
prices for interexchange service.

Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Final Judgment addresses the competitive concerns raised by the proposed merger and AT&amp;T and McCaw
in two principal ways. First, to guard against harm to competition in interexchange telecommunications, it requires
AT&amp;T to provide all interexchange carriers with equal access to McCaw cellular systems. Second, the proposed
Final Judgment contains a group of provisions intended to ameliorate the lock-in faced by AT&amp;T cellular infrastructure
equipment customers, which should make it substantially less likely that AT&amp;T can raise the costs of its rivals
in wireless service (or threaten to do so), and therefore guard against anticompetitive effects in wireless service
markets. Finally, the proposed Final Judgment contains restrictions intended to protect against anticompetitive
effects in the cellular infrastructure equipment market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described above, McCaw currently does not provide equal access to interexchange carriers from its cellular systems.
Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment will change these arrangements by requiring McCaw to offer all interexchange
carriers equal access to all of its cellular systems, permitting its customers to choose among interexchange carriers.
The need for these provisions is predicated on the noncompetitive structure of current cellular service markets
and the market power currently possessed by McCaw and other providers of cellular exchange service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section IV.B provides for the phased-in conversion of McCaw Cellular Systems to equal access over a 21-month period
after the commencement of this action, pursuant to a plan to be approved by the United States according to Section VII.A
of the judgment. ``McCaw Cellular Systems'' are defined in Section II.T to include systems in which McCaw holds voting
interests greater than 50 percent or in which it has the right, power or ability to control. ``Control'' is defined
in Section II.K as the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a corporation or partnership,
whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. McCaw would not, under this definition,
be considered to control a corporation or partnership in which another entity held a significantly larger ownership
interest unless McCaw had expressly been given the right to control, such as through voting rights or by contract.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV.A provides that, prior to its conversion to equal access, no McCaw Cellular System may alter its arrangements
for the provision of interexchange service in ways that discriminate in favor of AT&amp;T in the provision of exchange
access. Pursuant to Section III.E, a McCaw Cellular System or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System may use the name
``AT&amp;T'' or any trademark or trade name of AT&amp;T in its corporate or service names only after it has completed
conversion to equal access and balloted existing customers pursuant to Sections IV.B and IV.C. In addition, neither
AT&amp;T, McCaw nor McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems may use the name AT&amp;T or any trademark or trade name
of AT&amp;T in marketing or advertising cellular service until 60% of the McCaw Cellular Systems, measured by subscribers
(and not including Bell Company cellular systems that provide equal access pursuant to the MFJ) have completed conversion
to equal access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections IV.B, IV.C and IV.D of the judgment prescribe the basic requirements of equal access. Section IV.B.1 requires
each McCaw Cellular System to provide local cellular service under prices and terms that do not depend upon the customer
obtaining interexchange service from AT&amp;T or a McCaw affiliate, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on an unbundled basis. Moreover, McCaw, McCaw Cellular Systems and their employees and agents (including AT&amp;T
when it acts as agent for a McCaw Cellular System pursuant to Section IV.F of the judgment) may not recommend, sell or
otherwise market the interexchange service of any interexchange carriers, and are required to administer interexchange
carrier selection procedures on a carrier-neutral and nondiscriminatory basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.B also requires McCaw to ballot its existing customers to permit them to choose an interexchange carrier
to which all of the customer's originating interexchange communications will be routed automatically, without
the use of any access codes (i.e., on a 1+basis), as well as to permit the customer to access other interexchange carriers
by dialing the appropriate carrier identification code (i.e., on a 10&hyph;XXX basis). Balloting will occur within
60 days of each McCaw Cellular System's conversion to equal access. If, in the balloting process, any McCaw customer
fails to choose an interexchange carrier, those customers may be allocated to interexchange carriers in proportion
to the number of customers subscribing to each carrier.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Thereafter, interexchange services will be blocked to any new customer that fails to choose a carrier and attempts
to place calls without access codes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific balloting process will be described in the equal access plans filed by defendants under Section VII.A
of the proposed Final Judgment. It is anticipated that there might be more than one opportunity for each customer to
select an interexchange carrier prior to any allocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To permit all interexchange carriers to have a meaningful opportunity to market their services to customers of McCaw
Cellular Systems, those systems will be required to provide interexchange carriers with the names and addresses
of their existing customers at least 60 days prior to conversion to equal access, and at quarterly intervals thereafter.
Similarly, under Section IV.C, any customer information provided to AT&amp;T by a McCaw Cellular System must be provided
to other interexchange carriers at the same time and under the same terms. A McCaw Cellular System may not provide AT&amp;T
with information about a customer's interexchange carrier or cellular or interexchange usage unless the customer
is already a customer of AT&amp;T's interexchange service and unless it provides the same information at the same
time to other interexchange carriers concerning their own customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The post-conversion equal access requirements contained in Section IV.D largely parallel the analogous requirements
of the MFJ including requirements that each McCaw Cellular System provide interexchange carriers exchange access
on an unbundled basis equal in type, quality and price to that provided to AT&amp;T.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That section also provides that if a McCaw Cellular System provides information to AT&amp;T to allow AT&amp;T to bill
its interexchange customers for cellular service (subject to the restrictions of Section IV.F), it must at the option
of any other interexchange carrier provide that carrier with sufficient information about the usage and charges
for cellular service to allow it to make commercially reasonable arrangements to bill its interexchange customers
for cellular service. The last sentence of Section IV.D.1 does not impose any additional obligation on AT&amp;T or
McCaw to bill for other interexchange carriers, but does require them to provide competing carriers with sufficient
information so that they can make commercially reasonable arrangements to perform billing themselves or have billing
done by third parties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis for this requirement is the concern that AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw could put it in the position of being
the only interexchange carrier with the ability to offer prospective customers of wireless interexchange service
the option of receiving a single bill for both cellular and interexchange services. Given AT&amp;T's already dominant
position in this segment of the interexchange market, this added advantage could be sufficient to further increase
AT&amp;T's ability to increase prices or exclude interexchange competitors by virtue of its control of a cellular
duopolist. The language used in Section IV.D.1 was adopted in preference to a simple nondiscrimination requirement
out of a concern that, given its position as a possibly major provider of billing services to McCaw, arrangements that
could be workable for AT&amp;T could be totally uneconomic for other interexchange carriers. Thus, it might not be
practical for smaller interexchange carriers to perform all of the rating and processing of local cellular calls
if they only provide interexchange service to a relatively small number of McCaw customers. The chosen language was
intended to assure that sufficiently refined billing information was provided to such interexchange carriers that
they could readily incorporate it with their interexchange bills with a minimum of additional processing and programming
required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.F. permits AT&amp;T to act as McCaw's agent in marketing local cellular services and in jointly marketing
local cellular, interexchange and other services on specified conditions. These conditions, which basically track
those the United States has recommended for the Bell Companies if they should be permitted to provide wireless interexchange
service, are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
first,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 if AT&amp;T engages in marketing local cellular service for McCaw, it must advise actual or prospective subscribers
of their right to resubscribe to the interexchange carrier of their choice; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
second,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T must state the price, terms and rate plans for local cellular and interexchange service separately, meaning
that it cannot sell bundled offerings of local cellular and interexchange service; and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
third,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T is enjoined from selling interexchange service at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the customer
obtains local cellular service from McCaw, and McCaw and McCaw Cellular Systems are enjoined from selling local cellular
service at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the customer obtains interexchange service from AT&amp;T.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, AT&amp;T may, without separately stating the charges for interexchange
service and terminating local cellular service, offer a ``calling party pays'' service for calls made to a cellular
telephone. Ordinarily, the cellular subscriber receiving the calls pays for the cellular airtime. Section IV.E.2
would permit AT&amp;T to charge a single price for the interexchange portion of such a call and the terminating airtime
(paid by the caller, not the called party), under the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AT&amp;T must obtain the underlying local cellular service used to terminate the call at a generally available rate
which, to prevent against artificially high transfer prices,is no higher than the rate offered to resellers of local
cellular service; and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
second,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 this rate must be disclosed to other interexchange carriers and be described in the Equal Access plan to be filed for
approval by the United States. These conditions will allow a potentially useful new service to be provided while assuring
that AT&amp;T's competitors will have a fair opportunity to compete with AT&amp;T in providing this service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.G provides that if the United States certifies, upon a showing by AT&amp;T, that there is insufficient
demand by interexchange carriers for access to McCaw Cellular systems within any Local Cellular Service Area, McCaw
Cellular Systems may provide new services in which access is provided to interexchange carriers at centralized points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV.H permits McCaw to hand off cellular digital packet data transmissions (as specified in Section II.F)
to interexchange carriers at centralized points. The United States understands that the transport cost for packetized
data, especially that using the Internet Protocol, is small in comparison to other elements of the service, and, thus,
this service could be economically justified more easily (in more locations) if providers did not need to implement
switching or routing points in each local Cellular Service Area. In addition, since transport across the Internet
does not involve distance-sensitive charges, it will not make any difference to users where their messages are transfered
onto the Internet. Finally, the Internet protocol does not have any position for indicating a customer's choice of
access provider and thus it would make use of the CDPD service less convenient and probably more expensive for such
users if they were required to include addressing for separate access providers in addition to the customary Internet
address normally employed by such users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cellular systems in which McCaw has voting interest of fifty percent or less and does not have the right, power or ability
to control are defined in Section II.U as ``McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems.'' These systems are not subject
to most of the equal access requirements of Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, but are subject to the non-bundling
requirements of Section IV.F.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Section IV.E provides that if AT&amp;T or McCaw obtains control of a cellular system after entry of the proposed Final
Judgment, it will be converted to equal access within one year (or within 21 months after the commencement of this action,
whichever is later).

Some of the cellular systems in which McCaw has an interest are deemed ``Bell Companies'' under the MFJ and are subject
to the MFJ's equal access requirements. The United States has proposed an order to the MFJ Court that would impose certain
requirements in order to protect the provision of equal access by those systems. Whether these systems are also McCaw
Cellular Systems, or are McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems, depends on whether McCaw (as well as the Bell Company)
controls the system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The equal access obligations imposed by the proposed Final Judgment apply to interexchange services, i.e., services
that extend beyond the boundaries of a Local Cellular Service Area. Section II.Q of the judgment defines those areas
as the areas in which the Bell Companies are permitted under the MFJ, including any orders entered under it or any legislation
that supersedes or modifies it, to provide cellular exchange service without an equal access obligation. The majority
of McCaw Cellular Systems are configured to provide cellular exchange services in areas that would be permissible
for the Bell Companies under the MFJ and waiver orders entered under it. There are, however, 19 McCaw Cellular Systems
whose local service areas extend beyond the bounds that would be permitted for a Bell Company. Section II.Q allows
``grandfathered'' exceptions to the general definition of Local Cellular Service Areas for those systems. As the
stipulation expressly notes, by permitting these exceptions, the United States has not concluded that these areas
are appropriate local calling areas for cellular service, but agreed to these exceptions for the present time, subject
to further order of the Court, for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, McCaw has a single switch (or several interconnected switches) located in one LATA but connected to
some cell sites located outside the LATA. In many of these cases, either no Bell Company is licensed to serve the area
in competition with McCaw, or a Bell Company is licensed to serve only part of the area and thus could not feasibly offer
service throughout the same area even apart from MFJ constraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC currently has under way a proceeding considering whether to impose equal access requirements on all cellular
or commercial mobile radio service providers, in which the appropriate scope of local calling areas is an issue. In
light of these developments, the United States determined not to require McCaw to reconfigure its existing systems
until other proceedings addressing the appropriate scope of local cellular calling areas are concluded. If those
proceedings result in determinations that are inconsistent with the exceptions in Section II.Q, or if it otherwise
appears that any exceptions are not justified, the United States has reserved the right to seek orders from the Court
eliminating any such exceptions. In such a proceeding, AT&amp;T might contend that such exceptions are consistent
with prior practice under the MFJ or are otherwise appropriate.

<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 customers who rely on AT&amp;T equipment and are locked in to AT&amp;T. Section V of the proposed Final Judgment contains
several provisions designed to restrict AT&amp;T's ability and incentive to use its position as equipment supplier
to McCaw's wireless competitors to disadvantage those customers/competitors vis-a-vis McCaw.

Because AT&amp;T is not only a leading supplier of cellular infrastructure equipment, but is also developing and
selling infrastructure equipment for other wireless services that are being developed and that may compete with
cellular service in the future, many of the provisions of Section V apply to ``wireless services'' and the infrastructure
equipment used to provide those services. ``Wireless Service'' is defined in Section II.AF to include not just cellular
service, but those telecommunications services that use radio transmission between the customer and the network,
including cellular, land mobile radio, commercial mobile radio, specialized mobile radio, personal communications
services, and any other mobile radio services that have been or might be authorized by the FCC or offered using radio
transmission between the customer and the network.

The duties of Section V apply only so long as McCaw is affiliated with an AT&amp;T business unit that manufactures cellular
or other wireless infrastructure equipment, as will occur once the merger is consummated. If AT&amp;T, at a point
prior to expiration of the decree, were to divest control of either McCaw or its wireless infrastructure equipment
manufacturing business, the provisions of Section V would no longer be in effect, except for any buy-back liability
under Section V.E accruing as a result of decree violations during the period of affiliation.

1. Misuse of Nonpublic Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V.A seeks to prevent the potential for harm to competition that might arise as a result of (1) AT&amp;T gaining
access to nonpublic information of a competitor that is a supplier to McCaw or (2) McCaw gaining access to nonpublic
information of a competitor that is a customer of AT&amp;T. The details of procedures adopted by AT&amp;T and McCaw
to implement the provisions of Section V.A will be set forth in Nonpublic Information and Structural Separation implementation
plans to be filed for approval by the United States pursuant to Section VII.A. of the judgment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As one safeguard against improper disclosure of confidential information, Section V.A.4.a requires AT&amp;T to
establish separate Marketing Account Teams to serve (1) McCaw and other AT&amp;T affiliates and (2) unaffiliated
wireless infrastructure equipment customers. These Marketing Account Teams, as specified in Section II.R, will
be responsible for selling and related services in connection with selling telecommunications equipment, including
customer relationship management, sales, pricing, presentation of bids, basic technical and engineering advice,
order processing and management, and project management. The United States understands that most of the interaction
the AT&amp;T Network Wireless Infrastructure Equipment Unit will have with customers will be by the Marketing Account
Teams. The responsibilities of Marketing Account Teams will be specified in the Structural Separation implementation
plan. In order to assure effective separation, that plan will provide procedures to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic
information in the event that members of Marketing Account Teams serving Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure
Equipment Customers (defined in Section II.AC as customers that are neither affiliates of AT&amp;T or McCaw nor McCaw
Minority Owned Cellular Systems) are assigned to any AT&amp;T or McCaw business that either provides telecommunications
equipment to AT&amp;T, McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, or that provides or plans for any AT&amp;T
or McCaw wireless service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V.A.4.b takes steps to assure that nonpublic information of Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure equipment
customers is not misused by AT&amp;T as a result of any proprietary development work it performs for equipment customers.
Section II.Y defines Proprietary Development as the development of products, features or functions for cellular
infrastructure equipment that is not intended to be made available to more than one customer or its affiliates. Section
V.A.4.b contemplates the formation of Development Teams to conduct Proprietary Development, and requires AT&amp;T
develop procedures to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic information in the event that members of Development Teams
that do such Proprietary Development for unaffiliated customers perform Proprietary Development for McCaw or for
any AT&amp;T telecommunications service. The principal goal of this provision is to assure that AT&amp;T Development
Teams that obtain nonpublic information about the business, plans or technology of an unaffiliated equipment customer
in the course of performing Proprietary Development work for that customer do not use that information to the benefit
of the telecommunications businesses of AT&amp;T or McCaw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of Section V.A are intended to prevent the inappropriate disclosure and use of Nonpublic Information
obtained by AT&amp;T or McCaw from unaffiliated equipment customers or suppliers. Section II.X contains a definition
of Nonpublic Information. That definition identifies or includes various categories of information which, if inappropriately
disclosed or used, could cause competitive harm. The most sensitive categories of such information are specified
in Section II.X.2(a). Information enumerated in that subsection may not be disclosed even with the consent of the
supplier of the information.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 An unaffiliated customer or supplier may designate in writing as proprietary other documentary information (or,
in the case of oral, visual or other information, contemporaneously with the disclosure), and such information will
be treated as Nonpublic Information. Information that was provided to AT&amp;T or McCaw prior to entry of the proposed
Final Judgment may be designated as such by the supplier of the information within 180 days after entry of the judgment,
in which case it will be subject to the same protections as other Nonpublic Information. The definition of Nonpublic
Information in Section II.X excludes various categories of information obtained by AT&amp;T by means other than
a breach of duty to its customers, as well as information that is over six years old. In addition, an unaffiliated customer
or supplier may waive any or all of the protections against the disclosure of Nonpublic Information, except for the
categories specified in Section II.X.2(a). This exception is intended to guard against the use of such information
for coordination among competitors.

Section V.A.1.a provides that AT&amp;T shall not allow Nonpublic Information of its Unaffiliated Wireless Infrastructure
Equipment Customers to be disclosed for any reason to (i) McCaw or any of its directors, officers or employees; (ii)
any McCaw Minority Owned Wireless System (except for information relating specifically to such a system); (iii)

Likewise, AT&amp;T is barred by Section V.A.1.b from disclosing any Nonpublic Information relating to the provision
of any wireless service by McCaw or AT&amp;T that it obtains by reason of being an equipment supplier to McCaw to any
unaffiliated equipment customer. Under Section V.A.1.c, if certain senior officers of AT&amp;T obtain any such
Nonpublic Information, they may not disclose it to other persons identified in Section V.A.1.a.

McCaw is similarly enjoined by Section V.A.2 from allowing Nonpublic Information it obtains from its unaffiliated

or marketing of AT&amp;T's telecommunications equipment. Likewise, McCaw is enjoined from allowing Nonpublic
Information of any unaffiliated interexchange carrier to be disclosed to persons involved in the design, development,
fabrication or marketing of any AT&amp;T telecommunications product or service, and access to such Nonpublic Information
shall be limited to authorized persons within McCaw and within AT&amp;T's Network Wireless Infrastructure Unit
having a need to know such information.

2. Ongoing Support for Locked-In Customers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V.B of the proposed final judgment contains provisions designed to prevent AT&amp;T from raising the costs
of McCaw's competitors in connection with the provision of such products and services. Since locked-in equipment
customers are dependent on AT&amp;T for a variety of critical ongoing support functions and products, Section V.B.1
requires AT&amp;T to provide its unaffiliated cellular infrastructure equipment customers with the following
products and services, in accordance with the same pricing and business practices that prevailed prior to August
1, 1993: (a) Technical support and maintenance; (b) installation, engineering, repair and maintenance services;
(c) additional switching and cell site equipment to be deployed in that system; (d) upgrades and other AT&amp;T cellular
infrastructure equipment developed for use with these systems; and (e) spare, repair or replacement parts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is intended to assure that AT&amp;T will deal with its unaffiliated equipment customers in the same
manner as it did prior to announcement of the proposed merger with McCaw,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 and that such customers will continue to obtain the products and services they need to provide cellular service, including
software upgrades and switching and cell site equipment needed to expand the capacity of their systems. AT&amp;T
also may not discriminate in favor of McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems in the way in
which such products or services are made available to cellular systems, and the terms on which such products or services
are provided shall not vary depending on whether the system to which they will be provided competes with McCaw or a McCaw
Minority Owned Cellular System.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, if AT&amp;T discontinues the offering of any cellular infrastructure equipment service, part or product,
it shall either arrange an alternative source of supply for the product or, if unsuccessful, provide any affected
cellular carrier with the licenses to use (and rights to sublicense) whatever technical information is necessary
to provide such services, parts or products (to the extent AT&amp;T is able to do so), so that the carrier can obtain
the service, part or product from another source. Such licenses shall be granted on reasonable and nondiscriminatory
terms.

3. Development of New Features and Functions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section V.C contains provisions designed to prevent AT&amp;T from disadvantaging its locked-in customers that
compete with McCaw with respect to development of new features and functions, including Proprietary Development
(defined in Section II.Y). Under Section V.C.1, whenever AT&amp;T engages in development of new features or functions
for use with AT&amp;T equipped cellular systems that, if successful, will be made available to two or more cellular
carriers that are not affiliated with each other (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, developments that are not intended for a single customer), AT&amp;T shall disclose such enhancements to unaffiliated
carriers at the same time it discloses them to McCaw or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems, and shall make them available
to unaffiliated customers at the same time it makes them available to McCaw or any McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System.
This section is triggered only by development of features pertaining to systems installed or contracted for prior
to the date of entry of the judgment, as it is specifically intended to address a concern relating to existing locked-in
customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remainder of Section V.C addresses AT&amp;T's obligations in the event it performs development work specifically
for McCaw, a McCaw Cellular System or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System. AT&amp;T has advised the United States
that, at present, AT&amp;T occasionally develops features or functions that are applicable only to a particular
cellular carrier or system because of its adjunct hardware or software or its specific operations or network. If AT&amp;T
engages in such development for McCaw, a McCaw Cellular System or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, AT&amp;T
must afford unaffiliated customers substantially the same opportunity to contract for such development work on
substantially the same compensatory basis. If AT&amp;T performs other Proprietary Development for McCaw, a McCaw
Cellular System or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, it will be required upon reasonable request to perform
Proprietary Development for unaffiliated customers under reasonable terms and conditions that are not less favorable
to the unaffiliated customer than those provided to McCaw, McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular
Systems. Under Section V.C.3, if AT&amp;T performs Proprietary Development for McCaw (or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular
Systems) it must honor any reasonable request by an unaffiliated carrier to perform such development for it, but AT&amp;T
is entitled to reasonable compensation and other terms so long as those terms are not less favorable than the terms
offered to McCaw or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems.

4. Redeployment of AT&amp;T Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to further reduce AT&amp;T's ability to exploit its locked-in equipment customers that compete with McCaw,
Section V.D contains provisions that should make it easier for customers that desire to replace AT&amp;T equipment
to do so. In the event that a customer has deployed or contracted to deploy an AT&amp;T equipped cellular system prior
to the entry of the judgment, and the customer wishes to redeploy the AT&amp;T equipment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to facilitate its replacement) or to replace or supplement it with another manufacturer's equipment in whole or
in part, AT&amp;T is required to provide reasonably necessary technical assistance and cooperation to allow the
customer to accomplish such replacement or redeployment and to permit interoperation of the AT&amp;T equipment
with the new manufacturer's equipment in that area or an adjacent area (as in an overlay or core swap-out). AT&amp;T
is permitted to receive reasonable compensation for providing such assistance, and is not required to provide its
equipment competitors with proprietary information that is not necessary to allow the interoperation of their equipment
with AT&amp;T's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to give AT&amp;T cellular infrastructure equipment customers greater freedom to redeploy AT&amp;T
equipment to a new location or sell it, and to make it easier for customers wishing to do so to change equipment suppliers,
Section V.D.2 requires AT&amp;T to waive contractual requirements that it receive prior notice of or consent to redeployment.
It also provides that, in the event of redeployment or sale, the original warranty, license and other contractual
rights will survive and pass to the transferee, as will AT&amp;T's obligations under Sections V.A, V.B, V.C and V.D
of the judgment. AT&amp;T's buy-back obligations under Section V.E will not, however, pass to a new purchaser of the
equipment, inasmuch as that remedy is especially designed to guard against raising the costs of the locked-in equipment
customers that compete with McCaw.

5. Buy-Back
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The detailed requirements of Sections V.A through V.D of the proposed Final Judgment are intended to mitigate the
effects of lock-in insofar as they make it possible for AT&amp;T to raise the costs of McCaw's rivals, and otherwise
adversely affect competition in cellular or wireless service or infrastructure equipment markets. To provide additional
assurance that AT&amp;T will abide by these requirements, Section V.E provides that AT&amp;T may be required to buy
back the cellular infrastructure equipment it has sold to an unaffiliated customer that competes with McCaw if it
violates any of its duties under Sections V.A through V.D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The buy-back obligation will be triggered if the United States determines that AT&amp;T has violated any of its duties
under Sections V.A. through V.D to an unaffiliated cellular carrier in any area(a) where that carrier competes with
McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System and (b) where the unaffiliated cellular carrier has deployed or contract
to deploy an AT&amp;T equipped cellular system prior to entry of the judgment. Thus, if a carrier currently uses AT&amp;T
equipment in a market where it competes with McCaw, and AT&amp;T were to fail to provide software upgrades to that carrier's
system in that market in violation of Section V.B, the buy-back obligation of Section V.E might be triggered. If, however,
AT&amp;T failed to provide software upgrades to that carrier's system in a market in which that carrier did not compete
with McCaw or a McCaw Minority Owned Cellular System, the buy-back obligation would not be triggered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If AT&amp;T is required by the United States to buy equipment back from an unaffiliated customer, the price shall be
the original purchase price of the equipment purchased or contract for by the carrier for use in that system prior to
entry of the judgment, less depreciation as calculated on a straight-line basis over a period of ten years for switches
and eight years for all other hardware. These periods were selected as generally consistent with what the United States
understood to be the useful lives of such equipment. AT&amp;T shall also refund the proportionate share of all monies
paid for unused portions of software licenses, and shall release the customer from future obligations relating to
cellular infrastructure equipment deployed in that system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure that buy-back is meaningfully available to customers in a reasonably timely manner, Section V.D
gives the United States the sole and unreviewable discretion to determine whether that AT&amp;T has violated any
of its duties under Sections V.A through V.D of the judgment. An expeditious determination of whether buy-back has
been triggered is necessary if the locked-in customer is to decide whether to replace a system, and subjecting that
determination to litigation delays would make the buy-back remedy ineffectual. AT&amp;T has irrevocably waived
any right to appeal, contest or otherwise challenge the determination of the United States. It is not intended that
this section create any private rights on behalf of any AT&amp;T customer, nor that any such customer have any right
to appeal, contest or otherwise challenge any determination by the United States pursuant to Section V.E, inasmuch
as the purpose of the section is to aid in the enforcement of ad secure compliance with Sections V.A through V.D of the
judgment. It is the intention of Section V.E that buy-back be a remedy to ensure compliance with the proposed Final
Judgment, and that in determining whether to impose the requirement the United States will consider the seriousness
of the violation, its effect on competition, whether it is part of a pattern of noncompliance, and any other relevant
factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section V.E also permits the United States, in its sole discretion, to appoint an independent fact-finder to conduct
the investigation or factual determination of any issue raised in connection with any alleged violation, reserving
to the United States the right to make a final determination. In the event of such an appointment, the losing party (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the customer or AT&amp;T) shall pay all costs and fees of the fact-finder. The United States will not undertake proceedings
to determine whether buy-back should be required except on the application of and with the consent of the affected
customer, including consent to the payment of costs and fees.

1. Separation Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To help give effect to the equal access and manufacturing provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, Section III requires
that, so long as the judgment is in effect, McCaw and McCaw affiliates that are involved in the operation of wireless
systems and the provisions of local wireless services shall be maintained as corporations or partnerships separate
from AT&amp;T as specified in that section and in the Structural Separation plan to be filed for approval by the United
States pursuant to Section VII.A. Section III requires that McCaw and McCaw affiliates shall be maintained as corporations
and partnerships with separate officers and personnel and separate books, financial or operating records; retain
all wireless service licenses and title and control of the wireless infrastructure equipment used by its systems;
and retain responsibility for the operation of their wireless services, and may not delegate substantial responsibility
for such business activities to AT&amp;T, provided that AT&amp;T may act as McCaw's agent to the extent authorized
in Section IV.F and may provide general corporate overhead and administrative services to McCaw and its affiliates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate the monitoring of AT&amp;T's compliance with equal access and the manufacturing provisions
of Section V of the proposed Final Judgment, Section III.D requires that any interexchange services, wireless infrastructure
equipment and related engineering services or services related to the marketing of wireless services AT&amp;T provides
to McCaw or its affiliates be provided only pursuant to detailed filed tariffs or written contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as discussed above, Section III.E limits the use by McCaw and McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems of AT&amp;T
trademarks and trade names prior to and during the conversion of McCaw Cellular Systems to equal access.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section VII.A obliges AT&amp;T, not less than 90 days after entry of the judgment, to file plans for implementation
of the judgment's terms with the United States. This framework is drawn from similar procedures established in the
MFJ for the implementation of equal access and other nondiscrimination obligations imposed on the Bell Companies,
although in this proposed Final Judgment the Department of Justice has the authority to disapprove plans, and such
disapproval would have significant consequences. In particular, AT&amp;T must file a Structural Separation implementation
plan describing its implementation of Sections III and V.A.4; an Equal Access implementation plan for each McCaw
Cellular System, describing its implementation of Section IV; and a Nonpublic Information implementation plan,
describing its implementation of Section V.A. AT&amp;T must supplement the plans as necessary to describe the implementation
of equal access in subsequently acquired cellular systems and to describe significant changes in the plans. The plans
shall be effective 90 days after filing with the United States, unless disapproved by the United States by written
notice to AT&amp;T that identifies the manner in which the plan is insufficient. The Department may in its discretion
approve a plan in fewer than 90 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to file plans to implement the detailed injunctions, and to obtain the approval of the United States
for such plans is intended to give AT&amp;T, McCaw and the United States flexibility to adopt procedures that best
accomplish the purposes of the judgment, so long as those procedures conform to the language of the judgment, and will
permit the United States to assure that AT&amp;T complies with its obligations under the judgment. In the absence
of an effective Structural Separation plan, AT&amp;T must comply with Section III without modification and may not
perform Proprietary Development for McCaw. In the absence of an effective Equal Access Plan, AT&amp;T may not provide
interexchange services to customers of McCaw Cellular Systems, except under arrangements existing prior to the
merger. In the absence of an effective Nonpublic Information plan, AT&amp;T would be enjoined from selling cellular
infrastructure equipment to any McCaw Cellular Systems or McCaw Minority Owned Cellular Systems that were not equipped
with AT&amp;T equipment prior to the commencement of this action.

3. Modification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The duration of the proposed Final Judgment is ten years. Because it is possible that during that period there could
be major changes affecting competition in wireless telecommunications that could be material to the matters addressed
in this judgment, Section X provides certain grounds for modification in addition to the standards provided by the
common law applicable to the modification of government antitrust consent decrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the equal access provisions of the judgment are modeled on those that the United States has recommended be imposed
on the Bell Companies if they are permitted to provide interexchange service from their wireless systems. Accordingly,
Section X.A permits AT&amp;T or McCaw to seek modification of the equal access provisions of Section IV of the proposed
Final Judgment if Bell Company wireless systems are relieved in whole or in part of the comparable equal access and
nondiscrimination provisions of the MFJ as a result of legislation, judicial orders or agency orders that vacate,
modify, supersede or interpret the provisions of the MFJ. In such an event, the provisions of Section IV of the judgment
shall be modified or vacated to provide the same relief to AT&amp;T or McCaw upon their showing that competitive conditions
do not require a different obligation for AT&amp;T and McCaw and the modification is equitable and in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section X.B provides that changes in wireless telecommunications markets that could be foreseen at this time shall
not be a bar to modification. Specifically, if AT&amp;T or McCaw show that other wireless telecommunications services
have developed as effective competitive alternatives to today's cellular services, or that there have been other
changes or developments affecting a relevant market, a showing that intervening changes have made retention of a
provision of the judgment inequitable shall be sufficient to justify a modification, irrespective of whether those
changes were foreseen or foreseeable when the judgment was entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, to assure that the procedures, practices and obligations of the proposed Final Judgment are implemented
without delay or distraction, AT&amp;T and McCaw have stipulated that they will not move for any modification of the
judgment, except with the consent of the United States, for eighteen months following the commencement of the action.
The United States will not unreasonably without its consent to modifications, and will consent to motions seeking
reasonable modifications that are justified by competitive conditions and are consistent with the purposes of the
judgment and the public interest.

at any time prior to final entry. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over these
actions, and any party may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for their modification, interpretation
or enforcement.

Alternatives To The Proposed Final Judgment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation to seek an injunction to
prevent the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and McCaw. The United States rejected that alternative because the
relief in the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the possible occurrence of conduct the effect of which may be
substantially to lessen competition in the relevant geographic markets for cellular service, wireless infrastructure
equipment and interexchange service to cellular customers. The equal access provisions imposed by the proposed
Final Judgment will open McCaw's cellular systems to competition among interexchange carriers. Because the United
States believes that the proposed Final Judgment adequately protects against possible anticompetitive effects
that might flow from the proposed merger, seeking to enjoin the merger could only serve to prevent the achievement
of economic efficiencies and other potential procompetitive effects that might result from the merger of AT&amp;T
and McCaw.

The balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be
left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest
is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court
is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement

A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they

Waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable
risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving
of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the
litigation.

The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every anticompetitive effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the
future. Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required
for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would
impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.'

The United States submits this memorandum in response to three motions by the Bell Companies for generic wireless

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The United States would support, if modified, that portion of the motion, dated June 20, 1994, of the Bell Companies
for a waiver of the interexchange line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1) of the Decree
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in connection with their ``cellular and other wireless services'' (the ``BOCs' Motion''),
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which seeks the authority to provide interexchange services between cellular exchanges subject to equal access.

The record before the Department on the Bell Companies' motion was submitted to the Court with the Bell Companies'
June 20, 1994, filing. The principal ``wireless'' service here at issue is cellular telephony, sometimes referred
to by the Court, Congress or the Federal Communications Commission as ``mobile radio,'' ``land mobile radio'' or,
most recently, as ``commercial mobile radio service.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1), as amended. The term ``cellular,''
describing a radio telephone service in which frequency is reused by dividing a service area into ``cells,'' also
describes the technology of services that might come to be offered by potential newcomers to these markets (i.e.,
licensees of special mobile radio (``SMR'') or personal communications services (``PCS'') spectrum). However,
for simplicity, the mobile and portable radio telephone service today provided by two licenses in each geographic
area is referred to in this memorandum as ``cellular'' service, as distinguished from SMR or PCS services. Other wireless
services, specifically paging and radiolocation, are discussed below at pp. 42&hyph;45.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The United States opposes at this time that portion of the BOCs' Motion that seeks to redraw the existing cellular
exchange areas to include Rand McNally's Major Trading Area (``MTA''), and adding to those MTAs all prior geographic
relief. The United States would support the BOCs' request for certain incidental relief, if clarified, and the attached
proposed order contains those clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The United States opposes the motions by BellSouth, dated April 15, 1994, and Southwestern Bell, dated June 20,
1994, to remove Section II(A)'s equal access requirement and Section II(D)(1)'s interexchange prohibition, as
applied to their wireless services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All seven BOCs sought that broader relief_the complete removal of the equal access requirement and the interexchange
prohibition_in their waiver request filed with the Department on December 13, 1991. The United States opposes this
relief because none of the BOCs can make the showing required to remove or modify the decree's equal access requirements.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 After extensive investigation and analysis, the Department has determined that the removal of equal access would
substantially reduce competition in interexchange services from cellular exchanges, but that provision of resold
switched interexchange services subject to rigorous equal access conditions would not be likely to reduce competition,
and so advised the BOCs by letter dated June 14, 1994 (copy attached as Exh. 1; exhibits separately bound).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As the United States has advised the Court, the legal staff of the Antitrust Division advised the BOCs in May 1993 that
it would recommend against removal of equal access, and the BOCs then chose to pursue a waiver limited to line-of-business
relief. Memorandum of the United States in Opposition to Motion of BellSouth Corporation for Generic Wireless Relief,
pp. 4&hyph;5 (Apr. 29, 1994). Thus, there was no request for removal of equal access from BOC cellular exchanges pending
when BellSouth or Southerwestern Bell filed their instant motions. Nonetheless, the Department's investigation
and analysis of the BOCs' requests has given it ample basis to oppose these motions on the merits, even though these
motions are, as the Court has recognized, procedurally improper. Order, July 8, 1994, at 4 &amp; n.2.

Summary of Argument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Simply put, BellSouth and Southwestern seek to terminate their cellular exchange subscribers' ability to obtain
interexchange service from competing interexchange carriers, and to require those subscribers instead to obtain
that service from the exchange carrier_subject only to whatever competitive constraint is provided by the existence
of a second cellular carrier. The Department concluded that that minimal constraint was insufficient to prevent
a reduction of competition in cellular long distance. To the contrary, the market power of each cellular duopolist
appears to be sufficient to permit supracompetitive pricing of cellular service; allowing a cellular carrier to
provide interexchange service on an exclusive basis would permit that carrier to charge supracompetitive pricing
for interexchange services as well. The BOCs' unconstrained ability to abuse control of the local exchange provides
additional means to impede competition in interexchange services for cellular customers. See pp. 6&hyph;26 below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, a BOC or its affiliate were to be one of several interexchange carriers available to be chosen by a celluar
subscriber, the presence of that additional choice does not appear likely to result in higher prices for long distance_provided
that genuine equal access is preserved. If the arrangements under which the exchange carrier provides access were
not in fact equal, were discriminatory, or were administered to give the BOCs' own long distance service a significant
advantage, the likely effect would be that other interexchange competitors would be excluded unfairly from competing
for that business. As a result, absent genuine equal access, the Department is not persuaded that BOC entry into cellular
long distance from their cellular exchanges would not reduce competition in the market they seek to enter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether genuine equal access can be preserved when a BOC is providing access to itself and to its competitors is probably
the most difficult issue presented here.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Department believes that genuine equal access can exist in this situation, and has attempted to define the appropriate
equal access arrangements where a Bell Company stands on both sides of the equal access interface. The BOCs have said
that certain of these safeguards are acceptable to them, and have asked the Department to explain others.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The United States conditions its support for the BOCs' motion on these additional safeguards because, without them,
the requested relief does not pass muster under Section VIII(C) of the Decree. See pp. 29&hyph;40 below.

The Court has recognized the dangers of allowing a BOC to provide access to itself and to its competitors. E.g., United

is permitted to offer VSR services that are accessed through its own exchange network, it will have every incentive
to design the exchange system in a manner that disadvantages suppliers of competing VSR service'').

The BOCs also request generic modification of cellular exchange areas, purportedly along MTA lines but grandfathering
all prior cellular geography relief. The United States urges the Court to defer considering this issue. Wholesale
redrawing of the cellular exchange map seems unwise at this time, since the FCC has recently announced that it will
be considering this exact issue in its current rulemaking to decide whether to require that all cellular carriers
grant equal access to interexchange carriers.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Had the BOCs made a compelling showing for the relief they seek, the Court might nonetheless act on that showing. However,
the BOCs have not demonstrated that MTAs generally or individually reflect communities for cellular telephony.

If the Commission mandates equal access, and devises a cellular exchange area map, that map may_but probably will
not_correspond with the LATA map, as adjusted by the Court in the past. The Court will then be faced with the question
whether to modify the Decree map to conform to the FCC map. It would make little sense for the Court to determine whether
yet a third map should be adopted, when the Commission is likely to consider the same issue and where inconsistent results
would be especially problematic.

Because the Department's analysis of the BOCs' Motion turns in large measure on the vitality of equal access, Part

However, the United States believes that its ressponse to BellSouth's motion, and to the similar motion of Southwestern,
will provide a useful framework for analyzing the BOCs' joint motion. In order to understand how equal access should
work in preventing competitive harm, it is first necessary to understand why equal access is essential to prevent

To Remove Equal Access, Movants Must Show at a Minimum that the Removal of Equal Access from their Cellular Exchanges
Would Not Reduce Competition in Long Distance Services from those Exchanges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sought-for removal of the Decree's restrictions on cellular exchanges requires to separate modifications,
subject to two different standards of review. The removal of the interexchange restriction implicates the familiar
standard for contested waivers under Section VIII(C): Will ``the entering BOC will have the ability to raise prices
or reduce output in the market it seeks to enter''? Triennial Review, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
900 F.2d at 296.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of the equal access restriction is not governed by Section VIII(C), which by its terms applies only to modifications
of the line-of-business restrictions of Section II(D)(1). Instead, the motion to remove equal access is governed
by Section VII and the common law standard it incorporates. This Court recently discussed that standard:

[A] party seeking an opposed modification of a consent decree ``bears the burden of establishing that a significant
change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.'' Such a change may be either a ``significant change in factual
conditions or in law.'' Modification may also be appropriate when ``enforcement of the decree without modification
would be detrimental to the public interest.''

Therefore, at a minimum, a modification should not be granted, under either Section VII or Section VIII(C)_where

B. As this Court Has Held Repeatedly, Cellular Exchange Service Is ``Exchange Service'' Subject To the Decree's Equal
Access Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alone among the Bell Companies, BellSouth urges the Court to declare that the Decree's equal access and interexchange
provisions ``do no apply'' to wireless services. (BellSouth Mem. 6, Apr. 15, 1994) BellSouth has not withdrawn this
argument, which the United States rebutted in its earlier opposition to BellSouth's Motion (U.S. Mem. 6&hyph;10,
Apr. 29, 1994) BellSouth nonetheless argues that Section II should not be interpreted to have been intended by the
parties and the Court to be limited to the landline local exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As more fully set forth in our prior brief, BellSouth's argument is frivolous. Whether or not the issue was ``fully
litigated'' (BellSouth Mem. 11) as part of a trial that addressed all aspects of the telecommunications industry,
the Decree's interpretation is settled.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Decree's terms are not themselves limited to landline telecommunications (see Section IV.O, defining ``telecommunications''),
and that understanding was set forth in the Department's filings prior to the Decree's entry.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 AT&amp;T and regional company executives committed prior to divestiture that cellular systems would provide equal
access.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 This Court has repeatedly ruled that cellular services are subject to Section II of the Decree, e.g., Mobile Services
Opinion, 578 F. Supp. at 645; Triennial Review, 673 F. Supp. at 551; AT&amp;T/McCaw Decision, 154 F.R.D. at 4, and has
likewise entered more than 49 waiver orders premised on the proposition that cellular services are subject to Section
II. The Court of Appeals has likewise proceeded on that assumption without questioning this premise.

a competing mobile provider down the road.'' Southwestern Mem. 12. As we show below, two providers is insufficient
for genuine competition in these markets, and Southwestern itself observes internally that these duopolies are
``highly attractive'' because of their ``absence of significant price competition.'' [SWB 218486]

Landline local exchanges can be used to impede competition between cellular providers. Triennial Review, 673 F.
Supp. at 551; see pp. 40&hyph;42 below. Cellular carriers and interexchange carriers both rely on local exchange
facilities for access, interconnection and transport. The Court has recognized that the dangers from BOC control
of an out-of-landline-region cellular system are no greater than BOC control of in-region cellular systems, but
has required both to provide equal access and prohibited both from providing interexchange services. United States

By contrast, the Department's proposed order adds to the protections against discrimination by the landline exchange

There is no reason to believe that the Decree's purposes end where the local landline exchange ends. The Decree's terms
plainly apply to cellular exchanges_as this Court's latest opinion and eight years of consistent application of
the Decree to out-of-region BOC exchange services makes clear. This Court has specifically applied Section II's
interexchange prohibition and other Decree requirements to an out-of-region cellular system, notwithstanding
the fact that the BOC did not control local exchange facilities in the cellular service area. PacTel/CI, 1986&hyph;1
Trade Cas. at 62,060. Subsequent orders, including orders sought by BellSouth and Southwestern, have also applied
Section II to cellular exchanges where the BOC does not provide landline local exchange service.

 This request for a modification turns on whether the modification is necessary to the public interest. Rufo, 112 S.
Ct. at 760. The determination of the public interest, in this specific context, asks whether eliminating equal access
from cellular systems will reduce competition in interexchange markets. The cellular carriers' duopoly status
gives them the monopoly or market power_terms the Court of Appeals has used interchangeably

Standard economics and antitrust texts recognize that monopoly power and market power are functionally identical
concepts. ``Pure monopolists, oligopolists and monopolistic competitors&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;all
possess some degree of power over price, and so we say that they possess monopoly power or market power.'' F. Scherer
&amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 17 (3d Ed. 1990) (hereafter ``Scherer &amp;
Ross''); accord, e.g., 2 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law &para;&para;504, 507, at 325, 330 (1978) (hereafter
``Areeda &amp; Turner''); D. Carlton &amp; J. Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization 97 (1990) (hereafter ``Carlton
&amp; Perloff''). Any purported distinction between ``monopoly power'' and ``market power'' would hardly be meaningful.
See, e.g., Hay, ``Market Power in Antitrust,'' 60 Antitrust L.J. 807, 817&hyph;21 (1992). Professor Hay discusses
varying definitions of ``market power'' and ``monopoly power'' by courts and commenters, noting that at best the
distinction appears to be only that ``monopoly power'' is taken to mean ``a high degree of market power.'' Id. at 817,
818 n. 44. citing Landes &amp; Posner, ``Market Power in Antitrust Cases,'' 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937, 952&hyph;60 (1981).
Professor Hay concludes that ``the key to monopoly (or market) power is the power to control price (i.e., the power
to charge prices above the competitive level), and the power to exclude competition is an ingredient of that power
to control price.'' Hay, 60 Antitrust L. J. at 821.

The crux of the BOCs' original waiver application to the Department, seeking the removal of equal access and the unrestricted
removal of the interexchange prohibition on their wireless businesses, the BOCs argued that ``competition in radio
services is extremely robust,'' that ``competition is flourishing in mobile service markets,'' and that ``without
a showing of market power, the bell companies are plainly entitled to the relief they seek.''

Specifically, all of the BOCs argued in 1991, and the movants argue again, that equal access raises prices for long
distance by permitting non-BOC cellular carriers to buy long distance in bulk but charge retail rates; if equal access
were eliminated, the cellular duopolists would purportedly compete with each other on long distance, driving down
the price. BOC Mem. 45 (Dec. 13, 1991); BOC Reply Mem. 21&hyph;26 (Aug. 3, 1992); BellSouth Mem. 22&hyph;23; Southwestern
Mem. 27. To support this logic, it must be shown that the cellular duopoly is competitive. The facts, however, are just
the opposite. Cellular duopolists plainly have market power in cellular service, and the major premise of the BOCs'
argument therefore fails. It follows inexorably that if the BOC has market power in cellular service, and can exclude
competitors in long distance, it can exclude the benefits of competition that those competitors bring.

Chicago has made a number of changes to improve subscriber revenue. These include: November 1987_changed prime hours
from 8 am to 8 pm to 7 am to 9 pm; March 1990 began charging for `ring time'; *&blank;*&blank;* December 1990 increased
foreign roamer rates from 50&cent;/min to $2/day and 75&cent;/min; May 1991 increased basic monthly access charge
to $19.95. This impacts about 40% of the base. For the future, with rates in general being so low, it is our intent to continue
to increase rates *&blank;*&blank;* We are also evaluating charges for the Telco interconnection fees associated
with their usage. [203139]

Over the past few years, Boston has initiated several key rate changes to improve subscriber revenue per customer.
The changes include the following: July 1989 roamer surcharge introduced; April 1990 changed the billing increment
from the 6-second rounding to full minute; July 1990 introduced a free of peak plan with a premium monthly access charge;
June 1991 increased foreign roamer rates 32%; June 1991 raised monthly access charge $2. *&blank;*&blank;* [A]t
this writing, while we are implementing a rate increase in June 1991. Nynex has filed a tariff which would lower rates
and price their plans below ours across the board. Their actions seem illogical and appear to contradict the steps
needed to offset declining customer usage. *&blank;*&blank;* As for the future, SBMS believes there are other opportunities
to increase rates in Boston, somewhat dependent on our competitor. *&blank;*&blank;* With monthly access charges
relatively low, SBMS will continue efforts to move this fixed charge upward. [203140&hyph;41]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Washington/Baltimore property historically has had the highest subscriber revenue per customer of all the SBMS
properties. *&blank;*&blank;* Washington/Baltimore was one of the last SBMS properties to fall below the $100/month
average subscriber revenue. *&blank;*&blank;* Plan F, a plan designed to add new customers quickly *&blank;*&blank;*
resulted in a large addition of customers, [but] it was priced so inexpensively *&blank;*&blank;* that it drove the
Washington/Baltimore average downward. Plan F has been subsequently dropped. Despite the obvious failure of Plan
F, Washington/Baltimore has introduced a number of changes to improve subscriber revenue per customer *&blank;*&blank;*
Changed the billing increment to full minute rounding; increased roaming rates; *&blank;*&blank;* changed peak
hours *&blank;*&blank;*; increased access charges on low end plans. Washington/Baltimore's future changes will
focus on gradually increasing rates. This will be accomplished mostly through higher access charges and possibly
increased per minute rates.'' [203141&hyph;42]

Dallas subscriber revenue per customer has always been good for a large market. *&blank;*&blank;* Over the last couple
of years, the Dallas property has been the SBMS leader in implementing changes to improve subscriber revenue. Subscriber
revenue per customer has declined 113.8% since 1988 while peak minute usage per customer has dropped 24%. Major factors
contributing to this performance are as follows: Changed from 30 second to full minute billing increments; raised
access charges on economy and basic plans; introduced `free off-peak' which initially resulted in higher peak usage.
Once established, eliminated the offering from low-end plans; increased foreign roamer rates *&blank;*&blank;*
Dallas has also increased activation fees, voice mail rates, and other miscellaneous charges. *&blank;*&blank;*
Dallas is also reviewing charging customers the interconnection fees charged by the Telco associated with customer
usage. In Dallas, this could be as much as 2&cent;/min, which would be a significant boost to subscriber revenue. [203143&hyph;44]

[In l]ate 1989 [in Oklahoma City,] *&blank;*&blank;* roaming rates were increased. In early 1990 billing increments
were changed to full minute rounding. [203146]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to the other SBMS markets, the West Texas properties have been gradually increasing rates by changing the
billing increment, raising access charges and increasing roamer rates. Additional increases in rates will be gradual
as in the past so as not to create a competitive disadvantage. Further upward movement of the access charges is the most
likely course with the de-emphasis of the economy plans close behind. [203146&hyph;47]

 A look at BellSouth's pricing practices in Florida, a state in which BellSouth claims to be at a competitive disadvantage
against its A block competitor, McCaw,
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 is most revealing. Over the 1990&hyph;1993 time period in Miami, the state's largest market, BellSouth's average
per minute revenues for cellular service rose 21 percent, while its market share of service revenues rose from 48 percent
in 1990 to 50 percent in 1993, despite McCaw's larger share of minutes of use. For the years 1991&hyph;1993, BellSouth's
per minute revenues were two percent, nine percent, and 15 percent higher than McCaw's, respectively (in 1990, BellSouth
was one percent lower). In Jacksonville, over the same 1990&hyph;1993 period, BellSouth's per minute revenues rose
more than 30 percent, while McCaw's per minute revenues varied from

The simplest way to examine cellular service prices is to divide service revenues by minutes of use. This calculation
permits an observation undistorted by pricing plans and the like, and often is used by the cellular carriers themselves
to measure their performance. The pricing information in this memorandum is based on comparing service revenue and
minutes of use, based on data provided to the Department by the BOCs and McCaw in connection with our investigations,
and is submitted as Exh. 7.

as it Bars the Proposed AT&amp;T-McCaw Merger, pp. 18&hyph;22 (June 28, 1994) (claiming that BellSouth is at a competitive
disadvantage due to McCaw's ``City of Florida'' plan that allows its subscribers to have service throughout McCaw's
service areas within the entire state at a single ``local'' price). 16 to 25 percent less over the same period. Despite
this disparity, BellSouth retained the greater share of both service revenue (1990's 66 percent share has not surprisingly
dropped to 1993's still impressive 55 percent share) and minutes of use.

Today these cellular systems provide equal access, as the Court has required of BOC cellular systems since 1983. A
contrary ``development would have been entirely inconsistent with the terms and purposes of the decree, and the Court
would not have authorized it.''

Cellular systems ``can prevent their customers from reaching the interchange carriers of their choice by programming

 Therefore, the operators of those cellular systems could reduce competition for long distance service by denying
access to competing carriers and requiring cellular subscribers to obtain long distance at prices not set by competition
between those competing carriers, subject to whatever constraint exists through competition in the cellular market.
As the BOCs have recognized, non-BOC cellular carriers have done just that,

 BellSouth and Southwestern seek to do the same.

The Department's investigation indicated that cellular subscribers value the choice that equal access gives them.
This is particularly true for larger businesses, which seek to connect their cellular services to private networks
offered by interexchange carriers. By doing so, the business user obtains not only access to the features of the private
network, but also the very substantial discounts on long distance prices that are sold as part of the service.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 These are the very discounts that the BOCs seek to obtain (BOC Mem. 26, June 20, 1994); today they can be obtained by customers
of equal access systems, but generally not by others. Indeed the availability of equal access from BOC systems has
pressured

non-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BOCs (notably McCaw) to offer connections to large customers' private networks, in order to retain their business.
Businesses that do not obtain cellular service from equal access cellular systems have no access to these discounts
and services, and have been frustrated in their efforts to reduce their cellular long distance costs.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 While the largest businesses might have the leverage with their cellular providers to gain access for their private
interexchange services, smaller businesses and individuals cannot get those benefits_except where equal access
requires it.

Southwestern also argues that, even if it has market power, it would have no incentive to raise prices of long distance.

Southwestern quotes AT&amp;T's economists, who made the same argument in support of AT&amp;T's efforts to acquire
McCaw: ``Since the monopolist can only charge the monopoly rent once, it has no generally applicable incentive to
favor its affiliate if another competitor can provide the good or service more efficiently.'' Southwestern Bell

The fact, as indicated in Southwestern Bell's own documents, is that a successful strategy for raising prices is to
focus on ancillary services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pp. 16&hyph;18 above. Southwestern Bell has found that it can ``aggressively change(e) elements of subscriber revenue
to mitigate the effect of lower customer usage'' by raising the costs of ancillary services, for example, by ``increased
monthly access charges *&blank;*&blank;* slightly higher roaming *&blank;*&blank;* eliminating `night hours'
and extending peak hours in many of the markets.'' [SWB 203136&hyph;37] If Southwestern Bell finds that the best method
of increasing revenue is to raise the price of roaming rates and access charges, it stand to reason that it would find
it equally feasible and attractive to rise the rates of long distance charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southwestern's ``one monopoly rent'' argument is contrary to theory as well as fact. The theoretical model on which
Southwestern relies depends, in general, on the presence of many key and restrictive conditions, at least 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
four 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of which are not present here. First, as Southwestern Bell acknowledges, the theory is limited to unregulated monopolists.
Cellular duopolists are not universally unregulated: in California, home of 20 percent of the nation's population,
cellular prices are regulated.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 Second, the theory requires that the two inputs (here, cellular service and long distance service) be used in fixed
proportions; if the integrator or user can vary the proportions (by making more or fewer long distance calls) the general
argument fails. Third, the argument does not apply where the firm cannot price discriminate in the downstream market_the
long distance market_without vertical integration. Fourth, and most important, the argument applies only to the
situation in which a monopolist is integrating with a firm in a competitive market; here we have decidedly imperfect
competition in cellular, and (as the BOCs acknowledge) imperfect competition in long distance. The ``one monopoly
rent'' model does not speak to the situation of integrating oligopolists.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The movants point to two developments to support their argument that there has been a significant change in circumstances.
First, they argue that AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw, if permitted by this Court and the FCC, will substantially
change the cellular business by permitting entry of the nation's largest long distance carrier into the local cellular
exchange business. This entry, they argue will place the BOC cellular systems at a substantial competitive disadvantage,
thereby harming consumers. Second, they argue that entry into the wireless business is imminent in the form of SMR
and PCS. They suggest that entry of these new providers will eliminate the need for equal access to preserve competition
in the provision of long distance services to cellular subscribers. Neither of these developments justify the relief
the BOCs seek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed final judgment that the Department has negotiated with AT&amp;T refutes the BOCs' argument that AT&amp;T
will have different equal access rules. Rather, that proposed decree and the order proposed for the BOCs' motion applies
consistent rules to both the BOCs and AT&amp;T. The terms of the AT&amp;T/McCaw judgment, if approved, would expand
the scope of equal access to apply to McCaw cellular exchanges that do not currently provide equal access. As a result,
that judgment will eliminate the competitive disadvantage that the BOCs claim they currently face. Ironically,
granting the BOCs' motion would create the harm they claim they want to end_placing a cellular provider in a position
where it must provide equal access while competing with a provider that need not do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BOCs' other contention is likewise without merit. As yet, there are no SMR or PCS providers of wireless telephony
generally available today. It is, of course, possible that at some point these new technologies will offer wireless
service in competition with today's cellular duopolists. When it will happen and what effect, if any, it will have
on competition in the market for cellular telephone service is now unknown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC has not yet assigned PCS licenses. Indeed, the Commission has not yet even said when licenses will be awarded.
Once the licenses are assigned, the licensees must take a number of time-consuming steps before they can offer service.
They must develop the necessary technology, obtain financing and build networks. The very nature of PCS, including
the services to be provided and the technology to be employed, is not yet settled.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 BellSouth itself told the FCC that ``cellular systems and new PCS licensees will be competitors only to a very limited
degree.''
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 It is, of course, impossible to say how long it will take to develop PCS, but it appears that it will be some time before
PCS service will have any impact on competition for wireless telephony. Any assertion that PCS has changed the competitive
environment is premature at best.

Several firms are in the process of accumulating radio spectrum currently allocated to Special Mobile Radio (SMR)
with the stated intention of offering wireless telephone service. While that service might be closer to deployment
than PCS, when and if it will be available is not yet known. SMR providers currently offer a dispatch service that is
functionally distinct from cellular telephone service.

Dispatch service is used by fleet dispatchers, such as those that issue assignments to taxicabs and utility repair
trucks. Some SMR providers offer interconnection with the public switched telephone network; such service, however,
is far less convenient than cellular service and is used infrequently. SMR customers who need mobile telephone service
usually have SMR and cellular telephone equipment in their vehicles.

Three firms are attempting to convert SMR spectrum to wireless telephone use. Nextel Communications Inc. is the only
firm that has begun construction of an SMR system that would provide cellular-like telephony service. Nextel has
noted that it could still face a number of difficulties, including having substantially less radio spectrum than
that allocated to cellular telephone providers (which could cause its costs to be substantially higher), a limited
number of equipment suppliers and a current inability to offer nationwide service. Nextel's filing also indicates
that its service might not have adequate voice quality.

II. The Boc's Resale of Switched Interexchange Services to Their Cellular Subscribers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Subject to Sufficient Equal Access Safeguards, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices for Interexchange

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BOC's generic wireless waiver motion, unlike the motions by BellSouth and Southwestern, does not seek a modification
of Section II's equal access requirement. The only modification sought is that of Section II(D)(1)'s interexchange
prohibition. In light of AT&amp;T's opposition, the standard for review is that of Section VIII(C): whether the BOCs
have demonstrated that ``there is no substantial possibility that (they) could use (their) monopoly power to impede
competition in the markets (they) seek to enter.'' In the Court of Appeals' formulation, that standard requires the
BOCs to demonstrate that they will not ``have the ability to raise prices'' in those markets. 900 F.2d at 296. The United
States believes that, in an environment in which appropriate equal access safeguards prevent discrimination against
interexchange competitors, that showing is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. BOC Entry as an Additional Choice, Subject to Equal Access, Should Not Result in an Ability to Raise Prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above (pp. 13&hyph;23), the reason that the elimination of equal access would reduce competition is
that it would prevent cellular customers from obtaining the benefit of whatever competition there is in the interexchange
market.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 By contrast, if genuine equal access can be preserved, it seems unlikely that BOC entry into cellular long distance,
in competition with existing providers, would reduce competition in that market. Their entry might be competitively
neutral, or might actually result in lower prices; there does not seem to be a clear reason that_again, subject to genuine
equal access_their entry might raise prices.

There plainly is some competition in interexchange services, notwithstanding the BOCs' arguments. Indeed their
arguments are premised on the proposition that competition in bulk long distance, which they seek to purchase, drives
prices far below AT&amp;T's regulated Tariff 1 rates. See p. 20 &amp; n.28 above. Even at the retail level, the benefits
of divestiture and the equal access regime it created have substantially reduced long distance prices, as the Court
has often noted E.g., AT&amp;T McCaw Decision, 154 F.R.D. at 10.

The BOCs will enter the long distance market with no market share, no existing long distance customers, and no ability
to convert their current cellular customers to their own long distance services_except by persuading customers
that the BOC offers a better service or the same service at a lower price. To the extent the BOCs offer service at prices
below AT&amp;T Tariff 1 prices,
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 their customers (and the customers of other interexchange carriers, who may either demand lower prices or switch
to BOC long distance service) benefit. To the extent the BOCs offer service at prices higher than AT&amp;T's highest
rates, customers have alternatives.

The rates contained in AT&amp;T's Tariff No. 1 (sometimes referred to as ``Basket 1'' or ``MTS'' rates) are AT&amp;T's

The interexchange carriers' arguments against the waiver, as made to the Department during its investigation, do
not challenge this proposition. They challenge instead whether the BOC's provision of access to itself and its competitors
can ever be considered ``equal,'' and whether the BOC's control of the landline exchange overwhelms the analysis.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 The adequacy of equal access (under the Department's proposal, rather than under the BOC's) is discussed at pp. 29&hyph;40

If genuine equal access is provided, the BOC will not have an unfair advantage over its competitors by reason of its
providing access to itself and to its competitors. If they have an equal chance to gain customers, the BOCs' competitors
will not be foreclosed from the cellular exchange. If the BOCs can only gain business by charging lower prices, that
would not seem likely to lead to the higher prices that the Court of Appeals noted was the test for Section VIII(C). These
arguments may seem tautological, but their import is that the focus of the inquiry should be on the question whether,
and under what conditions, a BOC cellular system can provide access to itself and its competitors without creating
a substantial risk that it will discriminate in providing that access. We now turn to that question.

B. Appropriate Safeguards are Required To Protect Against Discrimination in Access or Presubscription by the Cellular
Exchange Operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The structure of the Decree rests on equal access. AT&amp;T's discrimination against competing long distance carriers
formed the basis of the antitrust violation, and preventing discrimination by the exchange access provider was and
is the key to allowing competitive long distance markets to develop. Decree Opinion, 552 F. Supp. at 165. Recognizing
that merely enjoining discrimination would be insufficient to prevent that discrimination, the Decree required
a permanent separation of AT&amp;T's exchange and long distance businesses, id. at 165, 172, and prohibited the Bell
companies from integrating into the long distance business. Id. at 177. However, the Court recognized that the BOCs
might lose their monopoly power over time; the Court therefore added Section VIII(C) to the Decree, to permit entry
by the BOCs when that entry would be unlikely to reduce competition. Id. at 195.

To determine whether that entry is now appropriate, the Court should consider whether sufficient safeguards exist
or have been proposed to prevent the danger that the access provider, in providing access to itself as well as its competitors,
could discriminate against those competitors in the provision of exchange access.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 As in 1982, simply enjoining discrimination is insufficient protection; specific proscriptions are appropriate
in light of the dangers presented, and those proscriptions should be adopted in a manner that will make detection and

To further the enforcement of these conditions, the Department believes that the grant of authority to provide interexchange
services should be subject to the following sanctions. First, that the Court should have the authority to withdraw
the waiver if a BOC violates the equal access requirements of the waiver and of the Decree; and, second, that the Court
reserve the authority to impose civil fines for violations. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(5).

The Department has considered these questions in the limited context of cellular services, and believes that appropriate
safeguards can be devised_although the Department also believes that the safeguards offered by the BOCs are insufficient,

markets.

The Department does not believe that the BOCs should be prohibited from providing any interexchange services until
they can demonstrate that competition would not be reduced were they allowed entry into interexchange services generally.
The Department is aware of, and shares, the Court's concern about ``piecemeal waivers.'' Triennial Review, 673 F.
Supp. at 545; see also United States v. Western Elec. Co., 777 F.2d 23, 29 (D.C. Cir. 1985), but believes that wireless
markets (as defined in the Department's proposed order) are sufficiently discrete to allay these concerns.

The BOCs have said that ``for the most part, [the Department's] conditions and clarifications appear to be acceptable,
though some clarifications may be necessary.'' (BOC Mem. 16) We discuss these issues in Section 1, pp. 31&hyph;36
below. The BOCs have, however, objected to the Department's resale and marketing restrictions. (BOC Mem. 16&hyph;19)

to cellular carriers and that the benchmark for discrimination is the access the BOC provides to itself, rather than
what it provides to AT&amp;T, the original language of Section II(A). Section VIII(L)(3)(a)(3) of the proposed order
also makes explicit the implicit requirement of equal access, that the prices for cellular exchange not vary with
the interexchange carrier chosen:

The Department's proposed order adds a new Section VIII(L) to the Decree. Section VIII(L)(1) contains definitions.
Section VIII(L)(2) provides the authorization for specific interexchange services to be provided in connection
with wireless exchange services. Section VIII(L)(3) contains specific equal access requirements related to that
authority. Section VIII(L)(4) provides for the filing of compliance plans with the Department, and Section VIII(L)(5)
specifies sanctions for violations of the modification or of equal access.

Section VIII(L)(3)(a)(4) imposes an equivalent restriction on the sale of interexchange services; i.e., to the
extent a BOC provides interexchange services to the customers of its cellular affiliates and to the customers of competing
cellular affiliates, it may not vary the price depending on which cellular exchange service the customer buys. This
requirement, which has been questioned by the BOCs (BOC Mem. 22), is necessary to give meaning to the unbundling requirement.
Absent this constraint, the BOC could adjust the price of its interexchange service to create combinations of services
that its long distance competitors could not match. Moreover, it would be decidedly procompetitive if the BOCs were
to compete for long distance from each other's cellular exchanges and from McCaw cellular exchanges. A similar requirement
is imposed upon AT&amp;T and McCaw under the consent decree agreed to between them and the United States. AT&amp;T

In addition, the Department's proposed order explicitly makes Section II(B)'s requirements of nondiscrimination
in the provision of technical information, interconnection and provision for planning of facilities binding on
BOC commercial mobile service providers. The Department objected to the BOCs' earlier request to be allowed to give
themselves preferential routing and collocation. The BOCs' proposed equal access plan as presented to the Court
affirms that they will not give themselves those preferences. (BOC Model Equal Access Plan, p. 2). The Department
believes that 60 days' notice of changes to the network is reasonably necessary to allow competing interexchange
carriers sufficient time to modify their networks, and the BOCs have accepted that requirement. Id.

Wireless Exchange Services mean commercial mobile services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1); provided, however,
that BOC Wireless Exchange Services are limited to services provided by corporations that have been established
as separate subsidiaries from the BOC's local telephone exchange companies (``LECs''), and provided, further,
that the principal facilities used to provide Wireless Exchange Services, including the MTSO and radio base stations,
are physically and operationally separate from LEC facilities.

Proposed Order, Section VIII(L)(1)(c). The purpose of this restriction to ``physically and operationally separate''
networks is to distinguish wireless networks that are physically separate from the landline exchange, such as today's
cellular networks, from networks that might be tightly integrated with the local exchange. It is unclear whether
such a PCS service could be offered by anyone other than the local exchange itself, and therefore it might not be appropriate
to allow BOCs to provide interexchange services from the network, just as it is not appropriate today for the BOCs to
provide interexchange services from their landline exchanges, on these conditions. The BOCs based their proposal,
and the Department evaluated this proposal, in light of current cellular architectures, and the Department therefore
recommends limiting the waiver to commercial mobile services offered from networks that are fully distinct and separated_both
physically and structurally_from the local exchange.

services excluded by the Department's proposed order (BOC Mem. 12); the Department's proposal makes that limitation
explicit on the face of the order.

Such remote locations may include a network address (such as a telephone or paging number) stored at the MTSO, or a voice
mailbox or similar storage facility. In such cases, the BOC may provide only the interexchange portion of the call

Proposed Order, Section VIII(L)(2)(b). This proposal reflects what the BOC's seek: the right to forward calls to
the cellular subscriber's chosen destination (including a voice mailbox), according to the subscriber's PIC, rather
than that of the call originator. The call originator might have thought he was making a local call, when the subscriber
had forwarded her phone to a distant city; the subscriber pays for that long distance segment and, if she chose the BOC
as her PIC, the BOC would carry the call. (See BOC Mem. 13)

This service which would be offered to subscribers of Wireless Exchange Carriers would permit use of a number that
the subscriber could give out that would permit callers that were willing to pay charges for wireless services to reach
the subscriber through the wireless terminal. It is the Department's understanding that the availability of this
service may be important to the continued rapid growth of the wireless industry and that the feasibility of this offering
is likely to depend on whether the caller will know in advance what the charges for the call will be. Thus, it is contemplated
that for this service to be successful, carriers may need to average airtime and toll charges so that a flat per-minute
rate may be associated with the service. Thus, an exception to the requirement that separate charges for wireless
access and interexchange services is appropriate in this instance.

Equal Access plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department concurs in the BOC's proposal that they provide equal access plans, but Section VIII(L)(4)(b) of the
Department's proposed order specifies the matters that those plans should describe:

Each BOC's compliance plans shall include a plan for implementing equal access on a nondiscriminatory basis in the
context where the BOC access provider is also a competing interexchange carrier. These plans shall include detailed
procedures for implementing equal access from any Wireless Exchange System where a BOC acquires a controlling interest
after the effective date of this Section VIII(L), procedures for identifying to new Wireless Exchange Service customers
their choices for interexchange services, the terms and conditions whereby unaffiliated interexchange carriers
will be offered the opportunity to interconnect at any BOC Wireless Exchange Systems MTSO, the procedures for disseminating
to interexchange carriers any planned changes in network services or plans for implementing new services that may
affect such carriers services, procedures for assuring that any personnel of a BOC Wireless Exchange Carrier that
is involved in the marketing of interexchange services shall not have access to proprietary information of other
interexchange carriers, including but not limited to network interconnection arrangements and lists of interexchange
carrier customers or their usage statistics; a plan for the separation of the personnel that market interexchange
services from the personnel that administer presubscription; a plan for implementing Calling Party Pays service
if the BOC wishes to offer such a service; a plan describing its procedures to assure compliance with Section VIII(L)(2)(e)
of this Decree (including a plan for providing nondiscriminatory access to IS&hyph;41 or similar databases for all
carriers); and a plan for implementing CDPD service.

The effect of these sections is to make clear what matters the equal access plans should discuss, and that there is no
authority to provide interexchange services in the absence of an effective plan. A plan is only effective if not disapproved
by the Department. The requirement to submit plans and the Department's responsibility to review them_and the Department's
right to reject inadequate plans_should relieve the Court of the need to administer the minutiae of equal access,
and should provide the BOCs sufficient flexibility in the offering of services, without the need to return to the Court
for ministerial matters. Interested parties will have an opportunity to review the equal access plans and to alert
the Department to deficiencies they perceive.

2. The Resale Will Eliminate Most Risks of Discriminatory Interconnection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposes that the BOCs' authority to provide interexchange services be limited to the resale of switched
interexchange services provided by others. The Department has also indicated that its current view is that the BOCs
should purchase no more than 45 percent of their interexchange needs from single source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BOCs tell the Court, as they told the Department in seeking the Department's support, that ``as a practical matter,
*&blank;*&blank;* it is likely that the BOCs will mostly act as resellers of switched services in this context.''
(BOC Mem. 16) Nonetheless, the BOCs seek the authority to build and use interexchange facilities. The Department
believes that limiting the BOCs to switched resale will substantially reduce the dangers of discrimination, and
proposed that limitations on that basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By limiting the BOCs to reselling switched interexchange services, the BOCs will not be able to construct or operate
facilities, and therefore they will be unable to give their own facilities favorable treatment. Since they will be
reselling other carriers' services, any discrimination aimed at favoring the BOC's service would be readily apparent
at least to the carriers whose services the BOC was reselling. The benefits of that discrimination would flow to that
carrier for all of its traffic, and that carrier would be competing with the BOC. Therefore, the risks of discrimination
are here accompanied by a proportionately smaller benefit, reducing the likelihood of that discrimination. These
dangers are further reduced by the requirement that the BOC obtain not more than 45 percent of any system's interexchange
services from any one provider, thereby requiring the BOC to use three carriers and leaving less opportunity for the
BOC to discriminate against other carriers, and likewise increasing the difficulty of collusive behavior.

The BOCs have objected to this requirement as preventing them from obtaining the bulk discounts on long distance services
that would make it possible for them to resell interexchange services. (BOC Mem. 17) However, the BOCs have not provided
any evidence that the anticipated volumes will not entitle them to substantial discounts under currently filed tariffs,
at reasonable volume predictions. The Department has requested further information from the BOCs on this subject.
Although the BOCs argue that the 45 percent ``condition would prevent the BOCs from putting price pressure on any''
interexchange carrier (BOC Mem. 17), the Supreme Court's recent holding that all interexchange carriers must file
tariffs, MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Tel. Co., 114 S. Ct. 2223 (1994), limits the concern
that the BOCs would be unable to take advantage of tariffed bulk discounts.

3. Marketing and Unbundling Requirements Are Necessary To Ensure that Presubscription Provides a Genuine Opportunity
for Competing Interexchange Carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meaningful equal access is premised on the idea that procedures can be put in place to provide competing interexchange
carriers a reasonable opportunity to complete for customers' business. Merely requiring the BOC to offer presubscription
seems insufficient, if the BOC can bundle cellular and interexchange services together in blended, single-price
offerings that do not permit customers the opportunity to compare the BOC's offerings with its competitiors'; if
the BOC can market its interexchange service together with its cellular service, while requiring the customer to
make separate inquiries to discover the availability of competing carriers; or if the BOC can provide a combined bill
for its cellular and long distance service, while requiring its competitors' customers to receive and pay two separate
bills.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's proposed order prevents these measures, and thus prevents the BOC from marketing or offering services
that its interexchange competitors cannot match by reason of the BOC's control of the duopoly cellular exchange.
To the extent the BOC designs service offerings that are attractive to customers, and successfully markets them,
the BOCs will properly obtain business. But their interexchange competitors will likewise be able to make offerings
that might be attractive to customers, on the same basis as the BOCs can.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific restrictions, which are set forth in Section VIII(L)(3)(f) and (g) of the Department's proposed order,
require a separation of the persons responsible for administering presubscription (referred to as the ``wireless
exchange sales force'') from persons who market the BOC's interexchange services (the ``long distance sales force'').
However sold, the BOCs would be required to state separately the prices for cellular service and long distance service,
and would not be permitted to offer blended or bundled service offerings. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(a)(5).
Nothing would prohibit them from making claims in marketing or advertising that either their cellular service or
their long distance service is more favorably priced than their competitors'. If a BOC provides its customers with
a single bill for cellular and interexchange service, it would be required to permit similar billing arrangements
by its long distance competitors. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department would not seek to preclude the BOCs from marketing the long distance services it believes they should
be allowed to provide, and believes that the long distance sales force should be permitted to sell cellular service
as well. However, this sales force should not be given any advantages not also given to the BOC's interexchange competitors:
It should receive any cellular customer lists at the same time and under the same terms as the BOCs' competitors, and
should not receive any additional information about those customers (eg. their cellular telephone numbers, their
usage patterns) unless the same information is provided to competing interexchange carriers.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 The long distance sales force is also required to advise customers that they have a right to choose interexchange carriers.
Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(g)(3).

Those carriers would be restricted in their use of that information to the marketing of interexchange services; interexchange
carriers affiliated with wireless carriers would not be able to use this confidential information to market wireless
services. The largest interexchange carrier, AT&amp;T, is subject to the same separation and marketing restrictions.
AT&amp;T/McCaw Decree, Section IV.C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``wireless exchange sales force,'' the group responsible for administering presubscription, includes salespersons
in retail stores and those who receive inquiries. Those salespersons, like persons selling BOC cellular service
today, would be required to provide the customer with a ballot to select an interexchange carrier, and would not be
allowed to sell long distance service or advocate that the customer purchase BOC long distance service. Proposed
Order, &sect;VII(L)(3)(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not agree with the BOCs that these restrictions are ``unduly restrictive.'' (BOC Mem. 18) Rather,
these marketing and billing restrictions are necessary to allow the BOCs to market their interexchange services
while providing their competitors with the opportunity to compete on equal terms, thereby providing consumers with
a meaningful opportunity to make an informed choice. By comparison, the BOC proposed order and equal access plan are
silent (or at best ambiguous) as to whether bundled service offerings are permitted, and whether competing interexchange
carriers will be permitted to create their own bundles.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 The Department's proposal requires unbundled offers, and requires the BOCs to provide their long distance competitors
with customer lists at the same time as that information is provided to their long distance sales force.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 Under these arrangements, carriers that do not control cellular exchanges, and cannot themselves provide both cellular
and long distance service, nonetheless have an opportunity to market long distance services to BOC cellular customers.

The BOC order does require that exchange access and exchange services of such access be provided to interexchange
carriers ``on an unbundled basis, that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service
provided by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof.'' BOC Proposed Order &sect;I.4,p.3. If there were separations
between the cellular and long distance sales operations, this language presumably would prohibit the BOC from ``selling''
cellular service to an affiliated packager at lower prices than offered to competing interexchange carriers, and
the BOC could not bundle cellular and long distance services in combinations that other interexchange carriers could
not match. However, in the absence of such separations, it is unclear whether the BOCs' proposed order would in fact
prevent discriminatory bundling, and it would be difficult for the Department to determine, in attempting to enforce
the conditions to this waiver order, whether the BOC had discriminated. The Department's proposed order makes these
discriminations clearly prohibited and more easily detected.

The BOC equal access plan provides that a Bell cellular affiliate ``may use customer names, addresses and mobile numbers
to market its own interexchange operations only if it provides that information on the same terms and conditions to
unaffiliated'' interexchange carriers. (BOC Model Equal Access Plan, p. 4) However, absent separation between
the cellular and long distance sales forces, there can be no genuine assurance that the BOC will in fact not receive
these customer names before its competitors do, and little opportunity to enforce this requirement.

C. Appropriate Safeguards Are Also Required To Prevent Abuse of the Landline Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also true, as AT&amp;T has stressed, that the possibility exists that the BOCs could use their control of the local
exchange to discriminate against competing interchange carriers, who rely on the local exchange for their access
to both the wireline and nonwireline cellular exchanges. Cellular exchanges likewise relies on the local exchange
for interconnection to local exchange customers, for access to interexchange carriers, and often for transport
between cellular switches and cell sites within the cellular network.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the dangers of discrimination in these local landline exchange facilities is present, that danger can be constrained
by injunction. The Department's proposed order specifically enjoins discrimination by the local exchange, directed
either at competing wireless providers or at competing interexchange providers. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(a)
(1), (2). In addition, Section VIII(L)(1)(c) and VIII(L)(2) make clear that the authority to provide interexchange
services is limited to the BOC's Wireless Exchange Service, which must be physically and structurally separate from
its local telephone operations. The long distance sales force in particular must be a distinct sales force, with separate
managers, from any sales force that sells products or services of any local telephone company. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(g)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements are sufficient to prevent discrimination in this narrow circumstance. Not only would such discrimination
be prohibited explicitly, and subject to civil fine and loss of the authority to provide wireless interexchange services,
Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(5), but it would also be quite difficult to accomplish effectively, under the restriction
that the BOCs be limited to reselling other carriers' switched interexchange services. The resale requirement reduces
the risk of discrimination in the local exchange, possibly even more than in the cellular switch. The BOCs will be sending
their own long distance traffic over several carriers' facilities, which are also handling traffic originating
in the local exchange (for which the BOCs may not compete). In addition, the BOCs will be sending their interexchange
calls to interexchange carriers that will presumably also be serving their own customers that are subscribers of
the BOC wireless service. If the quality of transmission, for example, was significantly better for the BOC's customers,
it would be readily apparent to the interexchange carrier. In fact, any effort by the BOC to degrade the transmission
of competitors' traffic might well result in adversely affecting its own interexchange customers. Moreover, since
there are two cellular providers in each market, a BOC considering a strategy of degrading competitors' interexchange
connections might be concerned that customers would not associate their service problems with the interexchange
service, and thus might switch cellular carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also significant that the direct connection option exists for interexchange carriers deciding to obtain exchange
access to their wireless customers without routing their calls through the LEC's switched network. The existence
of this possibility could well deter discriminatory behavior out of concern that to do so would risk loss of access
charge revenues. The benefits of discrimination in these circumstances are slight, and the risks of detection may
be more substantial.

D. Provisions for Incidental Relief from the Decree's Equal Access Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BOC's motion also seeks some incidental relief from the Decree's equal access requirements in connection with
their paging and radiolocation businesses, and in connection with certain aspects of their cellular businesses.
Subject to some minor clarification, the Department believes that these modifications (which AT&amp;T has not previously
opposed) are in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VIII(L)(2) of the Department's proposed order, which parallels Section II(a) of the BOCs' proposed order,
states that the Decree's equal access and nondiscrimination requirements shall not apply to paging (with acknowledgement)
or radiolocation. These are substantially competitive businesses, without the market power of cellular, and the
Court has already granted generic interexchange relief for one-way paging.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 The equal access relief confirmed here was implicit in that paging order, but this order confirms that a BOC paging
affiliate may combine interexchange services necessary to provide paging with the paging services itself, and need
not hand off interexchange links within the paging network to other carriers. The department's proposed order confirms
that this relief does not relive BOC local exchanges of their equal access and nondiscrimination obligations towards
unaffiliated paging companies; and that it does not implicitly grant the BOCs' motion for a waiver for 800 access to
paging, which is now pending with the Court (and which the Department supports). (U.S. Mem., Feb. 1, 1993)

Section VIII(L)(2)(e) of the Department's proposed order, which parallels Section II(b) of the BOCs' proposed order,
provides that BOC cellular systems can transmit IS&hyph;41 and comparable administrative messages on a non-equal
access basis, so long as they do not discriminate in favor of their own interexchange carrier in doing so. IS&hyph;41
is an industry standard that permits cellular systems to signal each other in order to, among other things, locate
roaming subscribers and determine whether their cellular phones are available to receive calls. Only if the signaling
messages indicate that the call can be completed is a voice path established to complete the call. The proposed order
will permit the BOC cellular systems to use IS&hyph;41 to locate their subscribers; they will then be required to turn
over the call to the customers's PIC (which could be the BOC or an unaffiliated carrier) to complete the call. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section VIII(L)(2)(3) of the Department's proposed order permits the BOCs to resell other cellular carriers' cellular
services, whether or not those other carriers provide equal access. Today the BOC can resell other BOCs' cellular
services, but not the services of cellular carriers that bundle cellular and interexchange services. This relief
will permit the BOCs to resell the services of non-BOC cellular carriers, and thereby attempt to provide greater regional
or national coverage, in competition with other providers who may seek to offer national presence (such as AT&amp;T).
This section also addresses the situation in which the customer of a non-equal access cellular system roams into the
BOC cellular system. If that customer does not have a PIC, the BOC may complete that customer's long distance calls
by using the BOC's long distance services.

The proposed modification, section VIII(L)(2)(f), would permit the BOCs to provide interexchange telecommunications
services in connection with the offering of Cellular Digital packet Data Service (``CDPD''). Although not specifically
requested by the BOCs, the department is including this service in its Proposed Order in view of the fact that a similar
provision was included in the Final Judgment proposed in connection with AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw. AT&amp;T/McCaw
Decree, &sect;IV.H, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;II.F. This provision would allow interexchange transport of packetized data from the cell sites to centralized
points before it is routed through a switching or routing device that is capable of handing it off onto separate facilities
specified by the customer. At this centralized point the modification specifies that the CDPD provider will hand
the message off to (or receive a message from) an Internet Node within the same exchange area, or transfer it to a private
network facility or interexchange carrier specified by the customer. Interexchange facilities used by a BOC to transport
the messages to and from the centralized points must be obtained from an unaffiliated interexchange carrier and the
BOCs are not authorized to provide the interexchange carrier service of transporting the messages from the centralized
points. The procedures for specifying the selection of the customer interexchange carrier for CDPD must be specified
in the BOC's compliance plans before they may implement this provision. The Department's recommendation for this
provision is based on our understanding that it will significantly facilitate the early provision of this important
service especially in area of relatively low demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions give the BOCs the ability to offer and provide cellular services in a reasonably efficient manner,
without seriously impairing the objectives of the decree's equal access provisions. None of these modifications
will prevent a cellular customer from obtaining interexchange services from the carrier of their choice; these provisions
will only permit the BOCs to offer cellular services to more customers more efficiently.

The BOCs also seek relief expanding the areas in which they are permitted to offer local service to Major Trading Areas
defined by Rand McNally, plus existing cellular service areas as they have been expanded by the Court in 49 cellular
waiver orders, plus adjacent Rural Service Areas (``RSAs''). As a result, several of the calling areas that would

Enlarging local calling scopes moves traffic from the interexchange market, which is at least somewhat competitive,
to the celluar market, which in the Department's view is less competitive. By AT&amp;T's estimate, fully 25 percent
of all interexchange traffic is within MTAs.

they outweighed, on this limited basis, the dangers to fair competition.''

the Court has relied. While ``patterns of traffic'' may exist among any two cities chosen at random (in that someone
probably went between them once), MTAs do not purport to represent areas within which people move on a daily basis.

Motion of BellSouth Corporation for a Waiver of Section II(D) of the Modification of Final Judgment to Allow BellSouth
Corporation To Provide Integrated MultiLATA Cellular Service, May 9, 1991. BellSouth made virtually no attempt
to show a community of interest for the State of Florida. Rather, BellSouth relied principally on arguments that its
cellular service faces competition. The only evidence of community of interest for the State of Florida that BellSouth
offers is that the Department of Transportation has observed that a certain number of vehicles crossed LATA boundaries
on a particular day. The fact that vehicles left the Tampa LATA on a particular day provides no support for the proposition
that ``subscribers will want and expect to be in communication with mobile units in this traffic which regularly crosses
from one LATA to another,'' Mobile Services Decision, 578 F. Supp. at 648, much less that people drive from Tampa to
Miami as regularly as they drive from New York City to northern New Jersey. See also Southwestern Bell's Response to
Comments (March 1, 1990) (``there is no requirement in Section VIII (c) that a BOC must make a showing that a ``community
of interest'' exists before the Court can grant a MultiLATA cellular waiver'').

Thus, for example, the Los Angeles MTA includes Las Vegas; the New York City MTA includes Burlington, Vermont; the
San Francisco MTA includes Reno, Nevada; and the Spokane, Washington, MTA includes Billings, Montana_a distance
of nearly 1,000 miles (according to Rand McNally).

It is also suggested that the FCC's decision to license some PCS spectrum blocks using MTAs indicates that MTAs are
appropriate local calling areas. (BOC Mem. 43&hyph;44) The FCC has also ``embraced'' Basic Trading Areas, which
are substantially smaller than LATAs. FCC PCS Order &para;76, at 7733. None of these determinations of the appropriate
size of radio licenses_the context in which the Commission considered MTAs as providing ``economies of scale and
scope necessary to promote the development of low cost PCS equipment'' (BOC Mem. 44, quoting FCC PCS Order &para;75,
at 7733)_reflects a determination by the Commission of the appropriate local calling ares for cellular systems providing
equal access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That issue will be taken up if the Commission decides to impose equal access on cellular or other wireless carriers,
an issue now open for comment before it. The United States proposes that the Court defer redefining cellular local
calling areas until the Commission has acted; the BOCs, having argued that the Commission's ``embrace'' of MTAs in
another context is determinative, resist allowing the expert agency to attempt to address this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would not be sensible for the Court and the Department to embark on this mapmaking project again, at the same time
as the Commission is considering the issue. The result could be that, instead of the one cellular calling area map now
devised by the Court, there could be three maps: The old adjusted LATA map, the new map drawn by the Court (whether MTAs
or something else), and a different map developed by the FCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It seems more sensible for the FCC to act first. If the Commission adopts equal access, and draws a map, then the Court
can determine whether that map addresses the needs of the Decree and, if so, conform the Decree's cellular LATAs to
the FCC's decision. If the FCC determines not to impose equal access, then the Court can revisit this issue_and the
BOCs can attempt to make a more persuasive case, or seek a more reasonable alternative. In the meanwhile, the Department
will consider the pending cellular geography waivers, which had been deferred, to be ripe for decision, and will advise
the BOCs shortly whether it will support or oppose specific waivers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the motions of BellSouth and Southwestern Bell for complete removal
of the equal access and provisions of the Decree as applied to wireless businesses; and should grant the motion of the
Bell Companies for a waiver of the interexchange restriction subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the accompanying
proposed order.

Dear Mr. Kellogg: The Department has concluded its investigation and analysis of the Bell Companies' request, submitted
as modified on November 12, 1993, for a waiver of the interexchange line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1)
of the Modification of Final Judgment (``MFJ'') as applied to their ``wireless'' businesses, and other relief (the
``Generic Wireless Waiver''). The Bell Companies (``BOCs'') may proceed to file their motion for that waiver with
the Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to support the Generic Wireless Waiver, as proposed in the Bell Companies' submissions of
September 24 and November 12, 1993, only to the extent stated in this letter. The Department reserves its right and
responsibility to modify its position if it appears to the Department, in light of comments of interested persons,
further investigation or subsequent developments, that a change of position is appropriate. The discussion herein
follows the form of the BOCs' proposed order of September 24, 1993, as modified by your letter of November 12, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Interexchange Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the Department intends to support the BOCs' request for a waiver of the interexchange prohibition, subject to the
conditions stated in the proposed order and model equal access plan, on the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. That the authority to provide interexchange services is limited to the provision by resale of switched interexchange
services. Our current views is that not more than forty-five percent of any BOC cellular system's resold interexchange
service should be purchased from any one interexchange carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. That the conditions on the proposed waiver apply to any entity that is a BOC within the meaning of the MFJ.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These conditions likewise apply to the relief sought in Sections II(b), II(c) and III of the proposed order, and to
the transmission of IS&hyph;41 or comparable administrative messages pursuant to Section II(a). The Department
recommends that Section II(a) be separated into two sections for ease of reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
c. That the scope of the authority to provide interexchange services is restricted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Telecommunications originating in a cellular exchange,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 as currently configured, or other similarly configured networks, distinct from the landline local exchange, wherein
radio is used to connect the network with a customer who is not at a fixed location. The BOCs have based their reasoning
supporting a waiver and the design of their proposed order and equal access plan on the architecture of their existing
cellular systems, and the Department will not support a waiver that is not limited to such systems or systems with similar
architectures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
``Cellular exchange'' within the meaning of this letter refers to an exchange service offering commercial mobile
services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. &sect;332(d)(1), in the 800 MHz radio bands. The Department understands that such
exchange services are provided by companies that are, pursuant to FCC regulation, separate subsidiaries from local
telephone exchange companies (``LECs''), and that the principal facilities used to provide cellular exchange service,
e.g., switching equipment and radio base stations, are physically and operationally separate from LEC facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Telecommunications intended by the originator to be directed to a cellular exchange, as described above, but
that the cellular exchange subscriber has forwarded to another destination (including a voice mailbox or similar
storage facility). The authority to provide interexchange services under this condition is limited to that portion
of the interexchange service from the cellular system to which the telecommunication was directed by the originator
to the ultimate destination. This condition specifically does not authorize the provisions of interexchange services
from the point of origination to the cellular system (e.g., an ``800 access to cellular'' service), which the BOCs
have not sought in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. That the authority be conditioned on an explicit requirement that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell operating telephone company shall offer to all interexchange carriers exchange access and exchange
services for such access on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange
service provided by the Bell company or any affiliate thereof.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell operating telephone company shall not discriminate between any mobile service provided by the Bell company
or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated mobile service provider or between an interexchange service provided
by the Bell company or an affiliate thereof and any nonaffiliated interexchange carrier in the:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(a) establishment and dissemination of technical information and interconnection standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(b) interconnection and use of the Bell operating telephone company's telecommunications service and facilities
or in the charges for each element of service; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(c) provision of new services and the planning for and implementation of the construction and modification of facilities
used to provide exchange access.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof providing commercial mobile service within the meaning of 47
U.S.C. 332(d)(1) shall offer to all interexchange carriers exchange access and exchange services for such access
on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service provided
by the Bell company or any affiliate thereof.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
Implicit in this concept and in the concept of equal access is that the price, quality and terms upon which cellular
service is offered shall not vary with the customer's choice of interexchange carrier. That proposition should be
affirmed explicitly:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``A Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof shall not sell or contract to sell wireless service at a price, term
or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains interexchange service from the Bell Operating Company
or an affiliate thereof.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department believes that the same proposition should apply to the sale of interexchange service:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``To the extent that a Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof provides interexchange services pursuant to this
order to unaffiliated wireless services providers or customers thereof, the Bell Operating Company shall not sell
or contract to sell interexchange service at a price, term or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains
wireless service from the Bell Operating Company or an affiliate thereof.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, in order for these guarantees to be meaningful, the Department believes that the Bell Operating Companies
should be required to state separately the prices, terms or rate plans for (a) wireless services and (b) interexchange
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
g. That the authority to provide interexchange services be conditioned on an explicit requirement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Each Bell Operating Company or affiliate thereof providing commercial mobile service within the meaning of 47
U.S.C. 332(d)(1) shall not discriminate between any interexchange service provided by the Bell company or an affiliate
thereof and any nonaffiliated interexchange service carrier in the:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(a) establishment and dissemination of technical information and interconnection standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(b) interconnection and use of the Bell Operating Company's or affiliate's telecommunications service and facilities
or in the charges for each element of service; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(c) provision of new services and the planning for and implementation of the construction and modification of facilities
used to provide exchange access.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. That the BOCs shall file with the Department of a mobile equal access plan, which plan shall not be effective (1) until
90 days after filing, if not disapproved by the Department, or (2) if disapproved by the Department; that there be no
authority to provide interexchange services pursuant to this waiver until an equal access plan has become effective;
and that the plan at a minimum contains the specifications contained in the BOC Model Equal Access Plan submitted on
September 24, 1993, as modified by your letter of November 12, 1993, except in the following particulars:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Department believes that it is necessary in the provision of equal access that interexchange services not
be sold by the persons selling exchange services and who are required to administer presubscription (the ``cellular
sales force''). It is the Department's contemplation that this restriction would apply to retail store agents and
to other BOC salespersons who receive inquiries by prospective subscribers, i.e., salespersons who handle ``incoming''
prospects or requests for service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Persons selling long distance services (the ``long distance sales force'') may sell cellular services and long
distance services on the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) That the long distance sales force be a distinct group of individuals, with separate managers, from the cellular
sales force and from any sales force that sells products or services of the Bell Operating telephone companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) That the long distance sales force receive any list of the BOC's wireless customers on the same terms, and at the
same time, as that list is received by competing interexchange carriers. The Department anticipates that a BOC cellular
carrier will at regular intervals provide all long distance carriers with listings identifying the names, addresses
and telephone numbers of all cellular subscribers, regardless of the distribution channel through which the subscriber
was retained. It is a condition to the BOCs' direct marketing of cellular long distance that this information be made
available to all competing interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) That the long distance sales force must advise actual or prospective subscribers of their right to presubscribe
to competing interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) That the long distance sales force not receive any information about the identity of the BOC's wireless customers'
interexchange carrier or the wireless customer's cellular or long distance usage, unless the customer is already
a customer of the BOC's interexchange service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) That the long distance sales force be a distinct group of individuals, with separate managers, from any sales force
that sells the products or services of any Bell Operating telephone company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Department understands that the marketing restrictions applicable to ``existing customers'' (as specified
in your letter of November 12, 1993) apply not only to customers existing as of the date of any Order, but also to persons
who become customers of the BOC wireless service thereafter. When such persons become customers, marketing of long
distance service to such persons are subject to the provisions on ``marketing restrictions: new customers''; after
such persons become customers, they are subject to the provisions on ``marketing restrictions: existing customers.''
The Department conditions its support of this waiver on this understanding, and on the further condition that the
BOC personnel marketing long distance services not receive wireless customer names, addresses and telephone numbers
until that information is also available to competing interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Department conditions its support for a waiver on the requirement that, if the BOC or its wireless affiliate
bills its long distance customers for that service in the same billing as for its wireless exchange service, it makes
that billing arrangement available to competing interexchange carriers on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.
It is the Department's understanding that most BOCs currently make such billing arrangements available to interexchange
carriers; if this relief is granted, the Department believes that the BOCs should not be permitted to terminate those
arrangements for competing carriers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The Department opposes any authority pursuant to which the BOC might discriminate in the provision of interexchange
routing or in the colocation of interexchange points of presence in cellular MTSOs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Department believes that the BOCs should be required to notify competing interexchange providers of changes
to existing network services or the addition of new services that affect the interexchange carriers' interconnection
at least 60 days prior to implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Department does not understand the Proposed Order to permit a BOC to treat its long distance service as the default
carrier for a customer that fails to make the required selection of an interexchange carrier. The Department understands
that customers who fail to select an interexchange carrier will not receive interexchange service from their wireless
telephones, and conditions its support for the waiver on that understanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we believe that in this instance it is appropriate to condition the continued provision of interexchange
service on compliance with the equal access conditions and requirements of this waiver and of the MFJ. We also believe
that the waiver order should grant the Court the authority to impose civil fines, not to exceed $10 million, for violations
of equal access conditions and requirements of this waiver or of the MFJ in the provision of interexchange services
from wireless exchanges.

a. That the ``IS&hyph;41 or comparable'' functions specified in paragraph II(a) not be used to discriminate in favor
of the BOC's own interexchange service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

initiated by roaming customers.

III. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Calling Areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that this issue should not be presented to the Court at this time and, if presented, intends
in the absence of further developments to urge the Court to defer ruling on this issue. On June 9, 1994, the Federal Communications
Commission announced the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Notice of Inquiry, pursuant to which the
Commission indicated that it has tentatively concluded that imposing equal access obligations on cellular telephone
companies would be in the public interest. The text of the Notice is not yet available to the public or to the Department.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department understands that any such equal access obligation necessarily requires the adoption of a map defining
local calling areas and delimiting the respective areas of local and long distance service. Therefore, if the Commission
acts in accord with its tentative decision, it will need to consider the appropriate local calling areas for cellular
service, the issue raised by this portion of the BOCs' proposal. The FCC's conclusions may result in the imposition
by regulation of a local calling area map that is different from either (1) the current cellular calling areas, as defined
by the MFJ and subsequent orders, and (2) the relief the BOCs seek here. Given the possibility of inconsistent results,
it would not be productive for the Court to consider a comprehensive redefinition of local calling areas at the same
time that the FCC is considering the same issue. If the FCC does not adopt a final rule on cellular equal access, the Court
may then consider whether it wants to make substantial changes to the cellular equal access map. The Department will,
during the pendency of the FCC proceeding, evaluate pending calling area waiver requests to determine whether they
meet the standards for such relief.

IV. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
FCC Preemption. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not support the relief sought in Section IV of the Proposed Order. If the FCC adopts an equal access
order that reasonably achieves the purposes of the Decree, including equal access, but differs in some technical
respects in its implementation of those purposes, it may be appropriate for the Department and the Court to consider
whether it is necessary or wise to maintain two sets of equal access obligations. However, it would in our view be inappropriate
to make that determination before the Commission adopts a final rule on this subject.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On July 25, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regrading Application for Reconsideration
for former workers of the subject firm. The affirmative notice regarding application was published in the Federal
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41795).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The workers produced coal which was used to make coke for steelmaking operations. Worker separations occurred in
1993 and 1994. The mine closed in March 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On reconsideration the Department contacted Sunnyside's major customer of coal. The customer reported using Sunnyside's
coal to make coke. This process involves baking the coal, not burning or consuming it as fuel. The baking process releases
all the volatiles, leaving a residue called coke which is used in steelmaking operations. New findings on reconsideration
show that Sunnyside's major customer increased its imports of coke in the period relative to the petition while ceasing
its purchases of coal from Sunnyside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Departmental regulations at 29 CFR 90.2 state that an imported article is like or directly competitive with a domestic
article at an earlier or later stage of production and a domestic article is like or directly competitive with an imported
article at an earlier or later stage of production, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on the producers
of the domestic article comparable to the effect of importing the article in the same stage of production as the domestic
article. Accordingly, imported coke is directly competitive with domestically-produced coal in that coking is
a later stage in the processing of coal.

After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the former workers
of the Sunnyside Coal Company in Sunnyside, Utah were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or
directly competitive with coal produced at the Sunnyside Coal Company in Sunnyside, Utah.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 267a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates and
fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Ave. NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Endowment for the Arts is requesting proposals leading to the award of a Cooperative Agreement to assist
in planning, organizing, and implementing the activities of the Mayors' Institute on City Design. The Mayor's Institute
is a series of forums dedicated to the improvement of the design of American cities. The Institute's activities include
two semi-annual two and one half day conferences (institutes), publication of a semi-annual newsletter, alumni
programs at two to four national mayors' conferences, coordination of the activities of four regional institutes,
and maintenance of institute accounts and archives. The national office of the Mayors' Institute on City Design which
will be supported by the Cooperative Agreement will direct these activities, while the national institutes themselves
may take place at other suitable locations as determined by the Endowment and the successful recipient of the Cooperative
Agreement. The initial period of the Cooperative Agreement will be one year with potential renewal for an additional
two years. Funding is limited to $200,000 for the first year. Those interested in receiving the Solicitation package
should reference Program Solicitation PS 94&hyph;14 in their written request. Requests must be accompanied by two
(2) self-addressed labels. Verbal requests for the Solicitations will not be honored.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Co. Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed no Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;57 issued to the Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit
1, located in Appling County, Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would make a one-time change to Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.C for Hatch Unit 1 regarding
the emergency diesel generator (DG) operability requirements during reactor shutdown conditions. Current TS 3.9.C
requires two DGs be operable during reactor shutdown when a core or containment cooling system is required to be operable.
The proposed amendment would revise the current requirement such that only one emergency DG is required to be aligned
to its associated core or containment cooling system during a specific time of the outage. During this time period
the decay heat removal (DHR) system will be in service. The DHR system, which is completely independent of the existing
shutdown cooling system, is powered by the Baxley substation and has it own DG as a backup power supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is requesting this one-time change for the fall 1994 Unit 1 refueling/maintenance outage to perform
local rate testing on the residual heat removal system loops and maintenance on DG 1A. Other limitations are: (1) the
other DG will be aligned to its corresponding core or containment cooling system, (2) the reactor cavity is flooded,
and (3) the fuel pool gates are removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because it does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed change slightly increases the probability of a loss of RHR [Residual Heat Removal] shutdown
cooling, the probability of the total loss of decay heat removal for the core is not increased. Upon an LOSP [Loss-of-Offsite
Power], coupled with the failure of one DG, RHR shutdown cooling (with two RHR pumps and their respective DGs available)
will still be available. One diesel out of service, as will be the case on outage days 5 and 6, an LOSP, coupled with a diesel
failure, will render RHR shutdown cooling unavailable. However, on outage days 5 and 6, the DHR system is also affected
by the LOSP, its backup diesel can be manually placed into service. Furthermore, the RHR shutdown cooling system is
susceptible to a single failure on loss of suction path (inadvertent closure of either value E11&hyph;F008 or F009
even without an LOSP).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
However, on outage days 5 and 6, the RHR and DHR systems will be available for decay heat removal; thus, the unit will
not be susceptible to either single failure with respect to core decay heat removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal does not involve any changes to the secondary containment, secondary containment ventilation systems,
the standby gas treatment system or any other radiological release control systems. Therefore, the consequences
of a loss of decay heat removal event are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This evolution is being performed in the refueling mode of operation, outside the realm of FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report] assumed accidents, except for a refueling accident. Since this proposal does not involve changes to any fuel
handling mechanisms, the probability of a refueling accident is not increased. Furthermore, this proposal does
not involve any changes to the operation or maintenance of any safety-related component designed to prevent or mitigate
the consequences of previously analyzed events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on this discussion, the proposed Technical Specifications change does not increase the probability
or consequences of any previously analyzed accident or transient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different event from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not introduce any new modes of operation. All affected system; i.e., the RHR systems, DGs,
and the DHR system, will be operated within their design specifications. Although the nonsafety-related DHR is a
relatively new system, it was installed, successfully tested, and used for decay heat removal during the Spring 1994
Unit 2 outage. Therefore, no failure modes that have not been previously considered are introduced by this proposed
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Significantly reduce the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed decay heat removal configuration, which will be in use during outage days 5 and 6, uses the DHR system as
the primary decay heat removal mechanism, with RHR loop A as a backup. Although the DHR system is not designed as a safety-related
system, it is conservatively designed with sufficient heat removal capacity and redundancy to provide full heat
removal capacity in a variety of conditions. In fact, testing during the Unit 2 Spring 1994 outage showed that even
early in the outage (approximately day 3) the DHR system is fully capable of handling the decay heat load of the reactor
and the spent fuel pool. Additionally, even though the DHR system takes a suction from, and discharges to, the spent
fuel pool, adequate natural circulation is firmly established between the pool and the reactor vessel such that adequate
decay heat removal is taking place for both the pool and the reactor. This was demonstrated via special test performed
during the Spring Unit 2 refueling outage. In addition, duplicates of major components are provided so that loss of
any one component does not result in loss of system function. Therefore, as far as decay heat removal capability is
concerned, the margin of safety is not reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously, if an LOSP occurs, failure of DG 1C will result in a total loss of RHR shutdown cooling capacity,
since RHR loop 1B will be out of service for LLRT. However, a loss of decay heat removal will not occur, since the DHR system
is in service and is supplied power for the Baxley, Georgia, substation. However, if the Baxley power supply should
fail, the DHR system has its own backup diesel that can be placed in service manually within 4-hour period. Therefore,
the margin of safety associated with an LOSP is not reduced as a result of this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the configuration of decay heat removal systems on days 5 and 6 in is compliance with the existing Unit
2 Specifications, which only require one RHR pump and one DG in Condition 5 (Specifications 3.9.12 and 3.8.1.2, respectively).
Thus, the margin of safety, with respect to the exiting Unit 2 Specifications, is not reduced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the
need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 26, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Appling County Public Library, 301 City Hall
Drive, Baxley, Georgia 31513. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,
a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or
fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the
contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references
to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely
to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within
the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner
to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least
one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to trade options on the Amex/Oscar Gruss Israel Index (``Israeli Index'' or ``Index''), a new stock
index developed by the Amex in conjunction with Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, Inc. based on Israeli stocks (or ADRs thereon)
trades on the Amex, New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or that are National Market (``NM'') securities traded through
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission.

In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex has developed a new index called The Amex/Oscar Gruss Israel Index, based entirely on shares of widely held
Israeli stocks and American Depository Receipts (``ADRs'') traded on the NYSE, or that are NM securities. The Index
contains securities of highly capitalized companies with major business interests in Israel. These include companies
which are incorporated in Israel, whose offices are located in Israel, or whose research and development activities
are concentrated in Israel.

Index Calculation and Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is calculated using a ``modified'' equal dollar weighting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 methodology. Five of the eleven component securities have been given a higher weighting in the Index in order to more
closely approximate the weight the industry represented by that component has in the Israeli stock market. For example,
ECI Telecom Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which are the largest capitalized components in the Index,
will have a higher weight in the Index, but not as high as if the Index were capitalization weighted. The Amex believes
that this ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology allows the Index to be a more accurate reflection of the
Israeli market since it provides a higher weighting for the larger capitalized components, yet does not permit those
stocks not dominate the Index. The Exchange believes that this method of calculation is important given the great
disparity in market value of a few of the Index's components. It has been the Exchange's experience that options on
market value weighted indexes dominated by one or two components are less useful to investors, since the index will
tend to represent the one or two components and not the group as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a description of how the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting calculation method works. As of the
market close on June 17, 1994, a $100,000 portfolio comprised of eleven Israeli component securities was established
representing a hypothetical ``investment'' (rounded to the nearest whole share) of $12,000 in the five largest capitalized
Index components and $6,667 in each of the six remaining Index Components. The value of the Index equals the current
market value (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the Index components divided
by the Index divisor. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield the benchmark value of 213.00 at the close
of trading on June 17, 1994. Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of March, June,
September and December, the Index components will be ranked in descending market capitalization order and the Index
portfolio adjusted by changing the number of whole shares of each component stock so that the five largest capitalized
stocks in the Index represent 60% of the Index value, and the remaining 40% of the Index value is evenly distributed
over the remaining securities. If the number of components in the Index changes from eleven securities, the Amex will
continue to weight the five components with the highest market capitalization 12%. The remaining components will
then be weighted equally.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if two new components are added to the Index, the five securities with the highest market capitalizations
will be assigned 12% weightings while the remaining eight securities in the Index would be weighted 5%.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows
an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining
the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing
to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on
the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex states that it has had experience making regular quarterly adjustments to a number of its indexes and has not
encountered investor confusion regarding the adjustments, since they are done on a regular basis and timely, proper
and adequate notice is given. An information circular is distributed to all Exchange members notifying them of the
quarterly changes. This circular is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms,
mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers
of the Options News Network. In addition, the Exchange will include in its promotional and marketing materials for
the Index a description of the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. As noted above, the number of shares
of each component stock in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly reviews except in the event of certain
types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary cash dividend, a stock distribution,
stock splits, reverse stock splits, a rights offering distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar
event with respect to the component stocks. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer of a component stock, if the stock
remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share,
to maintain the components' relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. In
the event of a stock replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining portfolio components in the same weighting
tier as the stock being replaced will be calculated and that amount ``invested'' in the stock of the new component,
to the nearest whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure Index continuity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to
time substitute stocks, or adjust the number of stocks included in the Index, based on changing conditions in Israel.
However, the Exchange will not decrease the number of Index component stocks to less than nine or increase the number
of component stocks to greater than fourteen without prior Commission approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the Index will be calculated continuously and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape
Association's Network B.

The Exchange proposes to trade cash-settled, European-style Index options (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, exercises are permitted at expiration only). The Exchange also proposes that Israeli Index options will have trading
hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. EST. As with other index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will expire
on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day
in an option series will normally be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday
of the expiration month (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the
last trading day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Israeli Index option will be calculated based upon the primary
exchange regular way opening sale prices for the component securities.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of NM securities, the first reported sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component
securities, its opening sale price is used in the calculation. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value
of the Index is determined and that value is used as the settlement value of the option. If any of the component stocks
do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price is used in the
calculation.

The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional
calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration
may be trade. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term,
reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval
between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index's component securities all have major business interests in Israel, and have been selected on the basis
of their market capitalization, trading liquidity, and representation of Israeli business industries. The Amex
believes the components represent the largest and most liquid of all Israeli securities trading in the U.S., and that
the Index tracks closely the performance of larger broad market Israeli indexes, such as the Oscar Gruss Israel Index,
which contains all of the more than 50 Israeli securities currently traded in the U.S. This index is carried in the Israeli
press as well as by Bloomberg L.P., a major U.S. data vendor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In choosing among Israeli stocks that meet the minimum criteria set forth in Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will
select stocks that: (1) have a minimum market value in U.S. dollars of at least $75 million, except that for each of the
lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of
the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly trading volume in the U.S. markets
over the previous six month period of not less than 500,000 shares (or ADRs); (3) have at least 85% of the numerical Index
value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting the current criteria for standardized option
trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject
to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex will ensure that no more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities
that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, no Index components have the majority of their trading volume occurring on an exchange with which the Amex
does not currently have in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement.

Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These
Rules cover issues such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently
used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options
on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under
Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market.

The Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Exchange believes the ability to use Auto-Ex
for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with liquid markets and expeditious executions. The Amex represents
that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction of Israeli
Index Options.

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to ensure that all broker-dealers assigned to the Exchange as their Designated
Examining Authority (``DEA'') provide the Exchange with reports of all outside assets and liabilities attributable
to the broker-dealer. This will enable the Exchange to independently review and confirm the capital computations
and consolidated financial condition of Exchange DEA assigned broker-dealers, thereby enhancing its oversight
responsibilities in conjunction with the Commission's more stringent reporting requirements under the Net Capital
Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in that the rule is designed to prevent
fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect
to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriated and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

Relating to Equity and SPX RAES Participation Requirements</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposal to amend its rules to impose fees on market makers who fail to observe certain participation duties on the
Retail Automated Execution System (``RAES'') for equity and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (``SPX'') classes of
options. Among other things, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 8.16, ``RAES Eligibility in Equity Options'' and
24.16, ``RAES Eligibility in SPX/NDX,'' to impose the following fees for failures to satisfy the rules' log-off requirements:
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 (1) a fee of $100.00 for each of one to three failures within one twelve-month period; (2) a fee of $250.00 for each of
four to six failures within one twelve-month period; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for each of seven or more failures within
one twelve-month period. In addition, the proposal provides that members who fail to meet the log-on requirements
of CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b) ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading
station for a period extending to 21 consecutive business days.

CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii) require a market maker participating in RAES for equity or SPX options
to continue on the system only as long as he is present in the trading crowd and to log off RAES when he leaves the trading
crowd, unless the departure is for a brief interval.

CBOE Rule 8.16(b) states that in option classes designated by the Market Performance Committee (``MPC''), any market
maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in that option class whenever
he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration. CBOE Rule 24.16(b) states that unless exempted by the
MPC, any market maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in SPX/NDX
whenever he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration.

FR 35954 (July 14, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to impose fees on members who fail to observe the RAES
log-off requirements set forth in CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a). The proposed fees for equity and SPX RAES are identical
in amounts and graduated structure to the fees approved recently for failures to comply with the log-on and log-off
requirements for Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 For OEX options, and as proposed for SPX and equity options, the fee amounts increase in relation to the number of times
each calendar year that a member does not log off as required.

As is the case for fees applicable to OEX RAES participants under existing CBOE Rule 24. 17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,''
the proposed fees do not constitute disciplinary action, although the CBOE's review procedures in Chapter XIX, ``Hearings
and Review,'' of the CBOE's rules will be available for review of fees assessed under the proposal. The CBOE states
that the Commission has noted the appropriateness of such fees and appeal rights in a related context.

Specifically, in approving a CBOE proposal that included procedures for contesting the fees assessed for delayed
submission of trade data, the Commission stated that ``Although such formalized procedures are unusual for challenging
fee assessments, they actually make the imposition of the fee fairer by allowing members to challenge erroneous fee
charges. Moreover, these procedures are reasonably designed to afford a member assessed a fee the opportunity to
challenge the veracity of the assessments.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to establishing a fee schedule for failures to comply with log-on and log-off requirements, the CBOE proposes
to issue a Regulatory Circular that will reaffirm the nature of CBOE market makers' RAES log-on and log-off responsibilities
in equity and SPX options classes and describe the consequences that attach to any market maker's failure to observe
these responsibilities. The Regulatory Circular addresses four points. First, CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii)
require any market maker who has logged onto RAES at a trading station on any given trading day to log off RAES whenever
the market maker leaves the trading crowd for more than ``a brief interval.'' The Regulatory Circular interprets
``a brief interval'' to mean ``five consecutive minutes.'' Under this interpretation any market maker who signs
onto RAES at a particular trading station during a trading session must log off the system prior to leaving that station
for more than five consecutive minutes. The CBOE believes that this interpretation should eliminate ambiguity about
the amount of time a market maker may be away from the trading crowd without signing off RAES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Regulatory Circular notes that graduated fees will be assessed under CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a)
for failures to observe the RAES log-off requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Regulatory Circular reflects the MPC's designation pursuant to CBOE Rules 8.16(b) and 24.16(b) that the
expiration month log-on requirements reflected in those rules will be enforced in all classes of equity and SPX options
for which RAES is available. Accordingly, any market maker who has logged onto RAES in accordance with CBOE Rules 8.16(a)
or 24.16(a) during an expiration month for a given class of options must log on whenever present at the applicable trading
station, until the next expiration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the Regulatory Circular reflects a determination by the MPC, pursuant to its authority under CBOE Rules 8.16(d)
and 24.16(d), that any market maker who fails to meet the log-on requirements under CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b)
ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading station for a period extending
to 21 consecutive business days.

In contrast to this suspension provision, the OEX RAES Approval Order provides that members who fail to observe the
RAES log-on requirements for OEX options are subject to a fee. The CBOE has determined that suspensions, not fees,
are the appropriate mechanisms to promote compliance with RAES log-on requirements for equity and SPX options. The
CBOE states that it may introduce fees for failures to observe the log-on requirements for equity and SPX options at
a later date if experience so dictates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to enable the CBOE to enforce compliance with
the Act, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest by assuring
that equity and SPX options market makers are aware of and meet their responsibilities pertaining to RAES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the graduated fee schedule for failures to comply with the RAES log-off requirements
and the imposition of suspensions for failures to meet the RAES log-on requirements established in CBOE Rules 8.16(b)
and 24.16(b) are designed to maintain the integrity of the RAES system for equity and SPX options. The fees and suspensions,
together with the provision specifying that a market maker must log off RAES when leaving the trading crowd for more
than ``a brief interval'' of five minutes, are designed to ensure that there is adequate market maker participation
at all times in SPX and equity RAES and that market makers are properly logged on to the system. The presence of an adequate
number of market makers protects investors and contributes to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by helping
the Exchange to maintain the continued availability of RAES for SPX and equity options, thereby contributing to the
effective and efficient execution of public investor orders at the best available prices.

In addition, the Commission believes that the proposed Regulatory Circular should facilitate compliance with SPX
and equity RAES requirements by explaining market makers' RAES log-on and log-off requirements and the fees and suspensions
provided for failures to satisfy those requirements. The Commission also believes that the graduated fee schedule
should encourage compliance with the log-off requirements and may increase the Exchange's ability to deter repeat
offenders. Likewise, the Commission believes that the provision establishing suspensions for failures to comply
with the RAES log-on requirements should deter participating market makers from abandoning their commitment to
RAES for other than good cause.

The Commission notes that under CBOE Rules 8.16 and 34.16 the CBOE retains the discretion to bring full disciplinary
proceedings. The Commission expects the CBOE to bring full disciplinary proceedings where appropriate, for example,
in cases of egregious or repeated violations of the SPX and equity RAES requirements.

Finally, the Commission believes, as it has concluded in the past,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 that the right to appeal the fees and suspensions imposed under the proposal pursuant to Chapter XIX of the CBOE's rules
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 should help to safeguard the procedural rights to SPX and equity RAES participants. In addition, the Commission believes
that the CBOE's Regulatory Circular should help to safeguard the procedural rights of SPX and equity RAES participants
by providing them with additional notification and clarification of their RAES log-on and log-off responsibilities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled European-style
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 index options on the Emerging Markets Index. The Index will initially consist of 25 closed-end funds which invest
in the stocks of firms in the emerging Asian and Latin American economies. According to the Exchange, no proxy for the
performance of these emerging economies is currently available in the U.S. derivatives markets. The Exchange believes,
therefore, that options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance
of these markets and/or hedging against the risk of investing in the Asian and Latin American emerging markets.

The components of the Index are the: Asia Pacific Fund; Asia Tigers Fund Inc.; China Fund Inc.; Greater China Fund Inc.;
Jardine Fleming China Region Fund Inc.; Morgan Stanley India Fund; Indonesia Fund Inc.; Jakarta Growth Fund Inc.;
Korea Fund Inc.; Korea Equity Fund Inc.; Malaysia Fund Inc.; First Philippine Fund Inc.; Singapore Fund Inc.; ROC

As of June 15, 1994, the closed-end funds comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $49.4 million
to a high of $1.146 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $146 million. The closed-end fund accounting
for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was the Chile Fund Inc. (9.07%), while the
smallest was the Korea Equity Fund Inc. (1.98%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the components relative to the base date of December
31, 1991. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor
that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The value of the Index at the close on June 15, 1994, was 151.69.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component closed-end fund is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the closed-end fund traded will be used in the Index calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
certain rights issuances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the emerging Asian and Latin American markets generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a component
from the Index, every effort will be made to add a closed-end fund that preserves the character of the Index. In such
circumstances, the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition
of the proposed replacement closed-end fund. The Exchange will most likely maintain 25 closed-end funds in the Index
at all times.

Long-Term Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10) of the value of the Index. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value
Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced
value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.

Exercise and Settlement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of
the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Emerging Markets Index options. The Exchange states
that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus,
the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the
expiration date.

Exchange Rules Applicable
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's Rules regarding narrow-based indexes
will be applicable to Index options.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to Exchange Rule 24.4A, Index option contracts based on the Emerging Markets Index will be subject to the
position limits of 10,500 contracts.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of position and exercise limits, Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis.
Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAP
for purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support
new options series that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS.

the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 in particular, in that it will provide investors with an opportunity to invest in options based upon the Emerging Markets
Index pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable
principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination with persons facilitating transactions in securities,
remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and the public interest.

In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposes to treat the CBOE Emerging Asian Markets Index as a narrow-based index for
purposes of margin and position limit treatment. Pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.4A, the position limits for the CBOE Emerging
Asian Markets Index would initially be set at 10,500 contracts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 index options on the Emerging Asian Markets Index. The Index will initially consist of 16 closed-end funds which invest
in the stocks of firms in the emerging Asian economies. According to the Exchange, no proxy for the performance of these
emerging economies is currently available in the U.S. derivatives markets. The Exchange believes, therefore, that
options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance of these markets
and/or hedging against the risk of investing in the Asian emerging markets.

The Emerging Asian Markets Index will initially consist of 16 closed-end funds.

 All of the closed-end fund components of the Index currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

The components of the Index are the: Asia Pacific Fund; Asia Tigers Fund Inc.; China Fund Inc.; Greater China Fund Inc.;
Jardine Fleming China Region Fund Inc.; Morgan Stanley India Fund; Indonesia Fund Inc.; Jarkarta Growth Fund Inc.;
Korea Fund Inc.; Korea Equity Fund Inc.; Malaysia Fund Inc.; First Philippine Fund Inc.; Singapore Fund Inc.; ROC

As of June 15, 1994, the closed-end funds comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $49.4 million
to a high of $589.4 million. The average capitalization as of that date was $214.5 million. The closed-end fund accounting
for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was the Thai Fund Inc. (10.60%), while the
smallest was the Jakarta Growth Fund Inc. (3.52%).

Calculation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the components relative to the base date of December
31, 1991. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor
that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The value of the Index at the close on June 15, 1994, was 155.07.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component closed-end fund is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the closed-end fund traded will be used in the Index calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
certain rights issuances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the emerging Asian markets generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a component from the Index,
every effort will be made to add a closed-end fund that preserves the character of the Index. In such circumstances,
the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed
replacement closed-end fund. The Exchange will most likely maintain 16 closed-end funds in the Index at all times.

Long-Term Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS of which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
th
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the value of the Index. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value Index LEAPS will, after such
initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced value, all other specifications
and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.

Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of
the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Emerging Asian Markets Index options. The Exchange states
that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus,
the last day for trading in a expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the
expiration date.

Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's Rules regarding narrow-based index
will be applicable to Index options.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to Exchange rule 24.4A, Index option contracts based on the Emerging Asian Markets Index will be subject
to position limits of 10,500 contracts.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of position and exercise limits, Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis.
Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAP contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAP for
purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support
new options series that would result from the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS.

the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 in particular, in that it will provide investors with an opportunity to invest in options based upon the Emerging Asian
Markets Index pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just
and equitable principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination with persons facilitating transactions
in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and

No. 34379 (July 14, 1994), 59 FR 37110 (July 20, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves
the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHX's Board of Governors (``Board'') is responsible for managing the business of the Exchange and is vested with
all the powers necessary for the government of the Exchange, the regulation of the business conduct of members and
member organizations and the promotion of the welfare, objects and purposes of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, the Board consists of twenty-four elected Governors, plus the Vice Chairman of the Board and the President
of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Of the twenty-four Governors, sixteen must be members, general partners of member firms or officers of member corporations
(``member Governors''); and eight must be unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker-dealer in securities (``non-member
Governors'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The CHX Constitution also requires that nine of the sixteen member Governors be from the Chicago area, at least three
of whom must be active on the floor of the Exchange, and that seven member Governors be from outside the Chicago area.

In terms of their qualifications, participant Governors must have securities clearance and/or settlement expertise,

According to the CHX, the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1), 6(b)(3) and 6(b)(5) of
the Act. Section 6(b)(1) of the Act requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes
of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members, with the
Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the
rules of an exchange assure the fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration
of its affairs and provide that one or more directors represent issuers and investors and not be associated with a member
of the exchange or a broker-dealer. Finally, Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rules
of an exchange be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

After careful review, the Commission believes that the CHX proposal should allow the Exchange and its subsidiaries
to operate more efficiently. In addition, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change strikes an appropriate
balance between the various constituencies of the CHX

 and, therefore, is consistent with the Act's requirements. The Commission's reasons for reaching these conclusions
are set forth in more detail below.

The Commission recognizes that the CHX and its clearing corporation and trust company subsidiaries generally are
viewed as parts of one ``Exchange complex.'' Among other things, the CHX, MCC and MSTC share certain facilities, systems
and financial services.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Under the current governance structure, however, the CHX has found that having different Governors serve on the Board
of each organization can complicate strategic planning for the ``complex'' and may create certain inefficiencies
in the development and implementation of policy.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 In order to address these issues, the proposed rule change will enable the same individuals to serve on the Board of
the CHX and its subsidiaries.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission therefore believes that the CHX proposal should foster greater coordination in decision making among
the Exchange, MCC and MSTC.

More importantly for purposes of the Act's requirements, the Commission finds that the new Board will continue to
be representative of the CHX and its various constituencies.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission has concluded that, as a practical matter, the proposed rule change should maintain
existing levels of public participation on the CHX Board and should prevent floor domination of the governance of
the Exchange.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, although the Commission would be concerned by a significant increase in the proportion of securities professionals
on an exchange's board, the Commission does not believe that the CHX proposal favors professionals at the expense
of the public. The Commission notes that the CHX Board presently consists of sixteen member (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, industry) Governors and eight non-members (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, public) Governors. As amended, four participant Governors and one non-member Governor will be added to the Board,
for a total of twenty industry and nine public representatives. On that basis, the Commission agrees with the Exchange's
argument that the proposed rule change will, in effect, maintain the current balance between those constituencies.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission therefore finds that the CHX proposal is consistent with the fair representation and the protection
of investors and the public interest.

Under the proposed reorganization, public Governors will constitute 31% of the CHX Board, as opposed to 33% of the
existing Board, which is a minor change.

Similarly, based on certain commitments made by the CHX, the Commission is satisfied that the proposed rule change
will not be used as an indirect means to achieve floor domination of the Board. The Commission recognizes that many
MCC or MSTC participants are also CHX members and, in that capacity, may be active on the floor of the Exchange. Due to
the Commission's long-standing concerns, Exchange management has committed to use its best efforts to ensure that
the participant Governor positions will not be filled by floor members upon implementation of the proposed rule change
or in the future.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that these commitments should be sufficient to prevent floor members' interests from being
over-represented in the governance of the Exchange. Finally, although the proposal will allow Governors to be recategorized,
the Commission expects the CHX to exercise its discretion in a manner which is consistent with the above commitments.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 On the conditions set forth above, the Commission is satisfied that the Board composition should be sufficiently
diverse for it to carry out its obligations under the Act.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1, prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof. The CHX proposal is designed to achieve a more coherent
governance structure while maintaining fair representation of Exchange constituencies and protecting investors
and the public interest. Accelerated approval thereof will allow these benefits to be realized as soon as possible.
In addition, the proposed rule change was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the full statutory period and no comments were received on any aspect of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,

 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;15), including Amendment No. 1, is approved on an accelerated

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change by Cincinnati Stock Exchange,
Inc. Relating to the Exchange's Quality of Markets Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 1, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and
III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The percentage of a non-preferencing member firm's total monthly CSE trade activity which consists of ITS inbound
executions shall equal or exceed the average percentage achieved by preferencing Designated Dealers that manually
enter quotations. If there exist no preferencing Dealers on CSE that are manually entering quotations, then the percentage
of a non-preferencing member firm's total monthly CSE trade activity which consists of ITS inbound executions shall
equal at least 5%. For the purpose of comparing ITS inbound activity, a rolling three-month average will be used to
derive the percentage for the DDs entering manual quotations and these will be compared to the next month's percentages
achieved by those member firms using computer-generated quotations.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On February 25, 1994, the CSE filed proposed changes to its quality of markets policy.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal calls for the elimination of autoquoting and the adoption of objective standards to ensure that CSE specialists
are contributing to the national market system. In response to comments on the filing, the Exchange proposes to amend
one component of its new policy, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') inbound execution requirement. Specifically,
the requirement, as amended, would require that all Designated Dealers who computer-generate their quotations,
whether or not they preference order flow, generate the same percentage of ITS inbound activity as preferencing Designated
Dealers who manually generate quotes. The Exchange believes that such an approach would more fairly allocate the
burden of improved performance across all of its specialists.

II. Description of the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The present proposal amends the NASD's PORTAL Rules to add a security application fee that would be charged to PORTAL
participants who apply to the NASD so that, when appropriate, a security may be designated in The PORTAL Market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., operates The PORTAL Market for the quotation of securities that are restricted securities,
as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or are securities that are treated
as if restricted.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In order to qualify for inclusion in The PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must
be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification
number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class. Designation of a security as a PORTAL security permits
the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and be cleared and settled through
the Depository Trust Company.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Part II, PORTAL Rules, provides that to qualify for initial designation and continued designation in the PORTAL Market,
a security shall be either a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, or a security
that upon issuance and continually thereafter only can be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act,
Rule 144A, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 and not involving any public offering.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision requires that the security meet the ``fungibility'' and ``information delivery requirements''
of Rule 144A(d) (3) and (4) under the Securities Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 2 of the PORTAL Rules, any PORTAL participant may submit an application for security designation.
``PORTAL participants'' include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories
of PORTAL participants are required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the
Exchange Act and members of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that
are not members of the NASD that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PORTAL Market has processed over one thousand applications for designation as a PORTAL security. The NASD has
operated The PORTAL Market since its initiation June 1990 without the imposition of any fees on users. Under the present
proposal, the NASD will adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each security
identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. The fee for each security identification symbol is being
established because many private offerings involve securities that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which
is treated as a separate security that is assigned a separate identification symbol, even though they are part of a
single private offering.

The NASD believes the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing
costs associated with the operation of The PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing
of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review
of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that
the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of The PORTAL Rules, as discussed above. Given the efforts required
by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD believes that the fees as proposed are appropriate.

III. Commission's Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the
Exchange Act,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates
or controls. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications
submitted by PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in
The PORTAL Market. The Commission believes the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee is reasonable in that it should assist
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., in covering continuing costs associated with the operation of The PORTAL Market, including
significant costs associated with the processing of security applications for the The PORTAL Market.

On March 15, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>

The rule change substitutes the word ``subsidiary'' for the term ``affiliate'' in Commentaries .10 through .25 in
Rule 321.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34301 (July 1, 1994),59
FR 35162 (July 8, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, NYSE Rule 321 requires a member or member organization to obtain Exchange approval for the formation or
acquisition of an affiliated company. The term ``affiliate'' is defined in NYSE Rule 321.10 as ``an entity engaged
in a securities, or kindred business that is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
controlled by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member or member organization'' (emphasis added). The Exchange is amending NYSE Rule 321, as well as Rules 113 and
122 (that refer to an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 321), by substituting the term ``subsidiary'' for the term
``affiliate.'' The Exchange believes that this non-substantive change will minimize confusion and avoid potential
problems which could arise as a result of differing definitions of the term ``affiliate'' and clarify that the Rules
do not apply to parent or sister companies.

For example, the Act defines an ``affiliate'' as ``a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
controls 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified'' (emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Exchange is amending the definition of ``control'' for purposes of NYSE Rule 321.10. Currently,
control is presumed if a member or member organization owns 25% or more of the voting securities of an entity or is entitled
to receive 25% or more of the net profits. Under NYSE Rule 2, however, control would also be presumed if an associated
person is a director, general partner or principal executive officer or another entity.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange believes it is appropriate to include general partner status in the presumption of control for purposes
of Rule 321.10.

Under NYSE Rule 2, a person is presumed to control another person if such person directly or indirectly; (1) has the
right to vote 25 percent or more of the voting securities, (2) is entitled to receive 25 percent or more of the net profits,
or (3) is a director, general partner or principal executive officer (or persons occupying a similar status or performing
similar functions) of the other person.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the Commission believes substituting the term ``subsidiary'' for the term ``affiliate'' is a non-substantive
change that will clarify to members which formations or acquisitions require prior Exchange approval under NYSE
Rule 321. In addition, the Commission believes that including general partner status in the presumption of control
for purposes of NYSE Rule 321 is consistent with other Exchange Rules and will facilitate Exchange oversight of functionally
equivalent transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 9, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Section 9&hyph;1, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund_How Appointed'' of Article IX, ``Trustees of Stock
Exchange Fund'' of the Exchange's By-Laws requires that the trustees of the Stock Exchange Fund (``Fund'') include
the Chairman of the Exchange's Board of Governors, two Vice Chairmen of the Board of Governors and up to five other Exchange
members, all of whom are appointed by the Exchange's Board of Governors and serve for three years or until a successor
is appointed. The PHLX proposes to amend Section 9&hyph;1 to allow two members of the Exchange's Board of Governors,
rather than two Vice Chairmen, to serve as trustees of the Fund and to allow qualified non-members to serve as trustees.
In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10&hyph;13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law Article X, ``Standing
Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange serve on the Exchange's
Executive Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX states that the proposal to amend By-Law Article IX, Section 9&hyph;1 will give the Exchange's Board of Governors
more flexibility in choosing trustees of the Fund by eliminating the requirement that all trustees be Exchange members
or affiliated with member organizations. Under the proposal, the Board of Governors will be able to choose qualified
persons with investment management expertise regardless of their status respecting Exchange membership or affiliation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will also eliminate the requirement that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees,
to ease the administrative burdens currently imposed upon the Vice Chairmen. The proposal retains the Board of Governors'
oversight of the trustees by continuing to require the Chairman of the Board of Governors to be a trustee and by imposing
a new requirement that two other members of the Board of Governors be trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to By-Law Article X, Section 10&hyph;13 deletes the Executive Vice President of the PHLX from
membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee. The PHLX states that the Exchange's management will continue
to be represented on the Executive Committee by the Exchange's President and Chief Executive Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section
6(b)(3), in that it is designed to assure a fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration of
its affairs and to provide that one or more Fund trustees may be representatives not associated with a member of the
Exchange.

Open account advances made to CNGF will be made by book entry only, not evidenced by short-term notes, and will bear
the same interest rate as open account advances made to participants in the CNG System Money Pool, a rate equal to the
effective weighted average rate of interest on CNG's commercial paper and/or revolving credit borrowing. All such
advances will be payable on demand and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. Long-term loans to CNGF
will be evidenced by long-term non-negotiable notes (which may be book entry) of CNGF maturing over a period of time
to be determined by the officers of CNG, with the interest predicated on and substantially equal to CNG's cost of funds
for comparable borrowings by CNG. In the event that CNG has not had recent comparable borrowings, the rates will be

CSWI and CSWdM propose to organize and to invest in a subsidiary company, which will be organized under the laws of the
United Mexican States and is anticipated to be named CSW de Mexico Servicios, S.A. de C.V. (``CSWdM Servicios'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants propose to organize CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios in the following manner: (1) CSWI will be organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized share capital of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share; (2) CSWdM will be organized under the laws of the United Mexican States with an authorized share capital
of up to 10,000 shares of common stock, par value NP$5.00 per share; and (3) CSWdM Servicios will be organized under

per share, and Energy will initially subscribe to one share of CSWdM common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00
per share. CSWI and Energy will thus own all authorized and issued shares of CSWdM. CSWdM will initially subscribe
to 9,999 shares of CSWdM Servicios common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00 per share, and CSWI will initially
subscribe to one share of CSWdM Servicios common stock at a subscription price of NP$5.00 per share. CSWI and CSWdM
will thus own all authorized and issued shares of CSWdM Servicios. Energy will hold directly one share in CSWdM, and
CSWI will hold directly one share in CSWdM Servicios, to comply with the requirement under Mexican law that each of
CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios has a minimum of two shareholders. In the event any company in the CSW System is to acquire

The Applicants assert that the purpose of this structure is to: (1) localize management of domestic and foreign office

CSWI will engage exclusively in Permitted Activities by serving as a holding company for CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and
Project Parents. CSWdM anticipates engaging in Permitted Activities primarily in Mexico. However, CSWdM may also
engage in Permitted Activities in other foreign countries through joint ventures with third parties (``Joint Ventures'').
The nature of the independent power market in Mexico is such that CSWdM's nonaffiliate Mexican entity partner(s)
in a Joint Venture may seek to have such Joint Venture engage in Permitted Activities in a foreign country other than
Mexico. It is, therefore, desirable that CSWdM, in order to attract Joint Venture partners, have the authority, directly
or indirectly, to engage in Permitted Activities in foreign countries other than Mexico.

CSWdM Servicios will provide services to CSWdM and Project Parents that shall conduct Permitted Activities outside
of the United States. Such services shall include management, administrative, employment, tax, accounting, engineering,
consulting, utility performance and electronic data processing services and software development and support
services in connection therewith. CSWdM Servicios will provide localized management of Mexican employees, increased
efficiency from a consolidated foreign office staff and a vehicle to insulate CSW and its affiliates from tax, labor
and other liabilities that may apply under Mexican law. CSWdM Servicios will not provide services to any subsidiary
company or affiliate of CSW other than CSWdM, CSWI, their subsidiary companies or Project Parents that shall conduct
Permitted Activities outside the United States, without prior Commission approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project Parents will engage in E/F Activities and be special purpose domestic corporations, partnerships or limited
liability companies or foreign corporations, partnerships or limited liability companies (or the equivalent thereof),
and will include Joint Venture(s) engaged in E/F Activities. CSW's experience, in connection with its foreign project
development activities to date, including the preparation and submission of bids in connection with foreign government
energy privatization programs, is that the organization, formation or acquisition of one or more Project Parents
is necessary or desirable to facilitate E/F Activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holding structure of one or more Project Parents may be necessary to minimize foreign and domestic tax liabilities
(e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable tax treaties
among foreign countries). Project Parents may be necessary or desirable for bidding on FUCOs or EWGs through Joint
Ventures, since each member of the Joint Venture will typically want to have at least one consolidated subsidiary
in the final FUCO or EWG ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Project Parents would insulate CSW,
CSWI and CSWdM from certain business, tax and labor risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests
among or by the members of such Joint Venture. A Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests
in both FUCOs and EWGs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any such indirect investment by CSW in any Project Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof and after
giving effect thereto, CSW's ``aggregate investment,'' determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all
FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of CSW's ``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule
53(a)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments by CSW, CSWI or CSWdM, directly or indirectly, in any Project Parent may take the form of any combination
of acquisition of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing
under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable. Any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities
of a Project Parent that have a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value. Any investment
in any particular Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection
with making the underlying investment in any FUCO and/or EWG with respect to which such Project Parent was organized,
taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs and cash reserves required to be maintained
in accordance with any financing document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 45 days after CSW, CSWI or CSWdM determines that the purpose for owning any Project Parent no longer exists,
it shall liquidate, dissolve or sell such Project Parent, unless, within that time-period, CSW, CSWI or CSWdM, as
the case may be, determines that such Project Parent may be used in connection with a proposal or plan to develop or acquire
an interest in a different FUCO or EWG. The Applicants request authority to liquidate, dissolve or sell any Project
Parent under such circumstances.

CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios propose to enter into agreements with CSW Services and Energy concerning services

In addition, CSWI, CSWdM and CSWdM Servicios may from time to time require the services of certain employees of the
Central Power and Light, Company, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, Southwestern Electric Power Company and West
Texas Utilities Company (collectively, ``Operating Subsidiaries'') in connection with Permitted Activities.
Certain employees of the Operating Subsidiaries are fluent in languages other than English or knowledgeable in the
operation of Facilities, which may be necessary or desirable skills for CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios to demonstrate
in connection with the Permitted Activities. However, the necessity or desirability of such skills does not economically
justify hiring employees of CSWI, CSWdM and/or CSWdM Servicios with such skills during the commencement of activities
at such companies. Accordingly, the Applicants seek authority for the Operating Subsidiaries to provide such services

by CSW. The accounting by the CSW system of such services will ensure that CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios, as the case
may be, will be obligated to reimburse the appropriate Operating Subsidiary for such services. In no event will the
provision of such services adversely affect the rate base or the costs to ratepayers of any such Operating Subsidiary.

Contributions may be made from CSW to CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Servicios and/or Project Parents directly or indirectly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the amount of all outstanding Guarantees and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments provided by CSW directly or indirectly to CSWI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and/or Project Parents shall not exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Aggregate General Authority. Such Investments would bear interest at a rate per annum based on market rates for
similar credits, but in any event not in excess of CSW's weighted cost of capital and would have a final maturity not
to exceed five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants contend that in order to compete in the marketplace and to develop Facilities, CSWI, CSWdM and each Project
Parent will require the ability to bid on or otherwise pursue multiple projects on a simultaneous basis and to provide
Guarantees at the time of bid or during development. The inability of CSWI, CSWdM and/or the Project Parents to provide
such Guarantees on a timely basis will variously prevent, hinder or make more costly their participation in Facilities
for which it would otherwise be able to secure contracts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms of, and any fees or interest payable in respect of, Guarantees will be established at arm's length in conformity
with market practice; provided that the cost of Guarantees (including interest on outstanding reimbursement obligations
in respect of Guarantees) provided by CSW to or for the benefit of CSWI, CSWdM or any Project Parent will not exceed CSW's
weighted cost of capital; provided further that the fees with respect to any Guarantee would not exceed 2% per annum
of the face amount of such Guarantee, and the interest payable per annum on the unreimbursed drawings under any Guarantee
would not exceed the prime rate of the issuer plus six percentage points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments and, if necessary, the payment of the Guarantees shall be funded through third party financing. CSW,
CSWI, CSWdM and each Project Parent request authority to finance the Investment in Facilities or, if necessary, to
fund the payment of Guarantees through the issuance from time to time of stock, promissory notes, commercial paper
or other debt or equity securities to third parties, including, without limitation, banks, insurance companies
and other financial institutions. The aggregate of such financing will not, when added to the Investments and Guarantees,
exceed the Aggregate General Authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to any third party may include capital shares, partnership interests,
trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable foreign law. Debt securities issued
to third parties may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated notes, bonds or other evidence
of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
The amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including (in the case of any indebtedness) interest
rate, maturity, prepayment or redemption privileges and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect
thereto, would be negotiated in arm's length transactions on a case by case basis, taking into account differences
from project to project in optimum debt-equity ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives
and methods and other similar financial and performance characteristics of each project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CSW states that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued or sold
by a Project Parent for a consideration that is less than such par value. CSW also states that no note, bond or other evidence
of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature later than 30 years from the date of issuance thereof,
and will bear interest at a rate not in excess of the following: (1) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is U.S. dollar
denominated, at a rate not to exceed seven percent over the then applicable prime rate as announced from time to time
by Mellon Bank, N.A. (``Applicable Rate''); and (2) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the
currency of a country other than the United States, at a rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing
rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country would be equivalent to
a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable
Rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that fees in the form of placement or commitment fees, or other similar fees, would be paid to lenders,
placement agents or other third parties in connection with the issuance of any such non-recourse debt securities.
CSW requests authority for any Project Parent to agree to pay placement or commitment fees, and other similar fees,
in connection with any borrowing, provided that the effective annual interest charge on any indebtedness evidencing
such borrowing is not greater than 115% of the stated interest rate thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the issuance of debt securities by any Project Parent, it is anticipated that such Project Parent
may pledge and/or grant a security interest in its assets. Such pledge or security interest may include, without limitation,
the shares or other equity securities of any FUCO, EWG or Project Parent that it owns, including, without limitation,
a security interest in any distributions from any such FUCO, EWG or Project Parent, or a collateral assignment of its
rights under and interests in its other property, including, without limitation, any rights under any power purchase
agreement, fuel supply agreement or other project agreement to which it is a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the aggregate outstanding principal amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project
Parents to third parties will not exceed $600 million at any one time. Such amount is separate and apart from, and in
excess of, the Aggregate General Authority. No more than $200 million principal amount of such non-recourse debt
securities at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In any case in which CSW
directly or indirectly owns less than all of the equity interests of a Project Parent, only that portion of the non-recourse
indebtedness of such Project Parent equal to CSW's equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes of
the foregoing limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSW, Energy, CSWI, CSWdM, CSWdM Servicios and their affiliates further request that no additional authority be required
from the Commission after December 31, 1997 in order to maintain existing Guarantees and/or Investments made prior
to such date in accordance with the Act and all applicable rules, regulations and orders of the Commission. If CSW,
Energy, CSWI, CSWdM or CSWdM Servicios determine to make any additional investments after December 31, 1997, appropriate
authority of the Commission will be sought.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Travelers is a financial services holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries and certain affiliates,
principally in four business segments; investment services, consumer finance services, life insurance services,
and property and casualty services. The Travelers and its subsidiaries are referred to as The Travelers Group. One
of The Travelers' principal indirect subsidiaries, Smith Barney Inc., which is a subsidiary of Smith Barney Holdings,
Inc., is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``1934 Act'') and an investment
adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Travelers proposes to establish the Partnerships to provide investment opportunities for highly compensated
key employees of The Travelers Group (``Eligible Employees''). The Partnerships will allow the Eligible Employees
to diversify their investments, to pool their investment resources and to receive the benefit of certain investment
opportunities that come to the attention of The Travelers Group. Each Partnership will be an ``employees' securities
company'' as that term is defined in section 2(a)(13) of the Act, and will operate as a closed-end, non-diversified,
management investment company. Each Partnership will have a general partner, the executive officers and directors
of which will be Eligible Employees. The affairs of each Partnership will be governed by a limited partnership agreement
to be executed by the general partner and each limited partner who will invest in the Partnership. The Travelers Group
will bear all expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the Partnerships. Units will be sold without
a sales load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Eligible Employees, in addition to being employees, officers or directors of The Travelers Group, will be engaged
in various aspects of the financial services business. They also will be sophisticated investors who are highly compensated
and otherwise able to fend for themselves without benefit of regulatory safeguards, and will be required to meet the
standards for ``accredited investors'' in rule 501(a)(6) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Units in the Partnerships will not be transferable by a limited partner except with the express consent of the general
partner and then only to parties that fall within the class of persons referred to in section 2(a)(13) of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Partnerships may provide that the general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the
units of the limited partners upon the termination of a limited partner's employment with The Travelers Group for
any reason or upon his or her bankruptcy. In addition, the Partnerships may provide that in the event of a limited partner's
death, total physical disability or adjudication of incompetence, the limited partner or his or her representative
may request that the general partner, or its assignee or designee, terminate his or her participation and purchase
the limited partner's interest in the Partnership. The general partner, or its assignee or designee, shall have no
obligation to grant such requests. If granted, however, the general partner, or its assignee or designee, shall pay
the limited partner an amount equal to what the general partner determines in good faith to be the fair market value
of the limited partner's interest as of the semi-annual valuation date preceding the limited partner's termination
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Pending investment, Partnership funds may be invested by the general partner in short-term investments. In compliance
with section 12(d)(1)(A)(1) of the Act, no Partnership will purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by
another investment company if the Partnership immediately after such purchase or acquisition will own in the aggregate
more than 3 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of any such investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Management of each Partnership will be exclusively vested in its general partner, which will be, directly or indirectly,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Travelers. The general partner will make all investment decisions for the Partnerships
and will have all powers and rights necessary to carry out the objectives of each of the Partnerships, except that the
general partner may delegate certain of its responsibilities to a manager. No compensation will be paid to the general
partner for its services except that it may receive reimbursement of its out-of-pocket expenses. No separate management
fee will be charged by the general partner. No compensation will be paid by a Partnership to the directors or officers
of the entity controlling the general partner for their services to the general partner other than reimbursement
for reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the course of conducting the business of the
Partnership. However, expenses charged by the general partner to any Partnerships may include expenses charged
by an entity affiliated with The Travelers Group for services rendered to the Partnership, but without any additional
markup charged to the Partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A general partner and/or manager will register as an investment adviser if required under applicable law. The determination
as to whether a general partner or manager is required to register under the Advisers Act shall be made by The Travelers
Group; no relief in respect to such determination is requested in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Each general partner will undertake to contribute capital to the Partnership in an amount equal to at least 1 percent
of the aggregate amount of capital contributed by the limited partners. A general partner or another member of The
Travelers Group (the ``Electing Partner'') may undertake to contribute capital to a Partnership in an amount up to
ten times the aggregate amount of capital contributed by the limited partners. The limited partnership agreement
of a Partnership may provide that the Electing Partner shall not receive its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
allocation of profits and losses with respect to a specified portion of its capital contribution to the Partnership.
With respect to the portion of the general partner's capital contribution for which it will not receive its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
allocation (the ``Non-Allocable Portion''), the Electing Partner will be entitled to a cumulative return, which
will not be greater than its ``opportunity cost of funds'' with respect to such Non-Allocable Portion (the ``Return'').
The Non-Allocable Portion will be a specified percentage of the amount of cash contributed by the Electing Partner
as determined by The Travelers Group and set forth in the limited partnership agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The ``opportunity cost of funds'' will be, at the election of the general partner made at the time the Partnership
is organized, either; the applicable interest rate, or a fixed rate of return reflecting the yield in Treasury securities
with a term of similar length as the expected average life of the Partnership. The ``applicable interest rate'' will
be, at the election of a general partner made at the time that a Partnership is organized; the prime commercial lending
rate as in effect from time to time, the ``applicable federal rate'' under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue
code of 1984 (or its successors) as determined in the good faith judgment of the general partner, or The Travelers Group's
``effective cost of borrowing'' defined as average effective consolidated borrowing costs for commercial paper,
bank loan and other short term borrowings, computed on a monthly basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. The Return will be allocable annually out of Partnership profits and will be payable to the general partner when
profits are realized by the Partnership or, to the extent not previously paid, upon the liquidation of the Partnership.
The rate of the Return may be more favorable to the Partnership than prevailing market rates for comparable types of
``borrowing'' because a Partnership would receive the benefits of the prime rate or the rate at which the Treasury
borrows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Partnerships' net profits and losses will be allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in the
same proportion as the amount of their respective paid-in capital that was employed to make the investments giving
rise to such profits or losses, except as previously described with respect to the Non-Allocable Portion, if any,
and except that, unless otherwise specifically provided in the limited partnership agreement, the capital accounts
of the limited partners will not be reduced below zero and any additional losses will be allocated to the general partner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Partnership will send its limited partners annual reports regarding its operations and current valuation
of Partnership assets. As soon as practicable after the end of each tax year of a Partnership, a report will be transmitted
to each limited partner setting out information with respect to the limited partner's share of income, gains, losses,
credits and other items for federal income tax purposes, resulting from the operation of the Partnership during that
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The general partner of a Partnership may purchase units which it may offer to new Eligible Employees joining The
Travelers Group after closing of the Partnership. The sale of these units by the general partner will have no dilutive
effect on the interest of already existing limited partners because the units will have already been issued and sold
at the closing of the Partnership.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On behalf of the Partnerships, The Travelers requests an exemption under section 6(b) and 6(e) of the Act from all
provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except section 9, certain provisions of section 17,
and sections 36 through 53 of the Act, and the rules and regulations under those sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Travelers requests an exemption from section 17(a) to permit a Partnership: (a) to purchase from Smith Barney,
or another affiliate of The Travelers, securities or interests in properties previously acquired for the account
of Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers; (b) to purchase interests or property in a company or other investment
vehicle in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers already owns securities; (c) to sell to Smith Barney
or other affiliates of The Travelers securities or interests in properties previously acquired by the Partnerships;
(d) to invest in investment companies, investment partnerships or other investment vehicles offered, sponsored
or managed by Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers (referred to as ``Travelers Sponsored Vehicles''),
or to purchase securities from Travelers Sponsored Vehicles, except that The Travelers will not invest more than
15% of the assets of any Partnership in Travelers Sponsored Vehicles; (e) to invest in securities of, or to lend money
to, entities with which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers have performed investment banking or other
services and from which they may have received fees; (f) to purchase interests in or lend money to a company or other
investment vehicle (i) in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers or their respective employees
own 5% or more of the voting securities or (ii) that is otherwise affiliated with the Partnership or The Travelers;
(g) to purchase securities that are underwritten by Smith Barney or by another affiliate of The Travelers (including
a member of a selling group) on terms at least as favorable to the Partnership as those offered to investors other than
``affiliated persons'' (as defined in the Act) of Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers; and (h) to participate
as a selling security-holder in a public offering (i) that is underwritten by Smith Barney or by another affiliate
of The Travelers or (ii) in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers acts as a member of the selling group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Travelers also requests an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder, subject to the conditions
specified below, to permit a Partnership to make an investment in an entity in which a Partnership, Smith Barney or
another affiliate of The Travelers, or any ``affiliated persons'' (as defined in the Act) of the Partnership or an
``affiliated person'' of such person also invests or participates or plans concurrently or otherwise directly or
indirectly to invest or become a participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Travelers requests an exemption from the requirements, contained in rules 17f&hyph;1(a) and 17f&hyph;1(c),
that the custodial agreement between The Travelers Group and a Partnership must be in writing and transmitted to the
SEC. Requiring a written contract and transmission to the SEC would unnecessarily burden The Travelers and cause
unnecessary expense to The Travelers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Travelers requests an exemption from the requirements, contained in rule 17g&hyph;1(d), (e), and (g), that
a majority of the board of directors of the entity controlling the general partner who are not interested persons take
certain actions and make certain approvals concerning bonding and request instead that the actions and approvals
required by the rule to be taken by the board of directors may and will be taken by officers and directors, regardless
of whether they are ``interested.''

6. The Travelers requests an exemption from rule 17j&hyph;1, except rule 17j&hyph;1(a). Rule 17j&hyph;1 requires
that every access person of a registered investment company report to the investment company with respect to transactions
in any security in which the access person has any beneficial ownership in the security. Applicant believes that the
community of interests among the partners of the Partnerships and the conditions described below provide adequate
safeguards. The Travelers does not seek an exemption from, and the Partnerships will comply with, the anti-fraud
provisions of paragraph (a) of rule 17j&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Travelers believes that the exemptions requested under section 6(b) of the Act are consistent with the protection
of investors. The exemptions are being requested because they are considered necessary or relevant to the operations
of the Partnerships as an investment program uniquely adapted to the needs of employees of The Travelers Group. The
Travelers further believes that the requested relief is consistent with the legislative history relating to employees'
securities companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Travelers also believes that a substantial community of economic and other interests exists among The Travelers
Group and the limited partners which obviates the need for protection of investors under the Act. The Partnerships
will be conceived, organized and managed by persons who will be investing in the Partnerships, and will not be promoted
by persons seeking to profit from fees or investment advice or from the distribution of securities. The travelers
also believes that the terms of the proposed affiliated transactions will be reasonable and fair and free from overreaching,
and will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned.

Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant will comply with the following conditions if the requested order is granted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each proposed transaction involving a Partnership otherwise prohibited by section 17(A) or section 17(D) of the
Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder (the ``section 17 transactions'') will be effected only if the general partner
determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable to the
partners and do not involve overreaching of the Partnership or its partners on the part of any person concerned; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the transaction is consistent with the interests of the partners, the Partnership's organizational documents
and the Partnership's reports to its partners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the general partners will record and preserve a description of such affiliated transactions, their
findings, the information or materials upon which their findings are based and the basis therefor. All such records
will be maintained for the life of the Partnerships and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination
by the Commission and its staff.

2. In connection with the section 17 transactions, the general partner will adopt, and periodically review and update,
procedures designed to ensure that reasonable inquiry is made, prior to the consummation of any such transaction,
with respect to the possible involvement in the transaction of any affiliated person or promoter of or principal underwriter
for the Partnerships, or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The general partner will not invest the funds of any Partnership in any investment in which an Affiliated Co-Investor
has or proposes to acquire the same class of securities of the same issuer, where the investment involves a joint enterprise
or other joint arrangement within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1 in which the Partnership and an Affiliated Co-Investor
are participants, unless any such Affiliated Co-Investor, prior to disposing of all or part of its investment, (a)
gives the general partner sufficient, but not less than one day's, notice of its intent to dispose of its investment,
and (b) refrains from disposing of its investment unless the Partnership has the opportunity to dispose of the Partnership's
investment prior to or concurrently with, on the same terms as, and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with the Affiliated Co-Investor. The term ``Affiliated Co-Investor'' means any person who is: (1) an ``affiliated
person'' (as such term is defined in the Act) of the Partnership; (2) a member of The Travelers Group; (3) an officer
or director of a member of the Travelers Group; (4) a travelers sponsored vehicle; or (5) a company in which an officer
or director of the general partner acts as an officer, director, or general partner, or has a similar capacity to control
the sale or other disposition of the company's securities. The restrictions contained in this condition, however,
shall not be deemed to limit or prevent the disposition of an investment by an Affiliated Co-Investor: (a) to its direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, to any company (a ``parent'') of which the Affiliated Co-Investor is a direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, or to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent; (b) to immediate
family members of the Affiliated Co-Investor or a trust established for any Affiliated Co-Investor or any such family
member; or (c) when the investment is comprised of securities that are (i) listed on a national securities exchange
registered under section 6 of the 1934 Act, (ii) national market system securities pursuant to section 11A(1)(2)
of the 1934 Act and rule 11A(a)(2)&hyph;1 thereunder, or (iii) government securities as defined in section 2(a)(16)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Partnership and its general partner will maintain and preserve, for the life of each such Partnership and at
least two years thereafter, such accounts, books, and other documents as constitute the record forming the basis
for the audited financial statements that are to be provided to the partners, and each annual report of such Partnership
required by the terms of the applicable partnership agreement to be sent to the partners, and agree that all such records
will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.

5. The general partner will send to each limited partner who had an interest in the Partnership, at any time during the
fiscal year then ended, Partnership financial statements audited by the Partnership's independent accountants.
At the end of each fiscal year, the general partner will make a valuation or have a valuation made of all of the assets
of the Partnership as of such fiscal year end. In addition, within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of each of
the Partnerships or as soon as practicable thereafter, the general partner shall send a report to each person who was
a limited partner at any time during the fiscal year then ended, setting forth such tax information as shall be necessary
for the preparation by the limited partner of his or her federal and state income tax returns and a report of the investment
activities of the Partnership during such year.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Academic Programs of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
announces an open competition for an assistance award program. Accredited post-secondary U.S. educational institutions
and U.S. scholarly/professional organizations are invited to submit proposals to conduct exchange programs with
post-secondary educational institutions in Croatia and Macedonia. The purpose of the exchange programs is to develop
curricula and teaching methodologies for foreign faculties in the field of business management. USIA anticipates
awarding one grant not to exceed $300,000 for a project in Macedonia, and one grant not to exceed $200,000 for a project
in Croatia. Public or private non-profit organizations applying under this program must meet the provisions described
in IRS regulation 501(c)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grant activities should begin no later than February 1, 1995. Programs must be a minimum of 18 months and a maximum of
two years in duration. Activities must include placement of U.S. faculty at Croatian or Macedonian institutions
for in-country training of foreign faculty and for development of sustainable programs to educate future foreign
business management teachers and business people. Targeted program activities may include: Faculty development
and enrichment; curriculum design; modernization of the administrative structures within the foreign institution;
outreach to the private sector; and direct teaching. U.S. and foreign participants may include post-graduate students
on a ``faculty track'' who are currently involved in teaching at participating institutions (not to exceed 25% of
all participants). Development of linkages with the private sector and development of appropriate materials are
encouraged. Orientation, seminar, workshop and semester-long course formats will be acceptable. Visits to partner
institutions by staff or consultants to plan joint projects may be funded under this program but should be a relatively
small part of the overall exchange. Applicants are strongly encouraged to maintain an in-country presence at the
foreign partner institution(s) for the duration of the program. This presence should include project director(s)
at the partner institution(s) for periods of at least one continuous academic semester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Courses developed may include, but are not limited to: Marketing, production management, economics, industrial
relations, finance, accounting, international business and business communications. Proposals must provide
for a two-way exchange. Exchange activities should include establishment of electronic communications between
partner institutions and other organizations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Programs must
also maintain their scholarly integrity and meet the highest standard of academic excellence or artistic achievement.
``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to
race, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are
strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle.

market economies through the development of business management training capabilities in academic institutions.
An important goal of the program is to create enduring linkages between designated foreign and U.S. institutions.
Proposals that are extensions or enhancements of past or current relationships with a partner institution will be
accepted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Institutional Commitment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In making award decisions, USIA will focus especially on evidence of an ongoing commitment by the U.S. partner to internationalizing
its educational programs as well as a commitment by both partner institutions to the success of the particular exchange
program. Each proposal must include documentation of institutional support for the proposed program in the form
of signed letters of endorsement from the president, chancellor, or director of the U.S. and foreign institution(s)
involved. The documentation may also be submitted in the form of a signed agreement by the same persons. Each agreement
or letter of endorsement must describe the institution's commitment to an on-going partnership and make specific
reference to the proposed program and how it will fit into and be supported by the institution's current activities
in internationalizing its educational programs. Proposals must discuss on how the partnership will be continued
beyond the period of the grant award. If not submitted with original proposal, documentation of support from foreign
institutions must be received by 5 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on October 24, 1994, addressed to Robin Kline or Mary
Ann Garlic, E/ASU, Room 349, U.S. Information Agency, 301 4th Street SW., Washington, DC 20547. Applicant institutions
are required to make their own arrangements with the appropriate foreign institutions regarding institutional
commitment and visas, and the proposal must make reference to this requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Budget:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 USIA anticipates awarding one grant not to exceed $300,000 for a project in Macedonia, and one grant not to exceed $200,000
for a project in Croatia. Institutions must submit a comprehensive line item budget, including a budget summary page,
based on the specific guidance in the Application Package. USIA will not pay for indirect costs under this program;
however, indirect costs may be included as part of an institution's cost sharing. Requesting USIA support for indirect
costs will result in technical ineligibility. Proposals must demonstrate substantial cost-sharing (dollar and
in-kind) in both program and administrative categories, including overseas partner contributions. Cost-sharing
may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient must maintain written records to support all
allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as cost to be paid by the
Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions
must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E. Cost-sharing and matching should be described in the proposal.
In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget,
the USIA contribution will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA reserves the right to reduce, increase or otherwise modify proposal budgets in accordance with the needs of the
program. For organizations with less than four years of experience in international exchange activities, grants
will be limited to a maximum of $60,000. Administrative costs cannot exceed 20 percent of the requested budget, including
administrative expenses for orientation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable costs for the program include the following (see Application Package for further details):

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice amends the FY 94 NOFA for Indian Applicants under the HOME Program (59 FR 11424; March 10, 1994) at section
I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which deals with the selection criteria pertaining to environmental review. The amendment is
made to reflect changes resulting from The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDR ACT)
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, approved April 11, 1994). The changes involve removing the requirement that after rating
and ranking but before selection for award, HUD Field ONAPs will perform an environmental review of applications
in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, and that applications may be reranked or disqualified on the basis of the environmental
review. These provisions are replaced with the provision that after rating and ranking, applicants with the highest
scores will be selected and offered awards. The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental
review of the project under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental
review and obtains a release of funds from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities
are exempt from review under 24 CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would
not have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. However, a grantee may expend
HOME or other funds on environmental reviews, exempt under 24 CFR part 58, before obtaining a release of funds to be
used for non-exempt purposes from HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice adds a new paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(E) which clarifies that unsuccessful applicants may notify the ONAP,
within 90 days of being informed of their score, of computational errors in the rating and ranking. This paragraph
provides for the correction of such errors in rating and ranking and, if the error denied funding of the applicant,
provides for funding the application in subsequent funding cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also amends Appendix 1 of the FY 1994 Indian Home Program NOFA by including a new address for the Denver Office
of Native American Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following modifications are made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;5535 to the NOFA titled, ``NOFA For Fiscal Year
1994 For Indian Applicants Under The HOME Program'', published on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11424): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On page 11429, paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(C), which appears in the first column, is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ranking process will produce an ordered list of projects that may receive funding. The order is established by
the number of points the project received in the rating process. The eligibility requirement for further consideration
will be 50 out of 100 points. Project applications scoring lower than 50 points will be set aside as non-responsive
and ineligible. After rating and ranking, applicants with the highest scores will be selected and offered awards.
The grantee must assume responsibility for completing the environmental review of the project under 24 CFR part 58.
In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, until the grantee completes its environmental review and obtains a release of funds
from HUD, the grantee may not commit HOME funds to activities (unless the activities are exempt from review under 24
CFR part 58), or expend any other funds for activities unless they are exempt or would not have an adverse environmental
impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Environmental studies are exempt under 24 CFR part 58 and therefore
a grantee may expend HOME or other funds on environmental reviews before obtaining a release of funds to be used for
non-exempt purposes from HUD. For the purposes of geographic diversity, HUD may award at least one grant to each of
the areas covered by the Offices of Indian Programs listed in Appendix 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. On page 11429, a new paragraph I.(e)(4)(iii)(E) is added to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Errors in rating and ranking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants may bring computational errors in the rating and ranking of applications to the attention of ONAP within
90 days of being informed of their score. If an ONAP review determines that there was a computational error that denied
funding to the applicant, the applicant will be funded out of remaining funds in the challenged round of funding, or
out of the next available round of funding.
