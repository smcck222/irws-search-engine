SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule increases the current minimum size requirements for kiwifruit grown in California and for kiwifruit
imported into the United States that are shipped to the fresh market. The minimum size requirement is increasing from
Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per
8-pound sample. This rule will prevent shipments of low-quality, undersized kiwifruit from having a negative effect
on the market.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 920 [7 CFR Part 920], as amended, regulating the handling of kiwifruit
grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified commodities,
including kiwifruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United
States are prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements as
those in effect for the domestically produced commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 65 handlers subject to regulation under the order and about 600 producers of California kiwifruit.
There are approximately 75 importers of kiwifruit. Small agricultural service firms, which include kiwifruit handlers
and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$500,000. A majority of these handlers, importers, and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the marketing order, fresh market shipments of California kiwifruit are required to be inspected
and are subject to grade, size, maturity, pack, and container requirements. Current requirements include specifications
that such shipments be at least Size 49, grade at least KAC No. 1 quality, and contain a minimum of 6.5 percent soluble
solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production of California kiwifruit for the 1993 season was approximately 12.3 million tray equivalents, compared
to the 1992 season production of 13.3 million tray equivalents. This represents an 8 percent decrease in California
kiwifruit production from 1992 to 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Kiwifruit Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing
order, met on February 10, 1994, and recommended increasing the minimum size requirement from Size 49, which is defined
as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The marketing order authorizes under &sect;920.52(a)(2) the establishment of minimum size requirements. &sect;920.302(a)(2)
of the rules and regulations outlines the minimum size requirements for fresh shipments of California kiwifruit.
Section 920.302(a)(4)(ii) includes a table that specifies numerical size designations that are used to determine
kiwifruit sizes. These size designations are defined by numerical counts, which establish the maximum number of
fruit per 8-pound sample for each of the established sizes. The size designation table defines ten different sizes,
beginning with Size 21 (the largest size) and ending with Size 49 (the smallest size). The committee recommended eliminating
the Size 49 designation (60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample) and redefining the Size 45/46 designation (57 pieces
of fruit per 8-pound sample) as a Size 45 designation (55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended increasing the minimum size requirement because of the blending and packing of undersized
fruit into containers using the Size 49 designation. Current pack requirements specify that kiwifruit designated
as Size 45/46 or below must be packed within a 1/4 inch size tolerance. Undersized fruit (Size 49 kiwifruit near or below
the lower limit of the size tolerance) is often blended into the Size 49 designation. It is a common practice throughout
the industry to blend and pack kiwifruit that could be designated as either undersized fruit, Size 49, or Size 45/46
into a Size 49 container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blending occurs because adjoining size designations have size tolerances that partially overlap and kiwifruit
within either size tolerance may be packed in either size designation. For example, the current Size 49 designation
and the current Size 45/46 designation have only a 3-count difference per 8-pound sample. This amounts to only a 0.12
ounce difference per individual fruit. The equipment and time needed to detect such a difference when packing individual
fruit would be cost prohibitive, so instead, handlers choose to blend sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blending has become more prevalent in recent years because a greater percentage of kiwifruit is being packed in volume-fill
or bulk containers in which the fruit is packed ``loosely'' instead of in containers with molded trays. Without the
constraints of a molded tray, there is more freedom to blend sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee's intention in recommending this increase in the minimum size requirement is to eliminate shipments
of undersized fruit that is blended into the Size 49 designation. This undersized kiwifruit tends to soften more rapidly
during storage than larger fruit and becomes more susceptible to decay. This tendency for undersized fruit to soften
more rapidly than larger fruit becomes more pronounced once it leaves a controlled environment and enters an uncontrolled
one such as a retail shelf. The end result is that the consumer is more likely to encounter quality defects with undersized
fruit then with larger fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminating fresh shipments of undersized fruit by increasing the minimum size requirement improves overall quality
and increases uniformity of pack size. The consumer benefits by being offered a higher quality kiwifruit that ripens
properly without prematurely shriveling or softening. Also, grower returns are expected to increase due to less
repack loss, better kiwifruit movement, and higher prices because of a better quality product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also ample evidence to show that the market is adverse to smaller sizes. The California Kiwifruit Commission
(commission) funded an independent survey titled ``Fresh Kiwifruit: Views from the Trade,'' in 1993. This survey
indicated that 30% of the trade rejects small sizes and that 86.1% of the trade prefers Size 42 (defined as 50 pieces
of fruit per 8-pound sample) or larger. Also, 92.1% of the merchandisers and produce managers claim that their customers
reject small sizes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An example of how consumers reject smaller sizes is when kiwifruit is sold at the retail level out of 125 pound bulk bins.
Consumers initially pick out the largest and higher quality kiwifruit, and displays are left with undersized and
low quality kiwifruit that is rejected by later consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee's recommendation that the minimum size requirement be set at Size 45 will not significantly lower the
volume of kiwifruit available in the fresh market. Although the committee reports that 12.1% of the California kiwifruit
packout for the 1993/94 season was designated as Size 49, most of this total could be blended into the Size 45 designation
because of the small difference between the two size designations. The practice of blending sizes makes it difficult
to predict how much fruit will be eliminated by this rule, however, the committee estimates that the total packout
will be reduced by only 1%. In addition, growers could adjust pruning, thinning, fertilizing, and irrigation techniques
so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit will meet the higher size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is general agreement in the industry for the need to eliminate the packing of undersize fruit. Other alternatives
have been suggested to eliminate shipments of low quality, undersized fruit, but would not adequately address the
problem. One suggestion was to eliminate the blending of sizes by eliminating the size tolerances. This is not a realistic
alternative, because as mentioned earlier, it would be cost prohibitive and impossible to achieve using today's
packing methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another suggestion was to measure size by passing a fruit through a template with an opening large enough for an undersized
fruit to fall through, but too small for a kiwifruit that meets the minimum size requirement to fall through. This template
would be used to determine whether a fruit was undersized. However, this alternative does not take into consideration
that kiwifruit grows in different shapes so that a heavier fruit that is short and broad could fall through a template
while a lighter fruit that is long and narrow would not. Weight is currently used to measure size and is the most accurate
measure of a kiwifruit's size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative presented at the meeting was to tighten the maturity requirements rather than the size standards
so that undersized, immature fruit would not be shipped. However, not all undersized fruit is immature, but undersized
fruit does tend to be more susceptible to quality problems. Thus, this alternative would not fully address the problem
of blending in undersized fruit of inferior quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, another alternative presented at the meeting was to establish Size 45 as the minimum size, but continue to
define it as 57 pieces of fruit instead of 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample as recommended by the committee. However,
because of the approximately 0.12 ounce difference between a Size 45 kiwifruit defined as 57 pieces of fruit per 8-pound
sample and a Size 49 kiwifruit defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, this alternative would not go far enough
to prevent the blending of undersized fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8e of the Act provides that when certain domestically produced commodities, including kiwifruit, are regulated
under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality,
and maturity requirements. Since this rule increases the minimum size requirement under the domestic handling regulations,
a corresponding change to the import regulations must also be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for kiwifruit imported into the United States are currently
in effect under &sect;944.550 (7 CFR 944.550). The minimum size requirement is specified in paragraph (a) of &sect;944.550.
This rule increases the minimum size requirement for imported kiwifruit from Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces
of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the minimum size requirement for importers of kiwifruit will also have a beneficial impact. This rule
eliminates quality problems associated with undersized imported kiwifruit as it will for undersized domestic kiwifruit.
In addition, the domestic trade's preference for larger size kiwifruit applies to imported kiwifruit as well as domestic
kiwifruit. Thus, importers will benefit by improving the overall quality of kiwifruit shipments and increasing
sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the June 29, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 33451], with a 30-day comment period ending July 29, 1994. Two comments were received, one in favor and the other
in opposition to the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Committee and reiterated the arguments made in the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second comment was submitted by a grower, Gregory W. Davis, who opposed the proposed rule. Mr Davis commented that
in his view the rule is a volume control measure that forces growers to dump marketable kiwifruit. This rule is not a
volume control measure. Its intention is to eliminate the blending of undersized fruit. In addition, growers retain
the option of adjusting their cultural practices so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit will meet the new size requirement.
Also, the order does not force growers or handlers to dump fruit. The following outlets are exempt from grade, size,
maturity, quality, inspection, and container requirements including: (1) Shipments of less than 200 pounds per
day; (2) roadside stands; (3) Certified Farmers Markets; (4) charitable institutions; (5) relief agencies; and
(6) commercial processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis also commented that growers in his district (District 7) are against increasing the minimum size requirement
and that District 7, which includes Tulare and Inyo counties in Central California, represents almost one-third
of California kiwifruit production. However, some District 7 committee members and alternates, who like all members
of the committee were elected by growers from their District, voted in favor of increasing the minimum size requirement
in the various subcommittee and committee meetings that took place this past year. A committee member from District
7 reported at the February 10, 1994, meeting that a majority of growers were against increasing the minimum size requirement,
but almost all growers were in favor of eliminating the blending of undersize fruit. After a long, thorough, and publicized
debate, the committee determined that increasing the minimum size to Size 45 from Size 49 is the best way to eliminate
the blending of undersize fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis also commented that a redistricting scheduled for next year might change the vote on the minimum size requirement.
The Department has yet to receive a formal recommendation from the committee on this issue. It is premature to assume
that any redistricting will take place or that a newly seated committee would vote any differently on a minimum size
requirement. The present committee was nominated by growers and appointed by the Secretary according to marketing
order procedures. If a redistricting plan is recommended and approved, and if a new committee is selected, then that
committee may recommend revisions to the minimum size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis' comment further stated that since the recommendation was made on February 10, 1994, he and other growers
did not have sufficient time to adjust their cultural practices so that a higher percentage of the 1994 crop will meet
the higher size requirement. However, Mr. Davis indicates that he was present at the subcommittee meeting held in
Modesto, California on December 8, 1993, in which the subcommittee initially recommended increasing the minimum
size requirement. In addition, the January 1994 bulletin of California Kiwifruit, which is jointly produced by the
commission and the committee, announced the December 8, 1993, subcommittee's preliminary recommendation to increase
the minimum size requirement. This publication is mailed to all known kiwifruit growers. Finally, other kiwifruit
growers indicate that cultural practices, such as thinning, are available during February or later to increase kiwifruit
size so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit meet the new size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis' comment went on to question the wisdom of preventing shipments of kiwifruit that he considers to be of good
quality. However, quality is a term that is often defined by changing consumers preferences. The independent survey
funded by the commission is an attempt to identify current consumer preferences and clearly shows that many consumers
are adverse to smaller sizes. It is reasonable to require kiwifruit shipments to meet customer preferences for larger
sizes. Otherwise, California kiwifruit will not be as marketable as kiwifruit from international competitors who
meet customer preferences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Mr. Davis suggested that the committee lacked formal research that shows Size 49 or smaller kiwifruit is
not of good quality. As mentioned earlier, the independent market survey does show an overwhelming trade preference
for sizes 42 or larger. Although no formal research was specifically conducted on customer preference for Size 49
kiwifruit or smaller kiwifruit, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience among growers about the
marketing of kiwifruit. It is the view of a majority of committee members, which is made up of growers, that shipments
of undersized kiwifruit have been poorly received by consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After thoroughly analyzing the comments received and other available information, the Department has concluded
that this final rule is appropriate.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) amends its regulations governing who will decide appeals of formal size
determinations and appeals of Standard Industrial Classification code designations authorized under its regulations.
Instead of a three-judge panel at SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), these appeals will now be decided by a
single administrative judge at OHA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA is committed to enhancing its delivery of services to the small business community which it serves. SBA is in the
process of changing its structure to move resources to SBA's various district offices to better serve small businesses.
This restructuring includes SBA's OHA, which has lost several administrative judges to other offices within SBA
or to retirement. Currently, SBA's size regulations authorize a three-judge panel within OHA to decide appeals of
formal size determinations and appeals of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code designations assigned
to certain Government contracts. The assignment of a three judge panel to hear and decide these appeals is no longer
feasible with the reduction in the number of judges at OHA. This final regulation will change the requirement that
a three-judge panel decide size and SIC code appeals to a single administrative judge. It will also change other references
to such a ``panel'' in 13 CFR 121.1701 through 121.1722 to an administrative judge or the Presiding Judge instead.
Because this provision is a procedural rule, it is adopted as a final rule without the necessity of a proposed rule and
an opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.),
and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA certifies that this final rule will not be considered a significant rule within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 and will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule merely changes who will resolve size and SIC code appeals under SBA's regulations. It does not otherwise
affect these appeals, and has no bearing on the number of appeals brought or the contracting actions underlying the
appeals. It will have no effect on the amount or dollar value of any Government contract requirement or the number of
requirements that are subject to SBA's size and SIC code regulations. As such, it is not likely to have an annual economic
effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on
competition or the United States economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this final rule contains no new reporting
or recordkeeping requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule does not have any federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance
with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1993, the President ordered a review of U.S. policy regarding the domestic use of, and export controls on,
encryption technology. That review resulted in a determination that vital U.S. interests_national security, economic,
and law enforcement_compel maintaining appropriate control of encryption. It also revealed that there are measures
which can be taken to reform the existing export controls to ensure that controls are not unduly burdensome to U.S.
exporters. On February 4, 1994, the Department of State announced reforms to the export control procedures applicable
to products incorporating encryption technology.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule implements one of these reforms. Previously, almost every encryption export required an individual
license. Only those exports covered by a distribution arrangement could be shipped without an individual license.
This final rule, which adds a &sect;124.15 to the ITAR, provides for a licensing procedure which permits direct distribution
from the U.S. manufacturer, thus reducing the regulatory burden on exporters without a foreign distributor. The
number of individual license applications required will also be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this new licensing arrangement, U.S. encryption manufacturers may ship their products covered in Category
XIII(b)(1) from the United States directly to customers within approved countries without obtaining individual
licenses for each end user. The procedures are similar to existing distribution agreement procedures. Exporters
are required to submit a proposed arrangement identifying, among other things, specific items to be shipped, proposed
end users and end use and countries to which the items are destined. Upon approval of the arrangement, exporters will
be permitted to ship the specified products directly to end users in the approved countries based on a single license.
Therefore, manufacturers of products covered in Category XIII(b)(1) will now have the option to export to foreign
distributors under a distribution agreement or directly from the U.S. under the new arrangement.

immediately by publication of a final rule. Notwithstanding this final rule, public comment is welcomed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Parole Commission is adopting a rule that permits parole hearings for eligible federal prisoners to be conducted
by a single hearing examiner. Formerly, parole hearings were conducted by panels of two examiners, with single-examiner
hearings being the exception. The final rule issued today makes single examiner hearings the norm, with the Commission
having the option to order panel hearings when appropriate. Review and voting by the Regional Administrator will
provide the Regional Commissioner with a panel recommendation of two examiners before a decision is rendered. The
rule will also permit a hearing examiner (or panel) to withhold the recommended decision that is usually given to the
prisoner at the conclusion of a parole hearing, if a critical issue requires further consideration. The purpose served
by this final rule is to adjust the Commission's procedures to the down-sizing requirements of the Commission's impending
abolition, without lessening the quality of justice in parole hearings and decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public comment was solicited by publication of an interim rule at 47 FR 11186 (March 10, 1994). Comment was received
from the University of Southern California Law Center (USCLC), the Federal Public Defenders for the Central District
of California and the Western District of Pennsylvania, and several federal prisoners. This comment was uniformly
negative, and emphasized the aura of fairness that is assertedly lost when parole hearings are conducted by a single
examiner. Moreover, the public comment advanced various legal arguments to the effect that due process, and the intent
of Congress in the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, mandate the Commission to continue conducting
parole hearings with panels of two examiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the constitutional and legal arguments advanced in the public comment, the Commission has rejected
those arguments. Contrary to the public comment from the USCLC, the legislative history to the 1986 amendment to 18
U.S.C. &sect;4208 clearly states that Congress intended the Parole Commission to ``utilize its resources most efficiently''
by having one examiner conduct the parole hearing, with the second examiner reviewing the case on the record. 132 Cong.
Rec. H11291, 11293 (daily ed. Oct. 17, 1986) (remarks of Rep. Berman). Moreover, the analogy drawn in the public comment
between the right of a parolee to due process under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Morrissey v. Brewer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
408 U.S. 470 (1972), and the right of an eligible prisoner to a parole hearing, is not a correct analogy. A parole hearing
is not designed to test the credibility of live witnesses, but serves the limited purposes of providing the prisoner
with an opportunity: (1) to ensure that the records under consideration by the Parole Commission are, in fact, the
records relating to his case; and (2) to present any special considerations demonstrating why he is an appropriate
candidate for parole. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
442 U.S. 1, 15 (1979). Even under the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, single-examiner hearings
were permitted in special situations, thus precluding the assumption, advocated in the public comment, that Congress
made a two-examiner panel a legal necessity regardless of the circumstances. The 1976 law also permitted parole revocation
hearings under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to be conducted by a single examiner. Hence, the arguments that the Parole Commission is precluded by law from responding
to the circumstances created by its abolition in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, are without merit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the Parole Commission is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the prisoners themselves for maintaining
the fairness of parole consideration, especially with regard to the deliberations that precede the panel recommendation
to the Regional Commissioner. To this end, the Commission will institute every reasonable measure to ensure thorough
consideration by the Regional Administrator, who will participate as a panel member in arriving at a well-considered,
independent evaluation of the prisoner's case. Although the presence of two hearing examiners provides an eligible
prisoner with the outward assurance of fairness, the ultimate fairness of the deliberations that go into a parole
decision is not diminished if the absent secondary examiner is given more opportunity for reflection and study of
the case file in the regional office, than would be possible when examiners are obliged to complete a docket of hearings
in an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the restraints imposed upon the U.S. Parole Commission by its impending abolition on November 1, 1997, require
that the Commission balance the objective of a fair parole hearing with the need for appropriate conservation of limited
staff resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment was also received with regard to the provision permitting an examiner to forego the recommended decision
normally announced at the conclusion of a parole hearing. The Commission agrees that this should be an extraordinary
procedure, and should not be invoked by hearing examiners on a routine basis. The Commission will monitor the practices
of its hearing examiners to ensure that overuse of this provision (as predicted in some of the public comment) will
not occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Parole Commission has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of
Executive Order 12866 and the rule has therefore not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule
will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, within the meaning of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

(a) There is hereby delegated to hearing examiners the authority necessary to conduct hearings and to make recommendations
relative to the grant or denial of parole or reparole, revocation or reinstatement of parole or mandatory release,
and conditions of parole. Any hearing may be conducted by a single examiner or by a panel of examiners. A Regional Administrator
shall function as a hearing examiner for the purpose of obtaining a panel recommendation whenever the Regional Commissioner
has not ordered that a hearing be conducted by a panel of two examiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The concurrence of two hearing examiners, or of a hearing examiner and the Regional Administrator, shall be required
to obtain a panel recommendation to the Regional Commissioner. A panel recommendation is required in each case decided
by a Regional Commissioner after the holding of a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An examiner panel recommendation consists of two concurring examiner votes. In the event of divergent votes,
the case shall be referred to another hearing examiner (or to the Regional Administrator in the case of a hearing conducted
by a panel of examiners) for another vote. If concurring votes do not result from such a referral, the case shall be referred
to any available hearing examiner until a panel recommendation is obtained.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 6, 1993, Congress enacted section 9 of Public Law 103&hyph;94, titled Garnishment of Federal Employees'
Pay. This law is a limited waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity to permit pay from an agency to an employee
to be garnished by state and local garnishment orders, subject to certain limitations. Child support garnishment
is already covered by other Federal law. On February 3, 1994, the President signed Executive Order 12897, which delegated
responsibility to the Postal Service to issue implementing regulations for its employees and for the employees of
the Postal Rate Commission. These regulations are in accordance with this delegation of authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service is designating one Authorized Agent to receive garnishment orders under section 9 of Public Law
103&hyph;94. This Federal law supersedes state law with regard to service of garnishment process. Accordingly,
regardless of state law, legal process must be sent directly to, or served in person upon, the Authorized Agent named
in these regulations. There will be only one agent for receipt of process for all garnishments of an employee's pay
arising under state law. Other Postal Service employees are not authorized to receive process nor are they permitted
to transmit process to the Authorized Agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This waiver of immunity for the garnishment process confers jurisdiction only over an employee's pay, and does not
confer jurisdiction over the Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission as a party to a lawsuit, nor does it waive
immunity for the purpose of orders to show cause or for sanctions such as default judgments. These regulations also
announce a change in the agent for service of process for child support garnishments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 659 and supersede
the designations at 5 CFR 581 Appendix A III of agents to accept service of process on behalf of the United States Postal
Service and the Postal Rate Commission in child support and/or alimony garnishments.

Notwithstanding the designation, in &sect;2.2 of this title, of the General Counsel as agent for the receipt of legal
process against the Postal Service, the sole agent for service of garnishment process directed to the pay of Postal
Service employees and employees of the Postal Rate Commission (``employees'') is the Manager, Payroll Processing
Branch, 1 Federal Drive, Ft. Snelling, MN 55111&hyph;9650 (``Authorized Agent''). The Authorized Agent shall have
sole authority to receive service of legal process in the nature of garnishment (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as ``process'') arising under the law of any state, territory, or possession, or the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction of any state, territory, or possession (including any order for child support and alimony). No process
shall be effectively served until it is received by the office of the Authorized Agent. No other employee shall have
the authority to accept service of such process. Service of process in conformity with Rule 4(i) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure is not waived for any suit or action wherein the Postal Service, its officers, or employees are parties.

Service of process on the Authorized Agent may be made in person or by certified or registered mail, with return receipt
requested, at the address of the Authorized Agent. Service may also be made on the Authorized Agent by means of any private
delivery service pursuant to its authority for the private carriage of letters under an exception to the Private Express
Statutes, 39 U.S.C. 601&hyph;606, provided that the private delivery organization issues a receipt bearing the
name and address of both the addressee and sender, as well as the date of delivery and the signature of the receiving
agent. No garnishment is effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent regardless of the chosen
mode of delivery. Process addressed to, delivered to, or in any manner given to any employee, other than the Authorized
Agent, may, at the sole discretion of the employee, be returned to the issuing court marked ``Not Effectively Served.''
A copy of or reference to these regulations may be included. Employees are not authorized to redirect or forward garnishment
process to the Authorized Agent. In the event that the address of the Authorized Agent is changed, mail may be forwarded
from his or her last published address to the new official address until such time as these regulations are amended
to reflect the new address.

No document purporting to garnish employee wages shall be deemed sufficient unless it can be determined from the face

or an authorized official pursuant to an order of such a court or pursuant to state or local law, evidenced by a signature
of the issuing person; and that it contains the name of the garnished party, with his or her social security number,
orders the employing agency to withhold from pay a specific amount of money, specifically describes the judgment
of debt or administrative action complete with statutory citation and contains specific advice as to where to send
the funds withheld including the complete ZIP Code (ZIP+4). Documents deficient in any of these respects may be returned
to the issuing court or authorized official inscribed ``Insufficient as to legal form.''

with the name and social security number on the garnishment will not be processed. An exact match of both name and social
security number is required in order to permit processing; otherwise, the garnishment will be returned marked ``Insufficient
identifying information.'' Garnishments that are insufficient in regard to identifying information will not be
held pending receipt of further information.

shall respond, in writing, to the garnishment or interrogatories within 30 days of receipt of process. The Authorized
Agent may respond within a longer period of time as may be prescribed by applicable state Law. Neither the Authorized
Agent nor any employee shall be required to respond in person to any garnishment served according to the provisions
of 5 U.S.C. 5520a and the regulations in this section.

No employee whose duties include responding to interrogatories to garnishments shall release information in response
to a garnishment until it is determined that sufficient information, as required in &sect;491.4 above, has been received
in writing as part of the garnishment legal process. The Authorized Agent may, at his or her sole discretion, accept
or initiate telephone inquiries concerning garnishments. No other employee may release any information about employees
except in conformity with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the regulations in 39 CFR part 266, Privacy of Information.

All legal process in the nature of garnishment shall be date- and time-stamped by the Authorized Agent when received
for the purpose of determining the order of receipt of process that is sufficient as to legal form and contains sufficient
information for identification of the employee, the Authorized Agent's date- and time-stamp shall be conclusive
evidence. Child support and alimony garnishments will be accorded priority over commercial garnishments under
5 U.S.C. 5520a as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5520a(h)(2). Garnishments shall be executed if the pay cycle is open for input
or, if closed, will be held until the next cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the final rule regarding retrofit/rebuild requirements for 1993 and earlier model year urban buses (58 FR 21359,
April 21, 1993), EPA stated that it would review retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1994 and publish
the post-rebuild particulate matter emission levels for urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild
levels are to be used by operators for calculating their fleet emission levels under Option 2. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 document fulfills that commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As of July 1, 1994, no equipment had been certified for the Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program. Operators choosing
to comply with Option 2 during 1995 and 1996 must use the PM levels as specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild
PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild PM level'' in the table provided at 40 CFR &sect;85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A).

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 219(d) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to promulgate regulations that require certain 1993 and earlier model
year urban buses having engines, which are replaced or rebuilt after January 1, 1995, comply with an emission standard
or control technology reflecting the best retrofit technology and maintenance practices reasonably achievable.
On April 21, 1993, EPA published final Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses
(58 FR 21359). The Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program requires affected operators of urban buses to choose between
two compliance options. Option 1 establishes particulate matter (PM) emissions requirements for each urban bus
in an operator's fleet whose engine is rebuilt or replaced. Option 2 is a fleet averaging program that sets out specific
annual target levels for average PM emissions from urban buses in an operator's fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, EPA stated that it would review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1, 1994, and publish the post-rebuild PM emission levels for
urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild levels are to be used by operators choosing to comply
with Option 2 for calculating their fleet emission levels. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document fulfills that commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No equipment had been certified as of July 1, 1994. This notice therefore confirms that the default provisions of the
final rule that are designed to assure emissions reduction for the program shall be effective for the first two years
of the program, 1995 and 1996. Emission levels that are to be used in the event that no equipment is certified by July
1994 are set forth in the table provided at 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) of the regulations promulgated in the April
1993 final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the April 21, 1993 final rulemaking stated that EPA intended to publish in this notice a table indicating
required post-rebuild PM emission levels for all affected urban buses. EPA also stated that it would append its determination
regarding post-rebuild emission levels to the CFR as an appendix to part 85 subpart O (the subpart of the CFR containing
the urban bus retrofit/rebuild regulations). However, because no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994, the default
post-rebuild emission levels, which are already contained in the regulation, will apply. Thus, EPA believes that
there is no need to add an appendix to subpart O at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1996, EPA will review the retrofit/rebuild equipment certified by July 1, 1996 and publish the emission levels
which must be used by operators using Option 2 for calendar years 1997 and thereafter.

II. Review of Certified Equipment and Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994 as meeting the emissions and cost requirements for the urban
bus retrofit/rebuild program. Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(B)(5), operators choosing to
comply with Option 2 must use the PM levels specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild
PM level'' in the table provided at &sect;85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) for calculating the target level for their fleet
(TLF). The determination of whether to use the pre-rebuild emission level or the post-rebuild emission level must
be made in accordance with 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An urban bus operator choosing Option 2 must be able to demonstrate that its fleet level attained (FLA) is equal to or
less than its TLF. In general, an operator choosing Option 2 has the following strategies available to comply with
this requirement:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For 1979 through 1987 model year Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) 6V92TA engines, using the currently available
DDC Coach Upgrade Program (kit), discussed below, which brings these engines to a configuration certified for model
years 1988 or 1989; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Replacing engines in affected urban buses with 1994 or later model year engines certified under EPA's new engine
certification program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Retiring urban buses early (that is, retiring 1993 and earlier model year urban buses before they are 15 years old);
and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Using grandfathering provisions contained in 40 CFR 85.1403(d) if the fleet contains urban buses retrofit before
January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should be aware of the following important aspects of Option 2 during the first two years of this program.
First, operators with urban buses in their fleet having model year 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA engines must reduce
average fleet PM emissions during calendar years 1995 and 1996. This is because the calculations for the TLF assume
that engines of the 1984, 1985, and 1987 model years will be rebuilt in calendar years 1995 and 1996, and because the
post-rebuild PM level for the DDC 6V92TA engines of the specified model years have a default level (0.30 g/bhp-hr)
that is less that its pre-rebuild emissions level (0.50 g/bhp-hr). Therefore, for operators with urban buses in their
fleet having model year 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA engines, one or more of the above strategies must be used as necessary
to demonstrate that its FLA is equal to or less than its TLF. (The calculations for the TLF assume that urban buses with
engines of model year 1986 will not receive any rebuilds during calendar years 1995 or 1996. Therefore, for 1986 model
year engines the post-rebuild level is equal to the pre-rebuild level for calendar years 1995 and 1996.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in (2) above, for operators choosing Option 2 who have model 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA urban buses in their
fleet, use of the DDC upgrade kit is an available, but not required strategy to meet the fleet average reductions required
under Option 2. DDC's upgrade kit will provide additional flexibility to fleets having the above-mentioned DDC engines
without necessitating use of the other, perhaps less desirable, strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the table of 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A), the post-rebuild level is lower than the pre-rebuild level for the 1979
through 1987 6V92TA engines because there is a currently available upgrade kit that is supported by new engine certification
data on file with EPA. At the time of the final rulemaking, EPA expected that DDC's Coach Upgrade kit would be certified
by July 1, 1994 under the retrofit/rebuild program for less than the appropriate cost ceiling. While as of July 1, 1994,
the Coach Upgrade kit had not been certified under the retrofit/rebuild program, EPA believes that it is reasonable
to provide a lower post-rebuild emission level to any applicable engine equipped with this DDC upgrade kit because
of the existence of new engine certification data which shows that engines virtually identical to the upgraded engines
were certified by EPA to the lower emission level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA originally intended that the ``Post-rebuild level'' specified in the table of 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A)
for the 1979 through 1987 model year 6V92TA engines to reflect the level attained when those engines are upgraded to
their latest certified, mechanically-controlled configuration (1988 or 1989 model year configuration depending
upon horsepower). After the final rule was published, it was discovered that the 1988 and 1989 model year 6V92TA engines
were certified to 0.31 g/bhp-hr under the new engine certification program, and not 0.30 g/bhp-hr as shown in the table.
Therefore, 0.31 g/bhp-hr is the level actually achieved by upgrading the 1979 through 1987 model year 6V92TA engines
to the 1988 or 1989 configuration that is certified under EPA's new engine certification program. Because of the error
in the final regulations, EPA will allow urban bus operators to claim a reduction down to the 0.30 g/bhp-hr level when
these engines are upgraded to the appropriate 1988 or 1989 configuration using the DDC Coach Upgrade kit. This will
allow urban bus operators to upgrade their engines as one method of complying with Option 2, as was EPA's original intention.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``grandfathering'' provisions of &sect;85.1403(d)(3) allow operators having urban buses equipped with upgrade
kits installed prior to January 1, 1995 to assume that such urban buses are operating at the PM level of the upgraded
engine configuration. Further, EPA believes it is reasonable to extend the ``grandfathering'' provisions beyond
January 1, 1995 for use of the DDC upgrade kit until appropriate equipment is certified, as discussed below, for the
DDC 6V92TA engines. Operators, however, should note that ``grandfathering'' provisions do not require either the
emissions defect or emissions performance warranties which are required of certified equipment under &sect;85.1409
of the program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, permission to retrofit/rebuild with uncertified equipment to meet program requirements applies to a limited
population of engines (that is, the 1979 through 1989 model year 6V92TA engines having mechanical fuel injection)
for a limited time frame (the 1995 and 1996 calendar years). If equipment is certified for the above-referenced DDC
engines as achieving the required PM emission reductions for less than the applicable cost ceiling before July 1,
1996, operators will not be able to claim emission reductions for engines rebuilt after calendar years 1995 and 1996
using uncertified equipment. Operators will be able to continue to claim emission reductions for engines which are
rebuilt with the uncertified DDC upgrade kit prior to that time.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces the deletion of the Revere Textile Prints Corporation Superfund
Site in Sterling, Connecticut from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is Appendix B of the National Oil and
Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of Connecticut
have determined that all appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented and that no further
response is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of Connecticut have determined that remedial actions conducted
under CERCLA at the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

 On November 10, 1993, EPA published a TSCA section 4 final test rule requiring testing of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene
(TMB) (CAS No. 108&hyph;67&hyph;8). After EPA published the final rule, certain manufacturers questioned the scope
of the manufacturers, importers, and processors subject to the test rule. EPA is now clarifying that only manufacturers,
importers, and processors of TMB as an isolated product, and not persons who manufacture, import, or process the substance
as part of complex mixtures or substances, are subject to the final test rule requiring certain health effects testing.

repeated dose and oral 90&hyph;day subchronic toxicity studies on TMB (58 FR 59667). In the preamble to the final rule,
EPA responded to a comment from a manufacturer concerned that the proposed testing program for TMB would cause substantial
economic impact for its company that would likely force it to discontinue sales of this chemical in the United States.
EPA stated in response that the impact will be less than originally noted in the proposal because the cost of the testing
program required by the final rule is less than the testing program proposed originally. In addition, EPA noted that
it believed that the commenter would not be the only company required to test because there are other manufacturers
that might be subject to the test rule, including ``several manufacturers of C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, which contain
1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers of the C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum refiners, challenged EPA's final rule arguing that they
had received inadequate notice that they might be subject to the test rule. After reviewing the record, EPA agrees
that there is some question whether these manufacturers received sufficient notice that they would be subject to
the test rule. As a result, EPA is issuing this Notice to clarify that only manufacturers, importers, and processors
of TMB as an isolated product, and not persons who manufacture, import, or process the substance as part of complex
mixtures or substances, are subject to the final test rule requiring certain health effects testing. This then leaves
open the issue of whether the testing requirements would, if fulfilled, cause the original commenter to suffer a substantial
economic impact. EPA has revisited this issue with the commenter and has been advised that this issue is no longer of
concern because the company has received voluntary contributions to cover some of the testing costs (May 3, 1994 letter
from Koch Industries to EPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that public comment on this clarification is unnecessary because: (1) Nothing in the actual regulation
is being changed and this merely aids in interpretation of the regulation; and (2) to the extent that confusion has
mistakenly led some persons to believe that they are subject to the regulation, this provides relief from that perceived
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, for persons who manufacture, import, and process TMB as an isolated product, the test rule is valid and
applicable to them. EPA is now clarifying that persons, including relevant petroleum refiners, who do not manufacture,
import, or process TMB as an isolated product are not required to submit test data, letters of intent to test, applications
for exemptions, import certifications, or any other item that may be required pursuant to a final test rule under TSCA
section 4. Additionally, only exporters of TMB as an isolated product or as part of mixtures known to contain previously
isolated TMB are subject to the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements (40 CFR part 707).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL) is amending the Job Training Partnership
Act (JTPA) regulations to implement the Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 and related statutes. Through these
final regulations, the Department intends to direct the focus of JTPA training and employment programs on improving
the targeting of JTPA services to those facing serious barriers to employment, enhancing the quality of services
provided and program outcomes, strengthening fiscal and program accountability and the linkage between the services
provided and local labor market needs, and fostering a comprehensive and coherent system of human resource services.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 13, 1982, the President signed into law the Job Training Partnership Act, Public Law 97&hyph;300. The stated
purposes of the Act were ``to establish programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force,
and to afford job training to those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing serious barriers to
employment who are in special need of such training to obtain productive employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of the Act sets forth general requirements for programs, as well as some requirements for State and local operation
of programs. Title II provides requirements for State and local operation of adult and youth programs for the economically
disadvantaged. Title III of the Act provides for operation of State and substate programs of employment and training
assistance for dislocated workers. Title IV provides requirements for special programs for targeted groups, such
as Native Americans, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, and veterans, as well as for the Job Corps and other specialized
programs. Title V provides incentives to States to reduce welfare dependency and increase self-sufficiency for
absent parents of children receiving aid to families of dependent children and blind or disabled individuals receiving
supplemental security income under title XVI of the Social Security Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, among other things, implements statutory requirements under the Job Training Reform Amendments
of 1992 (JTPA Amendments), Public Law 102&hyph;367; the Nontraditional Employment for Women Act (NEW), Public Law
102&hyph;235; the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Defense Authorization Act), Public
Law 102&hyph;484; the Older Americans Act, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;171; the Clean Air Act, Public Law 101&hyph;549;
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Worker Security Act, title V of Public Law 103&hyph;182 and the Goals
2000: Educate America Act, Public Law 103&hyph;227. While the programs are modified pursuant to statutory amendments
and requirements, the delivery system for the JTPA programs under the final rule remains essentially the same as in
pre-Amendment regulations. It does not have the financial or other impact to make it a major rule and, therefore, the
preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is not necessary. See Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor (``DOL'' or ``the Department'') has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business
Administration, that pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the final rule would not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. No significant economic impact would be
imposed on such entities by the final rule.

The Department has conducted this rulemaking in an open and public manner. Since the enactment of the Amendments,
Department officials have responded to numerous invitations to discuss the Amendments with organizations interested
in the Amendments and proposed regulatory action. Additionally, a group of technical experts has offered suggestions
to the Department on the proposed areas for regulatory action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 10, 1992, the Department published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invited comments from interested parties regarding proposed or recommended regulatory actions to be taken by
the Department. 57 FR 41447. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 29, 1992, the Department published an interim final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, providing the opportunity for comment. 57 FR 62004. Amendments to the rule were published on June 3, 1993. 58 FR 31471.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 400 sets of comments were received in response to the interim final rule. Sources of comments by the close of the
comment period were as follows: Private industry councils (99); service delivery areas (72); service providers
(41); States (39); community-based organizations (33); public interest groups (31); State JTPA offices (28); private
contractors (14); State education agencies (10); Federal agencies (8); unions (7); private citizens (7); State
job training coordinating councils (6); members of Congress (2); and other sources (4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, on March 24, 1992, the Department published proposed rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance program under JTPA title III, providing the opportunity to comment.
57 FR 10232. Thirteen sets of comments were received from State, substate entities and other organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department fully considered these comments and other comments received in time to consider in the development
of this final regulation and addresses the issues they raised in the following discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, during the period of May through July, 1994, when this final rule was in development, the Department initiated
a Dialogue with the employment and training community and others interested in the JTPA title II program for the disadvantaged.
This Dialogue was initiated by a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice published on May 18, 1994, and consisted principally of a series of fifteen small group and town hall meetings
and a review of research on employment and training programs with a view to developing an action plan to improve title
II programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Approach to Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations continue to provide substantial responsibility and discretion to States and local areas in developing
policy and in implementing procedures for JTPA programs. Thus, in many instances in these final regulations, responsibility
for certain decisions is vested in the State and in the service delivery areas (SDA's) and substate grantees (SSG's).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has attempted in these final regulations to foster improved customer services by eliminating or reducing
unnecessary programmatic requirements wherever possible so that decisions on how to best serve JTPA customers will
be made, to the maximum extent possible, at the level of customer service and based upon customer need. For example,
some of the restrictions on the duration of certain activities, such as work experience and entry employment experience
where not specifically provided for in the Act, have been eliminated. Rather than Federal regulation, the needs of
the customer as determined in the assessment process and the intervention's likelihood of success in enhancing skills
and achieving long term employment will dictate how the program intervention will be designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This was also a theme from the title II Dialogue. Some of the principal themes suggested by the title II Dialogue were
the following: (1) Greater program flexibility with accountability, (2) Greater support for longer-term training
interventions, including approaches more customized to customer needs and better connections between training
and jobs, (3) Improved coordination at all levels but with special attention to coordination among federal agencies,
(4) Increased supportive services, (5) More streamlining of eligibility, and (6) Better access for community-based
organizations to JTPA planning and service delivery. To the extent permitted by the rulemaking process, the Department
considered the major themes from the Dialogue in this final rule. In several instances, there are changes in this final
rule that are consistent with the themes of the Dialogue. For example, as noted above, certain prior restrictions
have been eliminated; initial efforts to achieve greater coordination with the Departments of Education, Health
and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development are reflected in this final rule; the Department has attempted
to streamline the requirements for providing participants with financial assistance; and these final regulations
clarify that, as appropriate, the new eligibility provisions for youth are applied in the program under section 123
and title II-B. In addition, the Department will reexamine the Eligibility Documentation Technical Assistance
Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), these regulations are limited to those areas
which are specifically required by statute, identified by the Department or the public as necessary to provide guidance
and clarification, or essential to further the purposes of the Act. Additionally, the Department fully intends to
provide strong oversight and monitoring of JTPA programs in conjunction with strengthened State and local oversight
and monitoring. It is through the monitoring of the implementation of the Amendments and these regulations, rather
than through promulgation of prescriptive regulations, that the Department, working with the States and service
delivery and substate areas, will ensure effective program operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of all the consultations and comments the Department has received, about half expressed interest in having the Department
be more detailed in the regulations, and the other half indicated that the Department was being overly prescriptive
in the interim final rule and preferred that the Department provide minimal guidance. The Department reminds readers
of these regulations that the JTPA Amendments create more restrictive operational and programmatic requirements
in order to address a series of issues that had been identified in connection with JTPA. The Department has sought to
strike a balance in these final regulations in terms of guidance and prescriptiveness. In some regulatory areas,
such as some of the administrative requirements, the Department has carefully specified requirements to set a strong
foundation for program integrity so that in other regulatory areas, such as program design, there can be more flexibility
and emphasis on outcomes. Finally, the Department has sought to make these regulations sufficiently clear, so that
all parties with an interest in JTPA understand both the requirements and the areas of flexibility in the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is not a stand-alone document; the companion document is the JTPA, as amended. In several instances,
however, portions of the Act are repeated to make the final rule user-friendly and to facilitate its use as a reference
tool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 1992 JTPA Amendments, the Clean Air Act, section 4467 of the Defense Authorization Act and the NAFTA
Worker Security Act impacted on title III of JTPA. The final regulations in 20 CFR part 631 provide for limited revisions
to existing title III regulations as required by these statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were a number of comments on specific areas of performance standards and related reporting requirements. On
July 11, 1994, the Department published separately in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final performance standards for PY 1994 and PY 1995. The Department appreciates the issues raised by commenters
on the interim final regulations in the area of performance standards and has taken these comments into account in
developing the performance standards. In addition, on June 23, 1994 the Department issued Training and Employment
Information Notice 5&hyph;93, Change 1 with the revised reporting instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also plans to issue separately revisions to the regulations for title IV, part A, the Employment and
Training Programs for Native Americans and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers. When it does, the contents of the regulations
as reflected herein may change. The Department has issued revised regulations for title IV, part B, the Job Corps.
(58 FR 69098 (December 29, 1993)).

Format of These Final Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The structure, organization, and enumeration of the JTPA regulations have been revised to accommodate the Amendments.
Throughout this document, unless otherwise stated, ``JTPA'' or ``the Act'' refers to the Job Training Partnership
Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); ``Department'' or ``DOL'' refers to the U.S. Department of Labor; and ``Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of
the U.S. Department of Labor or the Secretary's designated representative(s). As used in these final regulations,
the term ``title'' refers to a title of the Job Training Partnership Act, unless the text specifically refers to another
statute. The terms ``section'', ``part'', and ``subpart'' refer to a section, part, and subpart, respectively,
of these final regulations, unless the text specifically refers to another document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified at PART 626_Introduction To The Regulations Under The Job Training Partnership Act, part 627 applies
to all programs under titles I, II, and III of the Act, except where noted, and part 628 generally applies to title II
programs. Parts 629 and 630 are reserved for future use. Part 631 continues to apply to title III programs and part 637
has been revised for the title V Jobs for Employable Dependent Individuals (JEDI) program. Therefore, various sections
that previously appeared in parts 627, 628, 629, and 630 have been redesignated to parts 627 and 628.

The interim final rule at &sect;626.5 added a significant number of definitions of terms used throughout the JTPA
and regulations. Definitions of the terms ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'', ``family'',
``family income'', ``obligations'', ``stand-in costs'', and ``vendor'' received the most comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Commercially available off-the-shelf training package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the outset, the wording of the term being defined is changed. In the interim final rule the term was ``commercially
available or off-the-shelf training packages;'' in the final rule, the word ``or'' is dropped so that the term being
defined reads ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages''. The reason for this change is that both
the Act and the definition require that a training package be both commercially available and available at off-the-shelf
prices. Practically, availability at off-the-shelf prices is subsumed within the broader concept of commercial
availability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters submitted comments on the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'',
contained in &sect;626.5. The basis of this definition is the definition of a commercial product found in part 15 of
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). First of all, the Department acknowledges that there is a degree of uncertainty
regarding which training packages and their providers fall within the meaning of commercially available off-the-shelf.
The term, as defined within &sect;626.5, relies generally upon whether the package is provided in a commercial market
in which it is available to the public. This was the origin of the language ``sold to the public'' and that related to
``catalogue or market prices''. These business concepts are indicators of the training package's availability
to the public, e.g., a catalogue available to the public or a public, advertised price shows that the entity is seeking
to engage in commerce. The Department believes that most parties understand the basic meaning of whether any package
is ``commercially available.'' Some related areas of the definition are discussed further below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second area of inquiry pertains to the contents of the package. The training will consist of classroom and related
practical instruction, which may include hands-on experience. It may consist of the development of occupational
or education-related skills. For example, a package may provide occupational training to a participant as a nurse
practitioner, as a maintenance mechanic, or in computer design, in heating, ventilation and air conditioning, or
may provide basic skills in reading and computation. The package may consist of a necessary assessment of interests,
aptitudes, and abilities, as well as counseling and guidance related to participant progress and employment prospects.
Such a training package will not normally consist of the kind of assistance typically provided within the meaning
of a JTPA supportive service, but may include fees, books and other materials needed for participation and completion
of the package. In other words, if an organization offers training to the general public which consists solely of a
practical training course in a particular occupation, it is that course, without any other placement or assessment
services, which may be purchased as a commercially available training package. On the other hand, if the organization
offers assessment or placement services to the public as part of its training course, those services will be a part
of the commercially available package. A key indicator, however, is whether the contents of the package are generally
available and generally the same for all participants, not just JTPA participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, commenters raised questions about the type of entity that might provide the commercially available package.
A variety of entities may be the source of a commercially available package; however, the characteristics of the package,
that is, whether they meet the tests of commercial availability at off-the-shelf prices, are more of an indicator
than the entity that provides it. Such entities may include those that provide computer-based instruction in a variety
of occupational and educational topical areas, or they may be public and private schools, academies or other entities
that offer training that is commercially available, as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that the phrase ``performance criteria'' be defined, and the definition now includes
language that addresses the reference to ``performance criteria''. ``Performance criteria'' may generally fall
into two or more areas that reflect the necessary components and features of the package that is to be delivered, such
as (1) grade requirements, knowledge, skills, and competencies which may be expected to be attained by students,
and (2) where appropriate, participant attainment as manifested by job placement. This latter component is contingent
upon whether the service is regularly offered and may be reasonably included in the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters were concerned with the requirement that the packages be unmodified. They indicated that, in many
instances, a commercially available training package may be modified to some degree to reflect the special needs
of the JTPA population, without changing its basic content. A strict reading of the regulation would prohibit contracting
for commercially available packages which are modified in any way, regardless of whether the package remains substantially
the same. In addition, this strict reading would prohibit the JTPA program from taking advantage of a discounted price
that might be offered in connection with multiple purchases of the package. The Department does not intend that a local
program be prohibited from purchasing a commercially available package at a discounted price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to respond to this comment, the Department further conforms the definition to the concepts in the FAR, and
the word ``unmodified'' is removed. This change recognizes that some modifications may be made to a package to meet
special JTPA requirements, just as a commercial entity would offer to other customers, while the package remains
substantially similar to that regularly offered. A test for whether the package remains substantially the same as
that regularly offered is whether the modification does not involve an increase in the catalogue price. An increase
in catalogue price would indicate that the package is not substantially the same. However, a price decrease due to
such things as volume discounts or good negotiating is not, in itself, indicative of a modified package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another test is whether the same training components continue to be offered in the package. A difference in the training
components would indicate that the package may not be substantially the same. All of these tests should be considered
in determining whether a training package meets the definition. Further, JTPA funds should not be used to make any
modification to a training package. Should training packages be modified in order to conform to JTPA requirements,
they may be considered commercially available off-the-shelf only if they comply with the remaining requirements
listed in the definition. Thus, while some modification is possible, the definition is not intended to include ``customized
training,'' training designed solely to meet the special needs of an individual or group of JTPA participants.

A few commenters asked for a definition of ``substantial'' in regard to the quantities sold. In response, the phrase
``in substantial quantities'' is removed from the definition because the Department believes that the concept is
embodied in the idea of ``being sold to the general public'' which follows in the definition. For further guidance,
the FAR indicates, with respect to being sold in ``substantial quantities'', that ``[N]ominal quantities, such
as models, samples, prototypes, or experimental units, do not meet this requirement.'' Further, there were suggestions
that an amount such as 25 to 30 percent non JTPA sales may be useful to States and SDA's when setting policy in this area.
The definition that is provided conforms to the FAR definition; therefore, it is not being changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wondered if community-based organizations (CBO's) and non-profit organizations were included
within this definition. Such organizations may be among the types of organizations that provide a ``commercially
available off-the-shelf'' training package if the training packages they provide meet the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments reflected confusion about the relationship of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training
packages'' to ``vendors'' and ``subrecipients''. It is important to recognize that the definitions of ``vendor''
and ``subrecipient'' and the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'' exist for
different purposes and should not be viewed as related. An agreement to acquire a commercially available off-the-shelf
training package may create either a vendor or a subrecipient relationship, depending on the content of the package.
If the package contains elements that meet some of the distinguishing characteristics of a subrecipient (see definition),
then a subrecipient relationship is created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of whether a vendor or subrecipient relationship is created, the costs of the commercially available
off-the-shelf training package may be charged entirely to the direct training category. However, other JTPA requirements
such as record retention, audit, etc. do apply to a subrecipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages'' is to provide states
and SDA's broad flexibility to utilize generally available training services and to be able to charge those services
entirely to the training cost category. It will, for example, permit states and SDA's to purchase training from a variety
of educational institutions at off-the-shelf or catalogue prices. It must be recognized, however, that there are
limits to the flexibility that the definition affords. One important limitation is that the definition only applies
to the provision of actual training services to eligible JTPA participants. It does not apply to intermediate administrative
entities or entities that pass funds through to training providers. Another limitation is that the services must
actually be available to and provided to significant numbers of persons or to entities that procure training for such
persons under other state or federal programs outside the JTPA system. It will not be sufficient for a training provider
merely to claim that its services are available to the general public or to other training programs (like the JOBS program).
The state or SDA must be able to show that the services actually are available to the public or to other programs and that
the services are utilized by them. If a training provider has a history of providing training only to the JTPA program
or to JTPA participants, it will not be considered a provider of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training
packages''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not a part of the definition, section 141(d)(3)(A) of the Act also requires that ``commercially available
off the shelf training packages'' be purchased competitively. The requirements for competitive procurement are
covered in the procurement provisions of the regulations at &sect;627.420.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received on the definition of the term ``family'' at &sect;626.5 of the interim final regulations.
In general, the nature of these comments was that: (1) The definition is too restrictive and limits the Governor's
flexibility in defining the term; (2) the definition does not recognize alternative living arrangements that do
not fit neatly into the ``traditional'' concept of a family; and (3) the regulations do not address how to handle other
family members, including dependent adults, living in the same residence. A few of the commenters noted that an apparent
conflict exists in how ``family'' is defined in the interim final regulations and how it is treated in the Standardized
Program Information Report (SPIR) instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``family'' was statutorily defined in the 1992 Amendments for the purposes of income eligibility determination
for receipt of JTPA services. The interim final regulations provide the Governor with flexibility to interpret the
term ``family'' concerning how ``dependent children'' are defined for JTPA programs. The interim final rule also
defines the phrase ``living in a single residence''. The statute established a standard definition to apply consistently
for JTPA programs, which, within the three categories, covers the vast majority of family configurations and living
relationships in the country. The definition is not intended to address every possible permutation of alternative
living arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department believes that the regulations provide the Governor with some latitude in defining the term
``family'', the comments raised an issue regarding the adverse effect of excluding ``dependent adults'' from the
definition, which warrants further consideration. While the Department recognizes that excluding dependent adults
may impact on the eligibility of some family members, the Department does not believe that this circumstance is included
in the statutory definition. The Department does not believe that it has the authority to expand upon the definition
of ``family'' beyond the categories specifically found at section 4 of the Act. No change is made in the final regulations.
Other individuals living in the same residence, who are not dependent children, would be viewed as individuals in
applying for and being determined eligible to receive JTPA services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few of the commenters accurately noted the difference between the definition of ``family'' in the interim final
regulations and the SPIR instructions regarding the treatment of an individual with a disability for the purposes
of eligibility determinations. The SPIR reflects the definition of ``family'' in the regulations in effect prior
to the publication of the December 29, 1992, interim final rule. The definition contained in the interim final regulations
indicate that an individual with a disability ``may'', for the purpose of income eligibility, be considered to be
an unrelated individual who is a family unit of one. This change was an administrative error and should not have been
included in the interim final rule. Accordingly, the definition of ``family'' is amended to revise the word ``may''
to ``shall'' in the final regulations. This amendment is consistent with the provisions at section 4(8) of the Act
defining the term ``economically disadvantaged''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Family Income
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few comments were received on the change in the definition of ``family income'' and the method for calculating such
income for the purposes of determining eligibility for JTPA services. In general, the nature of the comments were
that: (1) The use of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) poverty guidelines appears to conflict with
the definition of ``economically disadvantaged'' at section 4(8) of the Act; (2) the definition does not include
certain payments that have previously been excluded from family income; and (3) the old definition of ``family income''
should be retained, with the Governor defining the term for the purposes of income eligibility determinations, as
has been the case since the inception of JTPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters accurately noted that certain payments that have always been considered to be ``public assistance''
were omitted from the interim final rule. This was an inadvertent oversight in developing the regulations. The definition
of ``family income'' is amended in the final rule to reflect that ``public assistance'' still includes Aid to Families
with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income, Emergency Assistance money payments, and non-Federal
funded General Assistance or General Relief money payments, which are exclusions from income for the purposes of
income eligibility determinations. In addition, certain other Federal statutes exclude additional types of payments
from JTPA income eligibility determinations. For example, Pell grants are specifically excluded by title IV of the
Higher Education Act, as is income earned while on active military duty and certain other veterans' benefits, identified
at 38 U.S.C. 4213. These exclusions are incorporated into the final rule. There also has been concern expressed regarding
the inclusion of Social Security benefit payments as income in determining eligibility for older individuals. It
has been noted that many older individuals fall just above the income threshold for JTPA because of the inclusion of
Social Security benefits and, therefore, are being denied needed JTPA services. The Department recognizes that
older individuals have special needs which warrant consideration for their participation and inclusion in programs
under JTPA. In the interest of responding to such needs, the Department is amending the regulations in the final rule
to permit the Governor to exclude 25 percent of regular Social Security benefits from family income. The Department
believes that this change will address the concerns of the commenters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters raised the issue that the HHS guidelines include scholarships as income. They expressed concern
that individuals who may receive scholarship assistance based on need, but who are otherwise economically disadvantaged,
would not be eligible for services if such assistance is counted as family income. In addition, they pointed out that
the inclusion of such needs-based assistance would also impact the eligibility of another family member who would
otherwise be eligible for services, regardless of whether the individual receiving such assistance applies for
JTPA services. The Department finds merit in the comments and is amending the definition of ``family income'' to add
``needs-based scholarship assistance'' to the exclusions from family income. To the extent that existing guidance
has been interpreted to require the inclusion of needs-based scholarship assistance as family income, these regulations
supersede any such guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few of the commenters noted that the interim final rule appeared to indicate that only use of the poverty level applied
in determining eligibility. This conflicts with section 4(8) of the Act, which indicates the use of the higher of the
poverty level or 70 percent of the Lower Living Standard Income Level in determining economically disadvantaged
status. The Department acknowledges that the preamble language could be misinterpreted. The reference to the use
of the HHS poverty guidelines as the standard for determining economic disadvantage pertained to the use of the HHS
guidelines to define family income, and not to indicate requirements different from those found at section 4(8) of
the Act. The HHS guidelines, with the exceptions noted in the definition of family income, would be used to determine
income, and that income figure would apply for the purposes of income eligibility determinations under section 4(8)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the several comments received on the term ``obligations'', most commenters were satisfied with the definition
and asked that it not be changed. A few commenters wanted it changed as they believed that, as defined, very little,
if any, funds would be reallotted or reallocated. No change is made to the definition, but the issue of reallotment
is further treated in the discussion of &sect;627.410. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter pointed out that the term ``service provider'' was defined by statute in section 301(b)(3) of the Act.
The definition in these regulations is amended to conform to the statutory definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``stand-in costs'' is revised, along with the regulation at &sect;627.480(f) (which had been paragraph
(g) in the interim final regulation), so that both provide the same criteria as to the time when such costs were incurred
and the cost category to which they are chargeable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other comments were received on the definition of ``vendor'', most of which generally fell into two groups.
One group encouraged referencing the definition of this term contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. The other group requested more clarification or examples. A few commenters
raised questions of whether vendor goods or services could be customized, or the extent to which they could be altered,
and still meet the vendor definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is applying the standard Federal Government-wide description of the term ``vendor'', as it already
exists in the audit requirements and related literature of OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. However, A&hyph;128
does not contain a definition of the term ``vendor'' and the A&hyph;133 definition appears to limit the term to providers
of administrative goods and services. For those reasons, and, as explained in the preamble to the interim final rule,
the Department draws upon the Questions and Answers developed by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency
(PCIE) and OMB for its definition. The PCIE document carries the vendor definition beyond administrative goods and
services and provides examples.

With regard to the question on whether vendor goods or services could be customized or modified, the Department believes
that the package may be modified to meet JTPA requirements if the vendor modifies its goods or services for other customers
and if it remains substantially the same as those goods or services regularly offered. An indication of whether vendor
goods or services are substantially the same as those regularly offered is whether the price does not increase when
it is modified. No change is made to the definition in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``published'' is removed in the final rule and the word ``issued'' is substituted. Also, language is added
to indicate that such guidelines, interpretations, and definitions adopted by the Governor are to be those that actually
have been imposed or utilized, consistent with section 124 of the Act. The word ``issued'' is used to better reflect
the purpose of the requirement that the guidelines, interpretations and definitions on which the Governor relies
are to be made public prior to their effective date and to assure that they are actually being used in the administration
of the JTPA programs. How the Governor chooses to inform the public may vary and may depend upon the nature of the action.
It may include means such as issuance of written directives or letters, inclusion in an electronic network or bulletin
board, publishing in a newspaper, or other public announcement in which the effective date is indicated.

Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim final rule, the Department requested comments on the feasibility of authorizing waivers to the JTPA
regulatory requirements. Recently, it has been suggested that some of the administrative burden or unintended effect
of regulatory requirements may be reduced through the granting of waivers_specifically waivers of regulatory requirements.
This was recommended in the recent report of the National Performance Review, ``Creating a Government That Works
Better and Costs Less.'' The Department believes that there is merit in this concept and incorporates a waiver provision
in these regulations. Therefore, a new &sect;627.201 is added which permits the Governor to request, and the Secretary
to approve, waivers of the regulations for up to four years. The request from the Governor must be consistent with the
provisions of the Act and demonstrate how the waiver will meet one of the criteria listed in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absent specific statutory authorization, the Secretary has no authority to waive statutory requirements. The Secretary
may, however, waive provisions of the regulations which expand upon, interpret or explicate statutory requirements.
The new regulation is intended to permit waivers of any regulatory provision as long as the waiver does not affect the
basic statutory requirements and if it is shown that the waiver will improve services, increase skill or educational
attainment, promote coordination or substantially improve the job placement outcomes of the JTPA program. For example,
a State may seek a waiver of the 25% disregard for social security income for older workers since that rule is not mandated
by the Act. To obtain such a waiver, a state would have to demonstrate that it would not reduce services to those most
in need. On the other hand, a state could not obtain a waiver of the regulatory prohibition on using JTPA funds to support
employment generating activities since that regulation simply repeats a clear statutory requirement. In a more
complicated situation, a state could request a waiver of some of the detailed requirements of the procurement regulation
(&sect;617.420) if those requirements conflicted with its own procurement system. In order to obtain such a waiver,
however, the state would have to show that its system adequately addresses all of the minimum requirements listed
in section 164(a)(3) of the Act and that it would promote coordination with other programs or would result in either
better quality services or better employment outcomes if the same procurement system were used by those programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department assumes that the States and SDA's/SSG's are more aware than is DOL of what waivers they may need. Thus,
the Department does not intend to provide immediate general guidance on what waivers may or may not be requested. As
the Department determines which waiver requests it will grant and which waivers lead to greater coordination or better
program results, guidance will be issued to enable the JTPA system to better understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver process and to learn about what practices work.

The JTPA Amendments amended section 167 of the Act to require that the Secretary issue final regulations which would
clarify the application of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of the JTPA and provide uniform
procedures for implementing these provisions. On January 15, 1993, the Directorate of Civil Rights (the DOL agency
responsible for enforcing the various Federal nondiscrimination and equal opportunity statutes applicable to
federally assisted programs) promulgated a final rule to implement the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity
requirements of the JTPA (29 CFR part 34; 58 FR 4742). Throughout these final regulations, all of the Department's
nondiscrimination and equal opportunity regulations (29 CFR parts 31, 32, and 34) are cited since they are all applicable
to JTPA federally assisted programs. In order to eliminate the burden of complying with overlapping regulatory requirements,
29 CFR part 34 provides that compliance by JTPA recipients with part 34 constitutes compliance with the Department's
Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VI regulations (29 CFR part 31) and with specified portions of the Department's Rehabilitation
Act section 504 federally assisted program regulations. 29 CFR part 32, subparts A, C, and E.

A few commenters, in connection with &sect;627.210(a)(3), questioned the cost category to which expenses for ``accessibility''

Cost classification. In addition, a commenter noted that this provision of the regulations should not be construed
to otherwise relieve a recipient or subrecipient from their responsibility under the law to provide for ``accessibility
and ``reasonable accommodation''. The Department agrees and the final rule is modified to indicate that the provision
applies only with regard to needs for the JTPA program.

Section 141(c) of the Act was revised substantially to prohibit the use, or proposal for use, of JTPA funds to induce
or to encourage the relocation of a company when such relocation results in the loss of employment of any employee of
the company at the original site. That section also prohibits certain assistance to any relocating company for the
first 120 days after the company commences operations at the new or expanded location, if the relocation results in
an employee's job loss at the original site. If the Secretary finds that the State, SDA, or substate grantee (SSG) has
violated either provision, fines are levied equal to twice the amount of funds expended. If the State, SDA, or SSG demonstrates
that it neither knew nor reasonably could have known (after an inquiry undertaken with due diligence) that the funds
it provided were expended in violation of these provisions, then only the amount expended is repaid.

Some commenters questioned whether these provisions prevent SDA's/SSG's from placing participants in certain
job openings for a set period of time. The Department believes that they do under circumstances in which there are job
losses in other geographic areas or in which workers are laid off or experience periods of unemployment. By clarifying
and standardizing terms, as well as setting the prohibition on assistance at 120 days, the Act systematizes the administration
of this prohibition on relocation. Most of the comments on the interim final rule pertaining to these provisions focused
on the need for clarification of terms such as ``labor market area'', ``loss of employment'', ``commercial operations'',
``pre-award review'', ``induce'' or ``encourage'', and on the extent of an SDA's due diligence and local liability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.215(c) defines a ``relocating establishment'' as a business entity moving operations ``from a facility
in one labor market area within the United States and its territories to a new or expanding facility in another labor
market area.'' Commenters pointed out that some rural labor market areas may encompass vast areas and several counties.
Section 4(13) of the Act provides a definition of ``labor market area'' as ``an economically integrated geographic
area within which individuals can reside and find employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change employment
without changing their place of residence. Such areas shall be identified in accordance with criteria used by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor in defining such areas or similar criteria established by a Governor.''
The key to the Act's definition is that the labor market area be ``an economically integrated geographic area'' where
an individual can change his or her employment without changing his or her place of residence. Thus, for purposes of
this relocation provision, a large rural SDA could contain more than one labor market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked for a clarification of ``loss of employment''. One stated that when employees at the original
location do not accept relocation job offers and then are laid off, ``loss of employment'' has not occurred. The Department
believes that, in such a situation, loss of employment is presumed when a person no longer has a job with the company
at the original location or with any other entity because of the relocation and the loss of employment at that location
would not otherwise have occurred. This does not include those who would have retired or quit regardless of the relocation,
or those who were fired for cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested further guidance on commencement (or expansion) of commercial operations. The Department
added the term ``commercial'' to the regulations to be consistent with the statutory intent that a viable prohibition
on JTPA assistance in the day-to-day production of goods and services be observed. The term ``commercial'' operations
is intended to further distinguish between the construction and operation stage of a business, as well as to demarcate
the stage when products are being produced for commercial distribution.

Similarly, a number of commenters asked whether ongoing JTPA contracts with a company must be stopped or interrupted
when the company relocates work from another facility. The Department believes any such contracts with the business
within the SDA to which the company has relocated must be ended for the duration of the time work is being relocated,
since ongoing JTPA assistance was not meant to accommodate business needs which are the result of work relocation
from another facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional clarification was also requested on the treatment of relocation scenarios where large retail store chains
close down some sites sequentially and then open others in widely dispersed locations. The Department believes that
the Act only applies to such cases where a company closes a retail store in one location in order to move that retail store's
business to another location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.215(d) requires a pre-award review to be completed to document compliance with section 141(c) of the
Act. Several commenters asked for clarification, and one recommended that the States be responsible for developing
the standardized pre-award format. Others voiced concern about whether SDA's should be held liable if relocation
occurred despite pre-award assurances to the contrary; several stated that a properly completed pre-award review
should prove due diligence on the part of the SDA and that sanctions otherwise are unduly harsh. The Department believes
that these reviews are for the protection of the State and the SDA/SSG. Section 627.215(d) is revised to provide additional
guidance for States and SDA's in developing standardized pre-award review procedures and to indicate items which
should be included in a review. Information should include the names under which the facility does business, including
successors-in-interest, the name, title, and address of the employer supplying the information; the name and address
of the facility in the other geographic area which is being closed or from which business is being transferred; the
nature of the products or business being transferred to the new location; the date the facility will commence or expand
operations; and a statement from the employer about job losses at the old location. The SDA also should check with the
former location to verify the employer's statements about job loss. The Department believes that a review based upon
the suggestions in the regulations is evidence of due diligence, but does not hold the SDA harmless when it is subsequently
shown that the statute was violated because the Act provides that the Secretary shall require repayment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that assistance to relocating businesses is not an entitlement. Once the State complies with
the minimum requirements set out in these regulations, it may be more restrictive in its assessment of the company's
situation or its determination of policy regarding relocating employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stressed the importance of monitoring to ensure the use of consistent pre-award reviews and also recommended
that the SDA/SSG consult with all affected parties, including union representatives at the original and relocated
site if relocation is indicated and JTPA assistance is sought. Although not required by the regulations, the State
should consider incorporating such procedures in its guidelines for the pre-award review. Before engaging in negotiations
with any company interested in moving to the area which seeks future JTPA assistance, the SDA/SSG should initiate
a pre-award review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a few commenters asked what constituted ``inducement'' or ``encouragement'' to a company to relocate.
The Act provides that ``[N]o funds provided under this Act shall be used or proposed for use to encourage or induce the
relocation, of an establishment or a part thereof, that results in a loss of employment for any employee of such establishment
at the original location.'' Thus, JTPA funds cannot be used in any manner for this purpose. Similarly, JTPA funds cannot
be used under the prohibitions concerning employment generating activities (Section 141(q)). One commenter asked
whether written material containing a general description of JTPA programs could be distributed to the local Chamber
of Commerce. The Department does not believe that providing material to a Chamber of Commerce which provides a general
description of JTPA programs would fall within the prohibition of the Act unless the purpose of the material were to
induce or encourage relocation. This regulation is not intended to affect what the Chamber of Commerce does, as long
as JTPA funds are not used.

Section 627.220 clarifies the interpretation of sections 107(b) and 141(b) of the Act. This section also highlights
the importance of coordination with programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA),
in view of the new coordination provisions at sections 205 and 265 of the Act, which require SDA's to enhance the provision
of services through coordination with other programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of coordination requirements is to preclude duplicate or overlapping payments among Federal, State,
and local programs to participants and training institutions and to ensure that the best mix of programs and funds
is available to the JTPA participant. Accordingly, &sect;627.220 assigns responsibility to the SDA's to coordinate
the sharing of information that affects JTPA-funded programs with the school's financial aid officer, provides
for contractual safeguards to prevent duplication or overlap of services and funding among programs, and emphasizes
the requirement for assessing the JTPA participant's financial needs and available resources as part of the individual
service strategy (ISS). These matters will also be addressed through technical assistance and guidance jointly
developed between DOL and U.S. Department of Education officials in order to guide both systems in the development
of constructive working relationships.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were submitted on a number of issues addressed in this section. The issue of whether JTPA funds should pay
for tuition or supportive services in coordination with other payment programs was raised by some who recommended
that clearer instructions be provided. The exact mix of funds should be determined according to the availability
of each funding source for either training costs or supportive services, with the goal of making the program affordable
and enabling the participant to successfully complete it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters were concerned about the complexity of procedures needed to ensure compliance with sections
107(b) and 141(b) of the Act. The Department agrees with the need to streamline procedures. Accordingly, &sect;627.220
is revised to reflect the following changes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.220(b)(2) is deleted, and &sect;627.220(b)(1) now directs the SDA to assist the participant early in
the objective assessment, as appropriate, to establish eligibility for HEA, title IV financial assistance programs.
In addition, &sect;627.220(b)(4) now emphasizes that participants may, but are not required to, apply for or access
student loans or incur personal debt as a condition of JTPA participation. While the use of student loans to finance
training or education is not prohibited and may be explored in the assessment process, loans should only be used if
the participant agrees and is made fully aware of the responsibilities that the loan entails. Participation in a JTPA
program may not be conditioned on applying for or using a loan. Finally, &sect;627.220(b)(4) clarifies the need for
information sharing which must take place for any financial aid awarded after the participant enrolls in an agreed-upon
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion of HEA student assistance programs in this provision raised a concern that title II participants may
be required to access loans. The Department wishes to stress that this is not the case. Section 627.220(b)(4) emphasizes
the importance of matching the participant with an affordable program. As a general consideration, individuals
should not be required to incur debts as a condition of participating in JTPA programs. Indeed, better identification
and coordination of funding sources and improved evaluation of the participant's ability to complete a program successfully
as part of the ISS should address the need for personal indebtedness to finance JTPA participation. Thus, &sect;627.220(a)
should not be construed to mean that loans must be considered resources for the purposes of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for including HEA, title IV student loans in the information-sharing requirements is that in the past,
some JTPA participants have been required or encouraged to take out loans to pay for their training without the knowledge
of the SDA's. However, the new requirements for objective assessments and developing ISS's for participants mean
that SDA's must take responsibility for evaluating and documenting the participant's financial needs and coordinated
ability to pay for an agreed-upon training program before he/she enrolls in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, several commenters stressed the importance of evaluating all potential HEA funding sources as part of the
development of the ISS and that these funding sources be identified and applied for while the ISS is being developed.
See &sect;627.220(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since federal Pell Grant eligibility can be established before a student enrolls and a Pell Grant can be used at any
participating institution that an eligible student attends, SDA's and SSG's should expedite the application process
by providing application forms to individuals and providing assistance, as necessary, in filling out and submitting
these forms. Although a few commenters were concerned that undue delays in the provision of services might result,
it is important to note that Pell Grant eligibility guidelines are readily available, as is the application form for
establishing eligibility, and the financial information required to complete the application is already required
to ascertain eligibility for JTPA programs. Furthermore, the Department of Education makes funds available to participating
schools before the start of the school year to pay eligible students. These funds can be accessed as soon as eligibility
is documented, the cost of attendance (COA) is calculated, and enrollment occurs. Although a few commenters suggested
that establishing Pell Grant eligibility might represent an administrative burden, the sequence described herein
in fact streamlines the funding decision process for the JTPA delivery system and permits coordination of funding
sources in the context of the ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments questioned a perceived inconsistency between Department of Education and Department of Labor
guidance on whether HEA title IV or JTPA funds must be used first. The Department does not think there is any conflict
with Department of Education regulations with regard to coordinating with JTPA funding decisions for tuition payments
because of the flexibility in the use of the Pell Grant for tuition or other education related expenses. These JTPA
regulations only require that, when a Pell Grant is awarded to a JTPA participant, JTPA funds cannot be expended on
costs that already have been paid by federal Pell Grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned the need for including the participant's agreement to the disposition of the Pell Grant
in the contract with the school, since it is understood that the participant will sign off on the ISS, which includes
information to be shared. Another commenter raised the issue of the Privacy Act as a reason why schools may not share
information regarding JTPA participants with SDA's. To clarify the issue of participant agreement, the final rule
includes the participant's agreement to the information-sharing process in &sect;627.220(c).

Strengthening monitoring provisions was the concern of a few commenters, who stated that requiring the school's
financial aid officer to share financial information on JTPA participants with the SDA is key to following up on the
participant's ISS and to coordinating JTPA funds with other sources of funding. The Department carefully considered
comments which called for reduced coordination requirements but believes that information sharing agreements
are necessary to ensure compliance with this section; however, the separate sharing of students' names may not be
necessary since JTPA agreements with training institutions will include the names of participants for whom payments
to the school are being made. Therefore, this requirement is removed from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters reported that schools are holding JTPA participants personally liable for payments withheld
in accordance with the terms of performance-based contracts. Performance-based contracts (or any other agreements
with service providers) must prohibit schools from holding the student liable for outstanding charges. Otherwise,
the performance-based contract would be undercut because the incentive for the school to perform would be removed.
This practice is prohibited by the U.S. Department of Education as described in the Federal Student Financial Aid
Handbook, Pell Grant Section. Therefore, JTPA program operators should be aware that the use of certain contracting
methods, particularly contracts for classroom-sized projects and fixed unit price, performance-based contracts,
affects how educational institutions are permitted to calculate the COA, which determines the amount of the participant's
Pell Grant. An institution can include a tuition and fee charge for calculating the federal Pell Grant COA only when
contracts or agreements specify the tuition and fees (i.e., individual referrals), when there is a charge recorded
to the student (when JTPA or another source pays the tuition and fee charge and the student would be required to pay these
charges if they were not paid by JTPA or another source). Two types of JTPA agreements do not allow schools to include
tuition and fees in the Pell COA or to make a charge to the student for these costs: (1) Blanket agreements that do not
specify an individual amount to be paid by the SDA for tuition and fees but may include a number of students to be trained
and an amount of compensation to be paid to the school; and (2) performance-based contracts (to the extent they are
still used).

addition, the prohibition of EGA should not be taken to prohibit ordinary employer outreach and job development activities.

Section 141(q) of the Act also includes a prohibition on foreign travel. A number of comments were received requesting
that the prohibition in the interim final regulations on using title I, II, or III funds for foreign travel be narrowed.
While the Department agrees that allowing foreign travel would be beneficial with the implementation of NAFTA, it
was clearly the intent of the Act to restrict the use of funds for economic development and related activities. However,
other foreign travel necessary to the conduct of JTPA program may be allowable; therefore, &sect;627.225(a) is revised
to clarify that the prohibition on foreign travel applies to economic development and related activities prohibited
by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter was concerned that a prohibition on foreign travel would prohibit staff from Territorial or Freely Associated
States recipients, such as American Samoa and Micronesia, from traveling to a State. While the narrower interpretation
of prohibited foreign travel described above should resolve this, the Department wants to clarify that, under section
4(22), such recipients are considered States for JTPA purposes and as such, inter-recipient travel would not be considered
foreign travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification about what cost categories the remaining allowable EGA should be charged.
To clarify, there are no allowable employment generating activities available under JTPA. The allowable activities
discussed in this section are otherwise authorized activities and should be charged to the category of benefit determined
with guidance provided by the Governor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.235 of the interim final rule sets forth some general program requirements for the JTPA program, including
specific reference to the provisions of sections 141, 142, and 143 of the Act, reference to the selective service requirements
of the Act, continuation of the requirement for timely enrollment, and the new requirements of section 124 of the Act
regarding the imposition of State and SDA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested setting forth extensive procedures regarding the appropriate consultation and concurrence
of organized labor. The Department believes that the provisions of the Act, though somewhat revised, are clear and
that in most instances SDA's and others have developed procedures for ensuring that labor is consulted, as appropriate,
in the development of training programs, and that the affected labor organization concurs in writing with training
agreements when there is a collective bargaining agreement, even if it is not impaired. In the years since the inception
of JTPA, this has not systematically emerged as an issue. Accordingly, the final rule is not changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the only aliens who should be eligible for JTPA participation are permanent resident
aliens. The commenter's reasoning is that to serve other aliens in the United States on a temporary basis would waste
scarce JTPA resources. The nondiscrimination provisions of section 167 of the Act set forth the requirements for
the participation of individuals who may not be citizens of the United States, including those who are not permanent
resident aliens. The final rule is not changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that this section be revised to indicate that JTPA is not an entitlement program. The Department
believes that the provisions of sections 204(c)(5), 264(d)(6) of the Act and &sect;628.525 of the interim final rule
adequately address this subject by making it clear that neither eligibility nor participation in a JTPA program creates
an entitlement to services. The final rule is not changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification of when the ``45-day clock'' in paragraph (c) begins for purposes of
enrollment into JTPA, particularly in light of the new program requirements for targeting and assessment. The Department
agrees that such guidance would be helpful and the final rule is changed to indicate that the clock begins with the date
of eligibility determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the requirements of paragraph (e), some commenters questioned the method for determining whether
a requirement which is a rule, regulation, policy, or performance standard is imposed by a State or an SDA. This question
is raised particularly when the Act or these regulations may require the Governor or SDA to develop such a requirement.
In general, any requirement that is issued beyond the actual text of the Act or these regulations should be identified
to the source (State or SDA) that issues it. This guidance applies only to requirements that are not specifically called
for (

SDA as used here includes any entity empowered to act for the SDA including the grant recipient, administrative entity
or the private industry council. See also the discussion of &sect;627.200 above. The final rule is changed to indicate
that it applies to State and SDA requirements that are in addition to those of the Act and regulations.

Section 627.240 of the interim final regulations sets out requirements pertaining to the on-the-job training (OJT)
activity authorized at sections 204(b), 253(a), 314(d) and in title IV of the Act. The interim final regulations dealt
with a few broad areas related to OJT, such as the duration of OJT, OJT payments, contracts for OJT, employer and participant
eligibility, as well as a definition of OJT. Many of the commenters observed that the requirements for OJT have become
so burdensome as to make OJT no longer a viable JTPA training option. The 1992 Amendments made a number of changes in
the requirements for OJT programs which are implemented in these regulations. These changes were aimed at eliminating
perceived abuses in OJT programs. While it is true that these new requirements do limit some flexibility in operating
OJT programs, the Department does not agree that the new requirements in any way make OJT a less desirable or feasible
training option. Indeed, the Department believes that OJT is an important training vehicle for the JTPA program.
As demonstrated by The National JTPA Study (December 1994) , OJT provided ``the most consistent positive program
impacts on the earnings of adults *&blank;*&blank;*. Both women and men in this subgroup enjoyed large positive earnings
gains that were statistically significant and sustained throughout the 30-month follow-up period.'' The Department
believes that entities which deliver OJT will find that these final regulations set forth only those requirements
which are necessary to preserve the integrity of the OJT activity and to ensure that it remains an effective training
tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the definition of OJT in paragraph (a), it is essential to recognize that by using OJT, the JTPA system
is purchasing occupational training needed by a participant_often training not elsewhere available, which is provided
through employment that will usually continue with the employer after the training is completed. (Note the provisions
of paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule regarding placement of OJT participants with other employers). The objective
of OJT is not, as suggested by some commenters, to subsidize wages or to reduce an employer's wage costs, but to purchase
training and to provide an opportunity for JTPA participants that they might not otherwise have. The contents of paragraph
(a) are reorganized into three subordinate paragraphs for better clarity. Language is added in a new paragraph (a)(1)
to clarify the definition of OJT by: (1) Making reference to the ISS as part of the process for determining whether an
individual should be offered OJT, (2) making specific reference to the OJT agreement, and (3) making specific reference
to the principle that the purpose of the OJT arrangement is to purchase training in exchange for reimbursement of the
employer's extraordinary costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By far the most prevalent comment on the interim final rule was that the Department needed to clarify the provisions
relating to the limitations on the duration of OJT which were contained in paragraph (b) of the interim final rule.
The final rule clarifies the durational rules for OJT. The basic rule is that OJT is to be for the length of time normally
needed for training to acquire the skills needed to perform the occupation up to a 6-month length of training. OJT may
not exceed that 6 month maximum training period except in cases in which the training is less than full time and the training
period will exceed 6 calendar months. In that case, OJT may not exceed 500 hours. To more clearly convey these rules,
paragraph (b)(1) is broken into four subordinate paragraphs. Paragraph (b) is also reordered for greater clarity.
Six months of training is defined as the amount of time an employee would work on a regular or full-time basis in the occupation
for which the OJT contract is written in a 6 month period. If the training period is shorter, the training time is still
considered to be the amount of time an employee would work on a regular or full-time basis for that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters observed that OJT contracts were usually written in terms of hours and wondered how this related to the
6-month limitation. The Department wishes to promote local discretion in developing OJT contracts; therefore,
the regulations do not prescribe a particular time category by which SDA's designate the 6-month period, so long as
the designation is consistent with the purpose of the statutory limitation. For example, the 6-month training period
may be expressed in the number of hours (usually not more than 1,040 working hours), days (180 days), or weeks (26 weeks
in 6 months) that an individual would work full-time in a 6-month period. Contracts for OJT which are expressed in any
of these ways will be acceptable. In simplest terms, an OJT employee who enters employment on May 1 and works continuously
on a full-time basis on the OJT occupation would complete 6 months of training on October 31. Whatever time category
the SDA chooses to use to designate the duration of the OJT contract, it should treat any adjustments (such as those
provided for in the discussion below) in the same terms, so if there is an adjustment for illness to a contract written
in working hours, the adjustment will be made in working hours, not weeks or days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the OJT period is interrupted for a full day or more by events beyond the OJT trainee's or the employer's control,
such as holidays, illness, plant downtime, or strike, such time may be added to the original period. Thus, using the
time period of the above example, if an OJT participant is in OJT to learn a machine operation but is ill for 10 working
days (approximately 80 working hours, two working weeks, or one-half of a working month) the OJT period may end approximately
November 11 through November 15 (instead of October 31) depending on how duration is designated in the contract. (The
employer would not be reimbursed for the period in which the participant is not in the OJT occupation.) The objective
of this rule is to assure that the participant receives the full period of training (up to 6 months) in the occupation
for which the OJT contract is written. This rule, of course, applies only to time that a participant was scheduled to
spend in the actual OJT activity. It does not apply to any of the participant's other activities, either in training
or outside of their OJT employment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed the concern that the regulations were too prescriptive in requiring OJT in higher skilled
occupations. The language of &sect;627.240(b)(2) of the interim final rule was merely intended to encourage the
use of OJT in higher skilled occupations. Language is added to the redesignated &sect;627.240(b)(5) to make this
clear. Other commenters were concerned that the 6-month limitation was inconsistent with providing training in
very high skilled occupations. The Department agrees that there are some higher skilled occupations for which OJT
training may not be available because of the 6-month limitation. Nevertheless, that limitation is statutory and
cannot be ignored. The Department believes that there are still a number of higher skilled occupations for which OJT
is appropriate and that it is consistent with both the nature of OJT and with the intent of the Act that States and SDA's
seek to use OJT to provide training in those kinds of occupations. Therefore, the language encouraging OJT in higher
skilled occupations remains in the final regulation. The Department wishes to acknowledge several comments by noting
that, while it encourages OJT in high-skilled occupations, this is not a strict requirement. Also, while OJT contracts
may recognize training times that are longer than 6 months, JTPA reimbursement to the employer is limited to 6 training
months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters wanted to know how the 500 hour exception to the 6-month limitation works. First of all, it should
be repeated that the overall limitation on the duration of OJT is 6 months, not 500 hours. This exception will apply
in only a limited number of situations, such as in the cases of individuals who are disabled, who have limited employment
availability due to child-care or other needs, or who must work a limited or part-time schedule. The final rule makes
it clear that individuals who have not received 500 hours of OJT within 6 months may receive 499 hours of OJT, even if
this results in OJT in excess of the 6-month duration. The 499 hour figure is used because it reflects the ``less than
500 hours'' language contained in the Act. For example, if an individual works for 15 hours a week and 6 months later
has only been in training for about 360 hours (roughly 60 hours a month for 6 months), the participant could be continued
in OJT for up to another 139 hours. The objective is to assure that participants who must work limited or part-time schedules
receive up to 499 hours of OJT, in situations when up to 499 hours of training is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a comment that the interim final rule unnecessarily requires that the regular training duration provided
for in a standard reference be reflected in the participant's ISS, the final rule provides that the training time for
OJT must be reflected in the ISS only when the training time varies from the average training time for the occupation,
using the methodology adopted for computing training time. Thus, when greater or lesser OJT periods than those provided
in standard reference works are necessary, the variation must be reflected in the participant's ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that the language in paragraph (c)(1) of the interim final rule regarding employer payments
is more restrictive than the provisions in the Act. In response to these comments, the final rule is revised to use the
language of the Act, which provides that payments shall not average more than 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer
to such participants. This change provides the SDA with some flexibility in structuring OJT contracts with an individual
employer for multiple participants. Compliance with the statutory requirement is based upon the total allowable
wage base (i.e., regular wages and scheduled increases reflected in the contract) for all JTPA participants. Additionally,
in response to comments which questioned the wage basis for OJT reimbursement, the final rule clarifies in paragraph
(c)(2)(ii), that OJT reimbursement may be based upon regular pay and scheduled increases, and not, as provided in
paragraph (c)(2)(iii), on overtime, shift differential or other premium pay. The Department believes that regular
pay and regular scheduled pay increases reflect the wages specified in the Act and that overtime and shift differential
do not imply a greater level of training cost to the employer. Finally, to clarify a longstanding issue in regard to
OJT, paragraph (c)(2)(iv) indicates that payments are not to be based on time when the participant is not in training
such as on holidays. Such time may also be excluded from the calculation of the duration of OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141(g)(1) of the Act provides that payments to employers ``are deemed to be'' in compensation for the extraordinary
costs associated with training JTPA participants. Section 141(g)(3)(A) of the Act provides that each contract ``specify
the types and duration of on-the-job training and other services to be provided in sufficient detail to allow for a
fair analysis of the reasonableness of proposed costs *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This latter requirement was reflected
in the interim final rule. Some commenters raised a question about the apparent conflict between these provisions,
and the Department wishes to clarify this area. The final rule prohibits the imposition of a requirement on employers
to document extraordinary costs. The Department believes that payments to employers should not produce a recordkeeping
burden on employers by requiring the documentation of extraordinary costs that would unnecessarily make OJT a less
desirable training option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of &sect;627.240(d)(1) of the interim final rule was to reflect the requirements of section 141(g)(3)
of the Act. It was not intended to require specific documentation of an employer's extraordinary costs. The Department
views the final rule as requiring no more recordkeeping of an employer than is already required of the employer for
other purposes, (e.g., an employer would have to maintain payroll records to demonstrate that a participant worked
the number of hours that were billed, but payroll records are already required to be kept for a variety of other federal
and state purposes). Rather, the Department believes that the intent of this requirement is that the contract accurately
reflect the basis for the contract costs, including the number of participants, occupations, wage rates, training
content and the duration of training, provisions for adjustment (such as scheduled wage increases), and the basis
for any other payments (such as separately scheduled classroom training as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this
section).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule is revised to clarify this requirement by removing the confusing language regarding the analysis of
the reasonableness of costs and by reflecting the minimum criteria that will be necessary to make the reasonableness
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) that the OJT agreement provide information
on the training by skill area or task was too prescriptive. These requirements have been removed in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in response to a comment seeking clarification of the meaning of ``types'' of OJT, this language is removed
in the final rule to eliminate confusion. The idea behind this language was simply to capture other kinds of training,
such as classroom training, that will be provided in the course of the OJT training period. The more specific language
in the final rule will capture the same information. Finally, this discussion does not affect the requirements for
broker contracts in which there is to be an adequate reflection of the work performed by the broker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.240(f) of the final rule provides that JTPA participants must be assessed and that OJT must be determined
in the ISS to be a suitable training vehicle. This provision is also applicable if the participant is referred to JTPA
by an employer. If the participant is determined not to be suitable for OJT or for the OJT slot available from the specific
employer, the participant is not eligible for OJT with that employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter sought clarification of &sect;627.240(f)(3) regarding OJT with a participant's previous employer,
particularly in connection with ``upgrading''. This paragraph is intended to address a perceived abuse of the OJT
activity in which the JTPA program provides OJT assistance to an employer to ``train'' a previous employee who had
been laid off or separated when the proposed participant already has the skills required for the job. The training
is in the same occupation for virtually or nearly the same work. In view of the limited availability of JTPA funds and
services, individuals previously employed by or recently hired by the employer prior to referral to JTPA should not
normally be enrolled in JTPA-funded OJT. In order to conduct skill ``upgrading'', which is allowable under section
204(b)(1)(L) of the Act, and retraining, conditions for eligibility and participation must be met and there must
be a demonstrable difference between the job and skill requirements of the upgraded job into which the participant
is being trained and those of the current or prior job. The prohibition against using OJT for ``upgrading'' with the
participant's employer is maintained in the final rule because the Department believes that the JTPA program should
not unnecessarily subsidize an employer's normal workforce training expenses. Paragraph (f)(3) is revised to eliminate
confusion about whether the rule was intended to address the participant's previous employer or the participant's
current employer. The final rule makes it clear that the prohibition applies to both and that it applies only to OJT.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters questioned the specific provisions of &sect;627.240(g)(1) of the interim final regulations which
require that an OJT ``employer who had two or more previous OJT contracts'' and exhibited a pattern of failing to provide
long term employment would be ineligible for other OJT contracts. They pointed out that it is not possible to establish
a ``pattern'' with two cases. In response to these comments, the final rule is revised to reflect Congress' intent
that employers who fail to offer continued employment, unless there is an acceptable reason, should not receive additional
OJT contracts and that the State must issue procedures to implement this requirement. The JTPA program should not
be used to underwrite an employer's labor turnover. The Department points out that the provision in the interim final
rule specified two contracts because, by definition, to have a pattern there must be more than one. The Department
accepts that there may be instances in which a policy may use as few as two contracts, or more than two, to establish a
pattern and will accept reasonable interpretations of what constitutes a pattern. The Department chooses not to
specify what constitutes a pattern and leaves that decision to the State. In the final rule, &sect;627.240(g) is redesignated
&sect;627.240(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters objected to the provisions in the interim final rule that required on-site monitoring of each
OJT contract and on-site monitoring by an OJT brokering contractor before making payments. The Department acknowledges
these concerns and revises these monitoring requirements. The final rule removes the prescriptive requirements
for monitoring each contract and specifies that recipients and subrecipients are required to conduct periodic on-site
monitoring of OJT employers. The requirements pertaining to the areas to be verified through monitoring remain the
same. In addition, the monitoring requirements for brokering OJT contractors remain the same since they are requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to several comments which argued in favor of providing OJT through employment agencies, the final rule
also provides a clarification of the conditions under which employment agencies and employee leasing agencies may
be eligible for OJT agreements. The purpose of OJT is to provide training through an employer, not to subsidize wages
or reduce agency costs. Thus, the final rule indicates that OJT agreements with employment and employee leasing agencies
are to specify the employer that provides the training and the entity to be reimbursed the costs of training. Note that
the word ``temporary'' is deleted from the rule since the term ``employment agency'' includes agencies that may arrange
employment on less than a full-time basis.

Work Experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of &sect;627.245 of the interim final rule set forth requirements pertaining to work experience.
The work experience activity is related to other activities in which there is work-based training, such as entry employment
experience and limited internships, but the activities may differ due to the circumstances of the work experience
assignment. Such circumstances could include whether the participant is an adult or a youth, whether the host employer
is public, private non-profit, or private for-profit, whether an employer-employee relationship is established,
and whether there is an expectation of continued employment, or whether the activity is a short-term training opportunity.
For example, entry employment experience and limited internship in the private sector are not allowable activities
for adults. ``Work experience'' is available only in the public or private non-profit sector. The Department acknowledges
the relationship among these activities but chooses not to provide specific definitions beyond that for work experience
so as not to arbitrarily limit development of types of work-based training activities. The Department wishes to encourage
a variety of approaches to these activities. For that reason, &sect;627.245(a) is revised by deleting the reference
to limited internships and entry employment experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of work experience clarifies that work experience is primarily a training, not an employment, assignment.
The words ``employing agency'' are removed from the interim final rule to address the concern that work experience
automatically establishes an employment relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted that the provisions of paragraph (b) of the interim final rule that dealt with the types of individuals
for which work experience would be ``suitable'' did not adequately reflect the circumstances under which it would
be appropriate to use work experience. The final rule is revised to delete this characterization of the individuals
for whom work experience is appropriate. The paragraph now only states how work experience is to be designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments criticizing the limitations on the duration of work experience, entry employment experience,
and limited internships, the Department has decided to remove the limitations. The Department believes that this
change will permit the development of activities that may better meet the individual needs of participants and the
final rule indicates that this should be reflected in the ISS. The Department expects that discrete periods of work
experience participation will be limited in duration; although, in response to comments and in recognition of successful
program models, the Department acknowledges that an individual may benefit from participation in multiple work
experience opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters asked for removal or revision of the provision that work experience is suitable for individuals who
have been ``out of the labor force for an extended period of time *&blank;*&blank;*.'' They pointed out that this is
difficult to interpret, may vary depending on the previous experience and other characteristics of the participant,
and is the kind of provision that could unnecessarily lead to varying interpretations and audit exceptions. The final
regulations provide only that work experience should promote the development of good work habits and basic work skills.
In addition, it is the Department's belief that the work experience activity provides an excellent opportunity to
provide non-traditional employment opportunities, in a variety of settings, for women and youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the prohibition of work experience in title III be removed or revised. Since title
III dislocated workers generally have, by definition, previous employment under which work habits and basic work
skills are developed, the provision in the interim final rule is not revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a few commenters asked for clarification of the requirement that work experience be combined with basic
or occupational skills training_particularly in light of one of the examples provided in &sect;628.535. This is
addressed in the discussion of &sect;628.535, but by way of general guidance, the prohibition may not be addressed
by combining work experience with any of the other proscribed stand-alone activities such as job search or job club.

Subpart C_Payments, Supportive Services, Benefits, and Working Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were received on Subpart C of the interim final rule, Payments, Benefits and Working Conditions.
The Department has rethought its positions in response to these comments and the final rule contains a considerable
number of changes. Subpart C is revised, retitled, and renumbered. The following discussion is intended to clarify
the Department's position on payments and supportive services and identifies the changes from the interim final
to the final regulations. In keeping with the Amendments' emphasis on targeting services to the hardest-to-serve
and the need for longer-term interventions, these regulations clarify the widened array of payments, supportive
services, benefits and working conditions available or required under the Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments provide for comprehensive supportive services and for their allocation to the training-related
and supportive service cost category. The regulations implement these provisions and also provide for clarification
of the various types of payments for title II programs. Some payments can be allocated to the training-related and
supportive services cost category while others can be allocated to the training cost category. The treatment of specific
expenditures is provided for at &sect;627.440 of these regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters expressed confusion regarding appropriate documentation procedures and requested clarification
on the requirements and the mechanisms for providing payments and supportive services to participants. Several
commenters suggested that while the legislation clearly intended to increase supportive services and payments,
the requirements in the interim final regulations would probably limit their usage. In response, the final rule is
revised to minimize the amount of documentation necessary to establish an individual's need for supportive services
and payments while maintaining the necessary safeguards to prevent misuse of program funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule is revised to permit a simplified service strategy. For example, under title II, it is intended that
a participant, based upon the needs identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS, will be provided
or the program will arrange for the necessary payments and supportive services to enable the participant to meet the
goals set out in the ISS. The necessary payments and supportive services may be provided or paid for in different ways.
For example, participants may receive a payment from a training activity, such as an employer-paid wage for OJT, or
work-based training payment for work experience which may be counted toward meeting their needs in addition to other
supportive services like child care. Participants may also receive supportive services, such as financial assistance
under title II that will provide for the participant's general welfare. If the participant has additional specific
needs not met by the supportive services, including a need for financial assistance, title II further provides for
an individually determined needs-based payment may be made to the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulation provides for significantly different documentation requirements than did the interim final
rule. An individual determination of need, over and above what normally occurs in the objective assessment and ISS,
is not required to justify the provision of any supportive service. When a participant is given money rather than a
voucher for a supportive service, SDA's and SSG's need not ensure that the payment is exactly equal to the participant's
expenditure. The policy of the SDA or SSG may allow for a fixed reimbursement or a schedule of different reimbursement
amounts for a type of service, however, the policy must provide the rationale for such amounts. Under title II, if the
objective assessment and the ISS indicate that a needs-based payment is also necessary, then that determination
will be sufficient to make the payment. A payment may then be made in accordance with a locally developed policy and
recorded in the ISS along with the other services provided. Changes to reflect this strategy are made throughout &sect;&sect;627.305
and 627.310 of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shifting to more specific recommendations, in response to comments that the supportive services section be separated
from the benefits and working conditions section, the supportive services regulations are now found under &sect;627.310,
while benefits and working conditions are now addressed under a new &sect;627.315. Section 627.300 and the title
of subpart C are also amended to clarify these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was received regarding the ability to ensure that services were provided equitably. This concern is heightened
with the reduction in documentation required when providing supportive services and payments. Therefore, a new
provision is added at &sect;&sect;627.305(a)(3) and 627.310(d) requiring that SDA's ensure, to the extent possible,
that similarly situated participants receive similar payments or supportive services, as appropriate.

Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested clarification on when payments shall count towards the determination of income for other
programs that serve JTPA participants. To clarify, language from section 142(b) of the Act is now included in &sect;627.305(a)(4).
Any payment under JTPA, broadly defined for this section as any JTPA funds received by a participant except OJT wages
(since OJT wages are paid by an employer), shall not be counted for purposes of determining income for other Federal
or federally assisted programs, except as provided under the Social Security Act. For example, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development has issued a policy notice (PIH 92&hyph;48, October 16, 1992) which states, ``[A]ll
payments received under programs funded in whole or part under the Job Training Partnership Act are excluded from
Annual Income'' for purposes of Public and Indian Housing. The major exception to disregarding JTPA income is under
title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act which governs Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The AFDC
regulations do allow States flexibility in allowing a dependent child's JTPA income to be disregarded as income for
AFDC purposes (45 CFR 233.20(a)(11)), but generally, any JTPA payment to an adult AFDC recipient, except to cover
the cost of child care, transportation, work-related expenses or work-related services, is counted as earned income.
States are encouraged to work with their welfare departments in developing State policies specifically for JTPA.
SDA's also are encouraged to coordinate with their local AFDC agency to determine local policies on income disregards
and to consider co-enrollment with JOBS, where appropriate, so that the participant may be aware of all available
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.305(a) is revised to include a new paragraph (a)(6) which authorizes SDA's to set fixed levels for payments.
Section 627.305(b) is amended by replacing the words ``formula or procedure'' with the word ``policy''. These changes
permit SDA's to make needs-related payments based on a payment schedule without any other documentation than that
used to develop or support the schedule. Only in cases in which a participant's needs exceed the payments available
under the payment schedule is any other documentation or justification necessary. The change in the wording of &sect;627.305(b)
also is intended to make it clear that there are no extraordinary documentation requirements to support the SDA's
system for payments above its payment schedule. All that is needed is a reasonable policy based on the circumstances
of the local community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Needs-based payments. Needs-based payments may be made in circumstances where fixed or scheduled supportive services
fail to meet the needs of an individual to participate. For example, if a standard transportation reimbursement is
$2 a day for participants, but a particular participant must spend $10 a day to commute to a training program, this need
would be identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS. Then a needs-based payment of $8 could be made
to meet that participant's transportation needs. No additional documentation other than the transportation need
identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS is required for the initial $2. However, a specific
notation of the additional need would be identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS for the $8 needs-based
payment. While this payment should be the amount ``necessary for participation,'' it also may be a scheduled or fixed
amount (see the discussion of supportive services, below, for an additional discussion on ``scheduled'' or ``fixed
amount''), as provided for in the SDA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incentive and bonus payments. A number of comments were received requesting that the ability to use incentive and
bonus payments not be limited to title II&hyph;C. Several commenters indicated they would prefer to use incentive
and bonus payments rather than a wage or training payment to encourage participant performance. Since it is important
to have tools to reward participant accomplishment, and incentive and bonus payments are not prohibited in those
titles, the final rule is amended to clarify that incentive and bonus payments also may be made to participants under
titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately equal numbers of comments were received requesting that &sect;627.305(c) require that incentive
and bonus payments be based upon attendance and performance as there were comments requesting attendance or performance.
Several commenters thought that teaching life skills, such as good attendance, is an appropriate function of JTPA
and should be rewardable. Because section 264(c)(2)(D) of the Act uses the word ``and'', the final regulation is revised
to reflect the statutory language. Payments are to be reasonable and commensurate with the behavior being rewarded.
The policy for such a payment is to be included in the SDA job training plan, which is approved by the Governor. The provisions
of paragraph (c) are amended in the final rule by removing paragraphs (c) (2) through (4), to reflect the simplification
of this topic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training payments. To permit longer term participation, &sect;627.305(d) provides for training payments to be
paid for certain title II activities, such as work experience and limited internships. Section 627.305(e) provides
for training payments for participation in other activities, such as classroom training, if the concurrent work-related
activity is for more than 50 percent of the training time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters indicated that the work-based training requirement for adults in classroom training combined
with work experience at interim final &sect;627.305(e)(2) may not always be appropriate and was redundant with regard
to the requirements of section 204(c)(1) of the Act on workplace context and integration. Therefore, the Department
encourages SDA's to link classroom training to the work-based training activity, but the condition for making such
payments to adults that the classroom training have a workplace context is removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``wage'' is replaced with ``training payment'' or ``training payment for combined activity'' to reflect
the rare circumstances when a participant may not be in an employee-employer relationship as defined by the Internal
Revenue Service, and also to make clear that the SDA may not be required to make a payment equal to the minimum wage. The
minimum wage requirement still exists where participants are receiving wages as outlined in section 142 of the Act.
The Department believes that payments in most work-based training activities should be equal to or exceed the minimum
wage to better approximate a work setting. With the exclusion of on-the-job training and disaster relief employment,
this change from ``wage'' to ``payment'' runs through the entire payments section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive Services. Supportive services are often critical in serving those most in need. The use of supportive
services is encouraged to enable the hard-to-serve population to participate in longer term interventions. The
objective assessment and, under title II, the ISS, is the basis for determination of need for a particular supportive
service. The major change in &sect;627.310 is that further documentation of need is not required. Supportive services
may be provided in-kind, through cash assistance, or by arrangement with another human service agency when necessary
to enable an individual eligible for JTPA training, but who cannot afford to pay for such services, to participate
in JTPA-assisted programs. Several commenters indicated that the administrative determination and documentation
of participants' actual cost, for example, of lunch or transportation, was unduly burdensome. Given the generally
narrow variance in cost for those services, most stated that a single dollar amount, or a schedule of dollar amounts,
would be equally prudent. The Department agrees that such a method is acceptable and should be outlined in the supportive
services policy of the SDA or SSG. To reduce its administrative burden, an SDA or SSG may set fixed levels of benefit
for particular supportive services; e.g., an SDA or SSG may reimburse participants who incurred transportation
expenses with identical payments, regardless of actual cost to an individual participant, even though some participants
may receive a payment above their actual cost and others may be underpaid.

Section 627.310(a) sets forth the parameters for the provision of supportive services. The preamble to the interim
final rule noted that ``limited supportive services'' were permitted for applicants. A few commenters requested
that this be stated in the regulations. This provision can now be found at &sect;627.310(b). A comment was also received
requesting that the ``limited'' in limited supportive services be defined. The Department declines to define ``limited'';
rather, the final rule is revised to indicate that such payments may be made to provide the applicant with an opportunity
to complete the application process. The Department expects the restriction on the training-related supportive
services cost category to act as a natural control on SDA's and SSG's while still permitting flexibility for local
level decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.310(g)(1) provides that supportive services may include financial assistance under title II. In order
to ensure a comprehensive system of supportive services and payments, there have been changes to the definition and
allowable usage of financial assistance. Financial assistance is intended for the purpose of general support typical
of stipends and allowances. A number of commenters indicated that requiring additional documentation in order to
receive any type of financial support was redundant, particularly with JTPA's hard-to-serve population. The Department
agrees that participants pass through significant income eligibility tests upon entering the program and that additional
eligibility checks are unnecessary, inefficient, and discourage the provision of necessary services. Therefore,
the final regulations state, at &sect;627.310(g)(2), that financial assistance may be deemed to be necessary for
eligible participants and, as a supportive service, may be a fixed payment or based upon a schedule of payments. The
SDA shall include financial assistance in its policy on supportive services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.305(g) of the interim final rule dealing with needs-related payments is redesignated &sect;627.310(h)
to reflect the similarity of needs-related payments under title III with financial assistance under title II. However,
needs-related payments are the only form of general ``cash'' assistance (excluding cash provided as a reimbursement
for transportation expenses, etc.) allowable under title III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters disagreed with the statement in the preamble to the interim final rule that supportive services could
not be based on a group characteristic, such as welfare. In light of the other changes made in the final rule, this statement
is no longer applicable. In developing the policy called for in the final rule, an SDA may use a group characteristic
as a basis for determining supportive service needs. For example, under title II, a financial assistance payment
to a participant may be fixed, based upon an income schedule or group characteristic (such as welfare recipient) identified
in the objective assessment and reported in the ISS, or may be determined in accordance with another method determined
by the SDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations reflect the Department's intent that financial assistance be treated as a supportive service for
the general welfare of the participant. This assistance is to be based upon the financial needs of an eligible individual
to permit the individual to participate in training. With this basic premise, the Department intends that financial
assistance payments, in addition to not being considered as income in accordance with section 142(b) of the Act, should
not be subject to income and employment taxes. However, all such decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Benefits and Working Conditions. The provision of &sect;627.310(b)&hyph;(d) of the interim final rule are redesignated
and revised as a new &sect;627.315. One commenter suggested that the regulations should not require participants
to work for employers that are violating labor laws. In response, &sect;627.315(a) is amended to reflect this concern
for compliance with applicable labor laws.

Reallotment and Reallocation. Section 627.410 implements the new section 109 of the Act, which requires the Governor
to reallocate, among SDA's in the State, unobligated funds in excess of 15 percent of any SDA's program year title II
allocation.

A number of commenters responded on the provisions of this section. Almost all of them recommended basing reallocations
on obligations rather than expenditures and questioned whether a State could adopt a more restrictive reallocation
policy based on expenditures. Most of the other comments were requests that the regulations further clarify the reallotment
and reallocation provisions of the Act including an interpretation of section 109(a)(3) of the Act concerning SDA's
that have the highest rates of unemployment for an extended period of time and the highest poverty rates. One commenter
pointed out a potential conflict between the provisions of section 109 of the Act, which bases reallocation on obligations,
and section 161(b)(1) of the Act, which ties reallocation to expenditures. Another commenter raised the issue of
whether Title II&hyph;B (summer) funds could be reallocated.

Given the legislative history of the statutory provision, particularly the 1991 House Committee Report (H.R. Rep.
No. 102&hyph;240, 63 and 64 (1991)), the Department believes that the intent of Congress was to ensure effective,
timely use of the funds. The Department previously suggested that another interpretation, based upon the provisions
of section 161(b) of the Act, might permit a more rigorous standard, such as expenditure. However, upon further review,
the Department believes that the language in the statute is clear in providing that the basis for reallocation is to
be the ``obligation'' of funds and the Department now believes that an interpretation that is more restrictive would
be inconsistent with the Act. A new paragraph (a)(2) is added that prohibits the Governor from imposing reallocation
requirements that are based on other than obligations. While it may be true, as some commenters suggested, that basing
reallocation solely on obligations may lead to last minute obligations of funds which have little program purpose
simply to avoid reallocation, the Department is constrained by the statutory language and cannot use that possibility
as a basis for varying from a clear statutory requirement.

In regard to further interpretation of section 109(a)(3) of the Act concerning SDA's that have the highest rates of

criterion and is leaving the interpretation of this section to each Governor, as provided in the Conference Committee

A few commenters responded to the provisions of &sect;627.415. A few other commenters on &sect;627.435, Allowable
costs and cost principles, suggested that &sect;627.435 should include provisions for allowing the costs of contributions
to reserves for self-insurance to be specifically allowed in that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments, paragraph (c) of &sect;627.415 of the interim final rule is removed and the substance
of the second sentence concerning contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program is moved to &sect;627.435(h).
The first sentence of this paragraph (c) basically repeated the provisions of &sect;627.315(b), Benefits and working
conditions, and is, therefore, unnecessary in this provision.

A few commenters were concerned about the scope of insurance coverage required by the rule. Some asked whether the
rule required them to provide insurance coverage for work-related activities or for all training. One thought that
the regulation required ``no fault'' coverage that could be satisfied through an ordinary comprehensive liability
policy. Section 627.415 does not address the scope of insurance coverage. Section 627.315(b) requires worker's
compensation or similar insurance coverage for work-related training activities. States and SDA's/SSG's should
provide such coverage as they deem prudent and as are in accordance with their normal insurance procedures, both in
terms of the types of risks covered and the method of coverage (self-insurance or purchase of insurance policies).

Some commenters thought that the procurement portion of the interim final regulations is an example of overregulation,
while others believed that the regulations did not go far enough. In response to the comments concerning overregulation,
the Department notes that section 164(a)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to take into consideration the OMB circulars
and that these regulations actually represent a pared-down version of the OMB Circulars. As such, they represent
less federal regulation than is applied to other Federal grant programs. In response to the comments concerning underregulation,
the Department does not agree. The requirements that are established should help maximize competition, ensure fiscal
accountability, and prevent fraud and abuse in JTPA programs. The Department believes that the final regulation
represents a reasonable balance between providing guidance on the issues on which the Secretary is required to set
minimum requirements under section 164(a)(3) of the Act and recognizing the prerogatives of the Governors to develop
their own procurement rules, which also is recognized in that provision.

Although at the Federal level there are rules for when to use contracts, grants and cooperative agreements, these
rules are not applicable to the JTPA. As a result, what one State calls a contract, another State might call a grant.
In order to avoid confusion in these regulations, the following terms are being used: ``Award'' or ``agreement''
means a contract, grant, subcontract, subgrant or other type of legal instrument; ``awardee'' means any one of the
entities receiving the award (e.g., contractors, grantees). There was concern expressed over whether buying certain
supplies, like floppy disks, at office supply stores and other similar businesses constitutes an award. Through
these regulations, an upper limit for small purchases (which can be lowered, but not raised, by the Governor's procurement
standards) is established. No further breakdowns are delineated in the regulations. The Governor can, through the
State procurement standards, establish other thresholds for the purchasing of consumable materials with credit
cards and such, and not require a formalized award process (e.g., competition or cost/price analysis) or document.
As an example, the current Federal ceiling is $2,500 per consumable item.

Section 627.420(a) reiterates the requirement established through the Amendments that the Governor establish
procurement standards to ensure fiscal accountability and prevent fraud and abuse in JTPA programs. This section
further requires the State and local levels to follow procurement policies and procedures used for non-Federal funds,
with some caveats, and reiterates the non-duplication requirement contained in section 107(b) of the Act. A small
number of commenters were concerned that the requirement that the State and local levels follow their own procurement
policies and procedures used for non-Federal funds would result in awards always being made to the lowest bidder without
other considerations, such as performance. State and local rules are to be followed as long as they comply with the
minimum requirements of the procurement section. One of the requirements for the selection of vendors and subrecipients
(discussed below) is that the awarding agency make a determination of demonstrated performance prior to award. If,
as a result of this determination, it is apparent that the lowest bidder cannot perform the work at an acceptable level
of quality, SDA's should not make an award to that bidder.

A few commenters were concerned that the nonduplication requirement of &sect;627.420(a)(5) would make it difficult
for SDA's to select service providers. This requirement reflects the provisions of section 107(b) of the Act and is
necessary to maximize the use of JTPA funds. One of the initial steps in any JTPA procurement should be a determination
concerning whether or not procuring such services (whether competitively or through sole source) would be a duplication.
The determination of non-duplication need not be exhaustive; it may take into account such things as the cost of the
existing services, waiting lists, the effectiveness of the services to be provided, and the likelihood of achieving
performance goals. Although there may be entities in the geographic area which provide the required services, these
entities may not provide the necessary customized training or may not be able to provide these services in a timely
manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters felt that the vendor/subrecipient distinction (see the definitions sections of the preamble and
the regulations) found in other parts of the regulations was not clear in this section. This section is intended to
apply to all awards and, for the purposes of this section, the same rules apply to the procurement of awards to both vendors
and subrecipients. Thus, the vendor/subrecipient distinction is not treated in this section as it is in other provisions
of the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 107(e) of the Act requires that selection of service providers include documentation of compliance with
procurement standards established by the Governor. Section 627.420(a) is expanded by adding a definition of procurement
to mean the process which leads to any award of JTPA funds. Some commenters wondered if the requirements for a determination
of demonstrated performance, contained in &sect;627.422, Selection of Service Providers, applied to vendors.
Based on the definition of service providers, this requirement does apply to vendors. On its surface it may appear
that the requirement for a determination of demonstrated performance goes against the requirements for full and
open competition. Since the overall goal of JTPA is to provide high quality services to eligible participants, the
requirement of the determination of demonstrated performance leads to the meeting of this goal by requiring the selection
of entities that can do the work effectively. This requirement further supports the fiscal accountability and prevention
of fraud requirements of the Act, since demonstrated performance includes such things as a satisfactory record of
integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(b) further delineates the Act's requirement of full and open competition. A few commenters asked
for definitions of certain terms, such as ``arbitrary action'' and ``overly restrictive specification.'' Since
each procurement action and system must be looked at on a case-by-case basis, the Department thinks that it would be
inappropriate to define these terms. If further definition is required at the State level, the Governor may do so in
the guidelines that he/she establishes. A few commenters were concerned that stricter State procurement codes could
take precedence over Federal regulations. These commenters are correct; the Governor has the discretion to make
the procurement rules more strict. However, the Governor does not have the authority, unless indicated in the law
or regulations, to make a legislative and/or regulatory requirement less strict. One commenter felt that paragraph
(b)(2)(i) should require an identification of quantities to be purchased. This change is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(c) establishes conflict of interest requirements. Although there is a separate subsection that
addresses PIC conflict of interest, PIC's were also included in the subsections that address recipient and subrecipient
conflict of interest. A few commenters correctly pointed out that by inclusion in the latter, it would make it impossible
for companies for which PIC members work to be awarded JTPA funds. This section is amended to remove the reference to
PIC members in paragraph (c)(2) and is reorganized to increase clarity. Paragraph (c)(4), which deals with PIC conflict
of interest is redesignated as paragraph (c)(3) but remains unchanged. Because of the separate treatment of PIC's
and recipients/subrecipients, the portions of paragraph (c)(2), which provide information on when a conflict of
interest would arise for either PIC's or recipients/subrecipients, are moved into a separate paragraph (c)(4).
It should be noted that the phrase ``is about to employ'' in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) also applies to cases of negotiation
for employment. The language is not changed in order to maintain consistency with the OMB Circulars. The original
paragraph (c)(5) is combined with paragraph (c)(1), since both deal with standards of conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters submitted comments on &sect;627.420(d). This section is based on OMB Circular A&hyph;102, and
describes the four procurement methods that are available to JTPA entities. Language is added to &sect;627.420(d)(1)(i),
prohibiting awards from being broken down into several purchases merely to be able to use small purchase procedures.
The Department does not intend that small purchase procedures be used improperly to avoid the more formal competitive
processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of these comments concerned paragraph (d)(4) of the interim final rule (redesignated in the final rule
as (d)(1)(iv)), which provides a listing of the circumstances under which recipients and subrecipients may use the
sole-source method of procurement. One of the circumstances calls for awarding agency approval of noncompetitive
proposals. The final regulations are changed to state that for SDA's, SSG's and subrecipients, the awarding agency
provides authorization; for States, the noncompetitive proposal is approved through the State's normal sole source
approval process. Without this change, States would have had to submit their proposed sole source awards that do not
meet one of the circumstances to the Department of Labor, the awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments require that all sole source awards be justified and documented in writing. When a State or other subrecipient
identifies specific entities that may be sole-source awardees (e.g., the Employment Service for assessment services)
by their subrecipients, the State or other subrecipient that identifies the specific entity is responsible for the
justification and documentation that serves as the basis for that specific sole source selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to both the OJT and classroom training (CRT) sole source exceptions, there was some confusion concerning
the requirement that not only does the procurement have to meet one of the criteria, but also has to be infeasible under
small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals. Clearly, OJT and individual CRT placements are
unique in the procurement world. Neither is usually procured through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process.
Although both should be procurable under small purchase procedures, some State rules may not allow this. As a result,
the regulations are revised to allow the sole source procurement of OJT (except awards to brokering contractors)
and individual CRT without having to demonstrate that the three other methods of procurement are infeasible. This
provision of the regulation may be used in the written justification for such sole source authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the sole source exception for procurement of ``Enrollment of individual participants in classroom training,''
some commenters expressed a concern that this would be used to justify sole source awards for the referral of a number
of individuals to the same classroom training. This exception may be used to justify a sole source award to place an
individual participant in classroom training. If a recipient or subrecipient, over the course of a year, makes sufficient
individual referrals to the point that the small purchase maximum is exceeded (either the level established through
these regulations or the State established level, whichever is lower), they will be expected to compete the requirement
the following year. If it is necessary to procure a class for JTPA participants only, it is not appropriate to use this
sole source exception. It may, though, be appropriate to use small purchase procedures or to justify the sole source
procurement of the class through other exceptions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters thought that setting up Labor Management Committees should be listed as one of the allowable sole
source criteria. The expenses incurred in the formation of these committees promoted by the State's Dislocated Worker
Units would be a rapid response expense (section 314(b)(1)(B)), subject to the financial management and procurement
procedures of the States. In most cases, it is expected that the costs of setting up a Labor Management Committee would
not be great and that small purchase procedures may apply. Therefore, the regulations are not changed. If a committee
were to apply to be a service provider, procurement rules would apply. If a committee, as a service provider, were to
use JTPA monies to procure services for participants, procurement rules also apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(d) is reorganized by redesignating the subordinate paragraphs and including a new paragraph (d)(2),
which authorizes units of State or local government or SDA and SSG administrative entities to pass through monies
to like organizations, e.g., a public housing authority, and not have the procurement requirements apply. When monies
are passed through, the receiving organization must either pass the monies through to a similar organization, or
procure services in accordance with the procurement rules. The passing through of funds is a method of transferring
monies to the actual entity doing the procuring which is practiced at the Federal, State, and local levels. The new
language reflects this acceptable practice. The Department cautions that organizations which may receive pass
throughs may also receive funds as service providers, in which case procurement rules will apply to awards to these
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters submitted comments on &sect;627.420(e). Section 164(a)(3)(C) of the Act established the
requirement that ``procurements shall include an appropriate analysis of the reasonableness of costs and prices.''
Several of the commenters disagreed with the use of the phrase ``cost or price analysis'' (as compared to ``cost and
price analysis''). The Department interprets the requirement of ``an appropriate analysis'' to mean that recipients
and subrecipients are required to do whatever analysis (price or both cost/price) is appropriate to their situation.
This is supported by OMB Circular A&hyph;102, which requires a price analysis alone under very limited circumstances,
and requires a price analysis whenever a cost analysis is undertaken. Additionally, the commercial reality is that
in many cases you either cannot do both a cost and price analysis (when there are no market prices or historical contract
prices available) or it would be superfluous to do both (when what is being bought is available at catalogue prices).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern was also expressed over the requirement that recipients and subrecipients perform a cost or price analysis
in connection with every procurement, including modifications. Some commenters believed that the paragraph (e)(1)
requirement for a cost or price analysis for all modifications should be changed to exclude non-monetary modifications.
After consideration of this concern, paragraph (e)(2) is amended to reflect this exclusion. Care should be taken,
though, in determining which modifications do not have monetary implications. For example, a modification to reduce
the number of participants may, on its face, appear to be non-monetary. This is not the case. A modification to reduce
the number of participants, without a corresponding reduction in funding, results in an increase in the cost per participant.
Therefore, this type of modification is one which has monetary impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(e)(2) describes cost or price analysis requirements. This paragraph is revised in order to make
it easier to read, but the requirements are not changed. This paragraph requires recipients and subrecipients to
make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. This requirement, which also comes from OMB Circular
A&hyph;102, appears to have caused confusion. A number of commenters felt that SDA's would not be able to develop such
estimates, due to the fact that they do not know which specific activities will be offered by a service provider until
offers are received in response to RFP's. In those cases where it is not known what specific services will be provided,
it will be appropriate for recipients and subrecipients to develop ``rough yardsticks,'' such as cost per placement
or cost per enrollee, for specific types of training. These independent estimates are used, in part, as a tool to determine
whether or not the proposals are correctly responding to the technical requirements of the RFP. The estimates are
also used to determine the reasonableness of costs/prices which are offered. An offer which is priced too low may be
indicative of, among other things, an offeror who does not understand the requirements of the RFP. An offer which is
priced too high may contain more expensive interventions than are required. Only through the comparison of the costs
and prices contained in each offer with the estimate can these potential problems be identified. It should be stressed,
however, that the independent estimates are not absolute barriers to accepting higher or lower cost proposals; the
estimates are merely meant for internal guidance. An awarding agency may select for award a proposal that is more or
less costly than the estimates, if it determines that the costs and price(s) are reasonable and that the services offered
meet program requirements. The level of detail that recipients and subrecipients need in developing these estimates
may be specified by the Governor in the State standards. Several commenters indicated that awarding agencies should
include the independent estimates in the RFP. Under no circumstances is this to be done. Since the purpose of developing
the estimates is for internal control, publicizing them would defeat the purpose for which they are developed and
might also skew the bidding.

One of the &sect;627.420(e)(2) requirements for cost analysis comes into play when the offeror is required to submit
the elements of the estimated cost. This is clarified by indicating that this requirement applies in the case of subrecipient
relationships. Subrecipients are required to allocate costs to the various JTPA cost categories; therefore, they
are to submit the separate elements of their costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(e)(3) reiterates the requirement of section 164(a)(3)(D) of the Act that ``procurements shall
not provide excess program income *&blank;*&blank;* or excess profit.'' The Act lists some of the factors that shall
be taken into consideration in determining whether program income or profit is excessive. Through the regulations,
additional factors from OMB Circular A&hyph;102 have been added. Further, based on this Circular, the instances
when profit or program income is negotiated are defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters on this section, as well as &sect;627.440, Classification of Costs, raised questions concerning
fixed unit price, performance-based contracts (FUPC's), including whether FUPC's could continue to be used and,
if so, whether costs could be allocated to the JTPA cost categories based on budgeted amounts or whether they must be
charged based on actual costs incurred. Concern also was expressed both over the requirement that offerors certify
their costs and the prohibition of excess program income or profit, in relation to fixed-price agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department continues to believe that the use of performance based awards may be of significant benefit in serving
JTPA customers. In addition, the use of a total fixed price or ceiling price in making awards may also be an effective
mechanism. The regulation does not prohibit reasonable profits in the context of a fixed-price agreement. Fixed-price
agreements are instruments that place more risk on the awardee than do cost reimbursement agreements. The reason
for this is that the awardee, under a fixed-price agreement must perform the work, regardless of the costs to the awardee.
In the case of an awardee under a cost reimbursement type of agreement, the awarding agency will reimburse the awardee
for its allowable costs. If the awardee under a fixed-price agreement is able to do the work at a lower cost, due to efficiencies
in operations, and this increases the level of profit, the awardee is due that additional profit. If successful awardees
who have increased profit due to efficient performance are required to reduce their earned profits to the budgeted
levels, this would result in a disincentive for organizations to perform their work more efficiently, quickly, etc.
If the additional profit results from cost data that was not accurate, complete or current, as certified, then the
awarding agency may be able to recoup that excess from the awardee. Thus, the requirement that costs be certified provides
a needed protection to awarding agencies. There has been skepticism that fixed price contracts, as utilized in JTPA,
did not contain risks for the awardee or operate as performance/outcome based agreements. The system can expect continued
high levels of scrutiny by the OIG in the case of fixed price agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of awards to subrecipients, when: (1) The awarding agency has done a cost and price analysis; (2) this analysis
has been documented; (3) the conclusions arrived at are reasonable; and (4) the offeror has certified in writing that
to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost and pricing data submitted are accurate, complete and current at the
time of agreement on price, the awarding agency may find it appropriate to use a fixed-price type of agreement. The
costs of such an agreement may be allocated among the benefitting cost categories based upon the ratios established
in the cost analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter did not believe that it was the Department's intent to require SDA's/SSG's to track profit earned by
commercial organizations. In point of fact, section 165(g)(1) of the Act requires each State, SDA, and SSG to maintain
records with respect to subrecipients, including commercial organizations, that identify any program income or
profit earned.

Section 627.420(e)(4) is amended to correct a miscitation from &sect;627.435(e) to &sect;627.435(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(e)(5) prohibits the use of the cost-plus percentage of cost method. This prohibition comes from
both OMB Circular A&hyph;102 and the FAR. A few commenters indicated that this was an advantageous procurement method.
This Federal-wide prohibition is being maintained in the final regulations due to the fact that these types of agreements
provide a disincentive to vendors/subrecipients to reduce costs, since the higher the overall cost of the agreement,
the higher the profit. It is recommended that JTPA entities negotiate specific dollar levels of profit, or investigate
the possible use of other types of agreements, such as cost-plus award fee. Further, there appears to be some misunderstanding
concerning the allowability of using fixed-price agreements. Fixed-price agreements are the preferred type of
agreement when using the sealed bid (Invitation for Bids) process. Fixed-price agreements may be performance-based
and may be chargeable to a benefiting cost category based upon a documented cost analysis, as discussed above, the
services provided, and whether the agreement is for tuition or for a commercially available training package, as
discussed in connection with &sect;627.440. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(g) which reiterates the requirement found in section 164(a)(3)(I) of the Act that procurement transactions
between units of State or local government or entities organized principally as the administrative entity for SDA's
or SSG's, shall be on a cost-reimbursable basis. The final rule now clarifies that cost-plus types of agreements are
not allowable (e.g., cost-plus fixed-fee). Based on one comment, language is added concerning the payment of tuition
and/or entrance fees to schools that are part of a governmental entity. The specific instances under which tuition
and entrance fees may be paid, without breaking them down to their specific cost elements, are listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters addressed &sect;627.420(h), which establishes the requirement that recipient and subrecipient
procurements clearly specify deliverables and the basis for payment, and include specified clauses. A few comments
were received questioning the example that was given in the preamble to the interim final regulations of withholding
final payment to an OJT contractor until the participant has been retained on the job for a specified period of time
after the completion of training. The commenters wondered if the Department has predetermined deliverables for
OJT. The discussion was intended merely as an example and does not set a hard and fast rule for OJT contracts, although
the Department sees that such a contract provision might facilitate retention upon completion of OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final regulations, paragraph (h)(2) on required clauses is revised, to break it into three paragraphs: clauses
required for subrecipient awards; vendor awards; and vendor and subrecipient awards. In response to concerns expressed,
the applicability of clauses such as copyright and rights in data is narrowed. Several commenters correctly pointed
out that the regulations did not specify what the patent, copyright and rights and data clauses should be. The final
rule is amended to remove the requirement for patent rights (since it is not expected that many patentable items will
be developed using JTPA funds) and to include additional information on copyright and rights in data clauses. In the
case of the copyrights clause requirement, the application of this clause is limited to those awards which involve
the use or development of copyrighted materials. Also, the breach of award and termination clauses are expanded to
cover all awards. In the newly designated paragraph (h)(4)(i), which relates to breach of agreements, this clause
is now required to be included in all agreements, rather than be limited to those which exceed the small purchase limit.
The rationale for this change is that a breach in a small purchase situation can be as damaging to the JTPA program as
those in large dollar awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(i) establishes the requirement that recipients and subrecipients have written protest procedures.
A few comments were submitted on this section. One wondered how paragraph (i)(2), the referral of violations of law,
related to TEGL 6&hyph;84 and the incident reporting system. This section of the regulations is amended to reference
&sect;627.500(b) of the regulations, which establishes the referral requirements.

Selection of Service Providers

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.422 establishes the requirements for the selection of service providers. One commenter felt that the
selection of service providers should be essentially a blind process, in which the specific sector of the provider
is secondary to the provider's demonstrated ability. This is an accurate statement of the general intent of the Amendments
and of the Department in developing this section of the regulations. Given the large amount of funds that are budgeted
for JTPA titles II and III, it is important to ensure that procurements are done in a manner that will not only promote
the integrity of the process and the efficient expenditure of the monies but will also allow organizations an opportunity
to fairly compete to provide these services. Although it may be administratively easier to sole source the bulk of
the JTPA monies, this not only is unfair to the other potential service providers in a specific geographic area, but
it also could result in a diminution of the number of organizations that are able to provide services to the JTPA system
as well as in an increase of costs due to the lack of competition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter correctly pointed out that the first sentence of &sect;627.422(b) was missing a reference to recipients
and subrecipients. The final rule is amended accordingly. A small number of commenters wondered why the regulations
call for the Governor to establish guidelines on the selection of service providers, when the Act calls for the Secretary
to establish guidelines. The Secretary has established minimum guidelines through these regulations. The Governor
is given the authority to expand on these guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422(c) establishes the requirement that when a State, SDA, SSG, or administrative entity determines
that it will provide services, it must first make a determination, in writing, under the standards of &sect;627.422(d),
of the demonstrated performance of its staff. A number of commenters expressed concern that this section went beyond
the intent of the Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters argued that the ``self-determination'' requirement is inappropriate because it infringes
on the rights of PIC's or SDA's to make their own decisions on the mix of services according to local considerations.
The self-determination requirement implements the requirements of sections 107 (a) and (e) and 164(a)(3)(A) of
the Act for competitive selection of service providers. These requirements do reduce local discretion to the extent
that they prevent any SDA/SSG from selecting its service providers without adherence to the rules of a competitive
selection process. An SDA/SSG may not select an ``independent'' service provider without adhering to the competitive
procurement rules which is as much an intrusion on its discretion as is the requirement that it justify its selection
of an in-house service provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Act's new emphasis on competition in the procurement process is to ensure that the JTPA program provides
the best available services at the most advantageous price. This rationale is equally applicable no matter what the
identity of the service provider. Obtaining services through a competitive selection process enables decisionmakers
to periodically review the quality of, necessity for, and cost of the services that are being used. It would defeat
the purpose of the competitive selection process if one kind of service or one kind of service provider were exempted
from this periodic review. Thus, it is critical to the integrity of the competitive selection process that the selection
of all service providers, including in-house providers, be subject to periodic review and to regular redetermination
of the quality and cost effectiveness of the services provided as well as their responsiveness to the needs of the participants.
For this reason, the Department has decided to retain the self-determination requirement in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters thought that this requirement was not needed since the sanctions that occur for failure to meet performance
standards provide all the protection needed against arbitrary decisions to perform services in-house. It is true
that these available sanctions will help lead to a better program, but the earliest that they will lead to the increased
full and open competition required by the Amendments is after two or three years when performance standards are not
met and the sanctions are imposed. Since it is the Department's intent to increase competition immediately, it is
appropriate to impose the self-determination requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments revealed some confusion over the types of services that would be covered by the requirement of paragraph
(c). Several commenters indicated that intake and assessment should not be included as services that should be competitively
procured. Covered services, in the final regulations, are defined to exclude intake and eligibility determination,
which are services that are the basic responsibility of SDA's/SSG's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern expressed was that a vote by a PIC to provide an activity in-house will require the PIC to vote on a matter
that will directly benefit the JTPA agency. Since the enactment of JTPA and the formation of PIC's, PIC's have had to
make decisions and vote on the provision of services internally. This may well be an apparent conflict of interest,
but the conflict is inherent in the role of the PIC, and it is a conflict whether or not the SDA is required to justify the
decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, if the requirement for self-determination had not been established in the regulations, States, SDA's,
SSG's, and administrative entities for SDA's and SSG's would be required to compete all of the services. It is not the
Department's intent to require recipients and subrecipients to go through a full fledged competitive process or
to impose onerous procedural requirements, but merely to assure that they periodically consider whether the methods
by which the services are provided meet the Act's standards for cost and quality. For States, SDA's and SSG's that have
already been running programs in-house, the determination to keep services in-house will be relatively easy. The
determination will be more involved for SDA's and SSG's that propose to conduct services and activities which have
traditionally been contracted out and should have a rationale for so doing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters provided reasons why they provided services in-house. These reasons included avoiding brokerage
fees for OJT development and providing backup capacity if contractors fail. Both these reasons for performing these
services in-house are legitimate ones, which should suffice as part of the justification required by this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters wondered where the self-determination of demonstrated performance should be documented. Since
it is not expected that the documentation be voluminous, the Department believes that it would be appropriate for
recipient and subrecipient administrators to address the criteria listed in paragraph (d) in writing, in the JTP,
GCSSP or EDWAA plan. In the case of the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) that the service provider possess, ``[t]he
ability to meet the program design specifications at a reasonable cost,'' recipients and subrecipients need not
undertake extensive cost comparisons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422(d) implements the requirement in section 107(a) of the Act that the Secretary develop guidelines
on determining demonstrated performance. Concern was also expressed that use of CBO's might be restricted by the
requirement in paragraph (d)(1) that service providers have adequate financial resources or the ability to obtain
them. Comments indicated that many CBO's only support is JTPA programs and their financial stability rests with their
ability to win JTPA contracts. Where the reimbursement method is used, the entity must either have the financial resources
to cover expenses until reimbursed, or must be able to obtain the financial resources through loans, etc. In the case
of CBO's, many will be placed on an advance method of payment. As a result, the financial resources test is considerably
less stringent. Awarding agencies should, however, check the financial stability of all organizations in order
to determine that they possess the financial wherewithal to adequately undertake a JTPA program and whether they
are on the verge of bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422 (e) and (f) reiterate the language of section 107 (a) and (c) of the Act concerning CBO's and educational
institutions. These provisions must be interpreted in conjunction with the goal of the regulations to establish
an ``even playing field.'' CBO's and educational institutions are to be provided copies of any RFP's, etc. Any proposals
that are received from CBO's and educational institutions are to be reviewed and rated in the same manner as proposals
from any other organizations. It must be noted that the 90/10 arrangements authorized for use with CBO's or non-profits
are not to be taken into consideration in the rating criteria. Based on the special mention in the Act of CBO's, it would
be appropriate in instances where competing proposals are rated the same, to use as a tie-breaker the status of the
organization submitting the proposal (i.e., CBO). In the case of educational institutions that are providing education
services, the language in the Act is more prescriptive. Therefore, in the case of a tie, the award must go to the educational
institution, unless the organization does not pass the demonstrated performance test. Further, paragraph (e) is
clarified in the final rule so that it is easier to read. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some questions were raised concerning instances where Statewide procurement policies call for awarding extra points
to proposals received from such organizations as minority-business enterprises and women-owned businesses. If
this is a State, SDA or SSG-wide policy, applicable to not only JTPA funds but other funds, the State, SDA or SSG may continue
applying these policies to JTPA funds. If these policies apply only to JTPA funds, States, SDA's or SSG's may not continue
applying these policies to JTPA funds. This is discussed in a new paragraph (l). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422(h) is redesignated as &sect;627.422(k) and reiterates the Act's requirement that awards include
appropriate amounts necessary for administration and supportive services (section 108(b)(5)). Several commenters
felt that SDA's/SSG's should be allowed to continue making awards that do not include administrative funds. It is
because of this practice that new language was included in the Amendments. In the past SDA's have indicated that, given
the 15 percent limitation on administrative costs, they do not receive sufficient administrative funds to operate
JTPA programs. It is equally difficult for other service providers to provide these same services when they are provided
either an even lower level of or no administrative funds. Some commenters thought that the regulations, as written,
will give service deliverers the right to claim whatever administrative costs they want. This is not the intent of
the regulation. While the regulation does prevent an SDA from arbitrarily refusing to fund a service provider's administrative
costs or from arbitrarily underfunding them, it creates no right in the service provider to demand any particular
level or amount of administrative funding. The level of administrative funding to be covered by the agreement should
be determined through negotiations. If either party is dissatisfied with the results of the negotiations, they should
not sign the agreement. Such disagreements may be handled under State and local grievance procedures. Some commenters
were concerned that awardees that fail to perform would argue that insufficient administrative funds were provided
and, thus, were the cause of the failure. Because the agreement should be mutual, it should be difficult for an awardee
to use this argument to excuse lack of performance. The Department does wish to note that it is inappropriate for the
SDA to pre-determine that it will not provide administrative costs for awardees except in the payment of tuition or
off-the-shelf prices. Others requested that guidance be given on how to determine appropriate amounts of administrative
funds. The Department thinks this type of clarification is more appropriately provided at the State level.

No comments were received on paragraphs 627.422 (i) and (k). These two paragraphs are redesignated as (h) and (j),
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The redesignated &sect;627.422(j) (now &sect;627.422(i)), which references back to section 204(d)(2)(B) of the
Act, deals with the selection of subrecipients for the provision of services to older workers. One commenter thought
that this section provides the justification for sole-sourcing older worker programs at the State level. This is
not the Department's intent. These programs are to be competed just like any other program. Others thought that only
the Governor has the responsibility for selecting service providers. With the addition of the pass-through provision
(at &sect;627.420(d)(2)), this does not have to be the case since the Governor can delegate his/her authority for
selection through the pass-through process.

Funding Restrictions for ``High-Risk'' Recipients and Subrecipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were submitted on &sect;627.423. Several of the commenters thought that this section was in conflict
with &sect;627.422(d), which requires a determination of demonstrated performance. The intent of this section
is not to give preferential status to high-risk recipients and subrecipients, but to provide JTPA entities with the
authority to impose funding restrictions should it be necessary to contract with such an entity. There may be instances
when awarding agencies have to make subrecipient awards to high-risk organizations because they are the only entity
providing the required service. By including this section, awarding entities may do so, but are authorized to include
restrictions on the award in order to protect the Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters thought that the regulations, as written, would give high-risk grantees an argument that they have
a right to be considered and selected. This is not the case. This section does not confer a right of selection to high-risk
organizations. Given the choice of comparable proposals from an offeror who has demonstrated performance and a high-risk
recipient/subrecipient, the award should be made to the former, unless other factors indicate otherwise. Additional
language is added to &sect;627.422(d) to clarify these points. Finally, editorial changes are made to clarify that
this section applies to all awards, not just grants or subgrants.

Section 627.424 applies the Federal government-wide requirements on awards to debarred or suspended parties contained
in Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 and implemented for all Department of Labor grant programs in regulations codified
at 29 CFR part 98. These requirements were previously issued to JTPA Liaisons in a Grant Officer Notice dated April
30, 1992. As provided in 29 CFR part 98, certifications are not required for the State legislatively required ``pass-through''
of JTPA funds to SDA's/SSG's since these are considered ``mandatory awards'' and are, therefore, exempt from the
29 CFR part 98 requirements. However, any other subaward over $25,000, such as an SDA award with a service provider,
must meet the ``lower-tier'' certification. These ``lower-tier'' certifications are to remain with the respective
awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that language be added to this section that tells States and subtier grantees that they may
elect to subscribe to the List of Parties Excluded from Procurement or Non-Procurement Programs. This has not been
done, since nothing in these regulations prohibits JTPA entities from subscribing to this publication, and using
it as a resource.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.425(b) of the interim final rule requires financial systems and procedures of recipients and subrecipients
to be in accordance with GAAP and &sect;627.435(a) requires costs charged to the JTPA program to also be in accordance
with GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised questions or issues about GAAP, including requesting that the Department be more specific
about how GAAP must be applied by States and SDAs, requesting specification of which GAAP to use, and, if GAAP is to be
determined by the Governor, if the Governor can waive GAAP provisions. A few commenters requested that the statutory
language of section 164(a)(1) of the Act pertaining to GAAP applicable in each State be included in &sect;627.425(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language is added to &sect;627.425(b) to provide for the applicability of GAAP in each State. The Department recognizes
that GAAP vary by type of organization or entity and that, while there is great similarity among them, multiple versions
of GAAP exist for each type of entity. It is the Department's intent, by adding this language, in addition to the language
in paragraph (a) of &sect;627.435, to allow the Governor to determine which specific versions of GAAP are to be used
in each State and by which types of entities, should this be at issue in any State. It is not intended to give the Governor
authority to waive GAAP provisions since the Act requires the use of GAAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``liabilities'' is added to the list of financial information that financial systems must include at &sect;627.425(b)(1)(i).

A few commenters indicated that revised financial reporting requirements need to be issued by the Department, consistent
with &sect;627.455, so that changes to accounting and other financial systems could be made that also meet the reporting
requirements. Revised financial reporting requirements for JTPA title II programs were issued by the Department
in Training and Employment Information Notice (TEIN) No. 6&hyph;93 dated July 30, 1993 (OMB No. 1205&hyph;0323).
Revised financial reporting requirements for title III programs were issued by the Department in TEIN's Nos. 14&hyph;93

In regard to participant data systems, a few commenters sought clarification regarding eligible applicants for

to make a determination of eligibility. The Department expects that such a determination will be made within a reasonable
time after the information is obtained.

Grant Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.430 establishes standards by which the Department will make payments to States as well as standards for
States, SDA's, SSG's, and other subrecipients for making payments to lower tier subrecipients. Included within
this section are standards for when advances to subrecipients are appropriate, when the reimbursement method is
appropriate, and provision is made for using the working capital advance payment method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters addressed the provisions of this section. A few commenters raised concerns related to the Cash
Management Improvement Act (CMIA) and primarily suggested that the Department should delay CMIA requirements since
SDA's/SSG's are waiting on the Department to publish CMIA standards. One commenter pointed out that at the current
time, the Treasury Department regulations at 31 CFR part 205 do not go beyond the State level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMIA applies only to States and does not carry through to subrecipients that are not a part of the State government.
The Treasury Department published final regulations to implement CMIA at 31 CFR Part 205 on September 24, 1992. The
Department does not plan to publish any additional CMIA standards applicable to grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that the September 24, 1992, Treasury Department regulations dropped the requirements
that previously existed pertaining to subrecipients of States as well as non-State recipients. Therefore, the basic
cash management standard of paragraph (b) of this section is revised to incorporate the standard that is generally
applicable to other Federal grant programs. That standard is also generally consistent with the standard applicable
to the JTPA program prior to the publication of the interim final rule. In addition, the requirement to maintain procedures
as a part of the standard is deleted so that the standard is based only on the demonstration of effective cash management
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters raised questions of whether subrecipients other than CBO's and non-profit entities could receive
advances or working capital advances. A few commenters wanted clarification on the specific requirements for payments
to contractors. It is the intent of this section to provide for advances to any subrecipient as long as the subrecipient
is in compliance with the basic cash management requirement that cash on hand shall be limited to actual immediate
disbursement needs for program purposes. A subrecipient that does not meet that standard may be paid by either of the
other two payment methods outlined in this section. The Department recognizes that, given the definitions in &sect;626.5
for subrecipient and contractor and the procurement requirements of the Act and these regulations, there is no need
to establish separate payment requirements applicable to contractors. Therefore, paragraph (b)(2) of the interim
final rule is removed from the final rule and corresponding language adjustments are made throughout the remainder
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested clarification of the requirement, in paragraph (f) of this section, which requires disbursement
of cash received as a result of program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest
earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments in light of the time frame for the use of program income
at &sect;627.450, Program income. The requirement in &sect;627.430(f) is a cash management requirement to ensure
that cash attributable to JTPA does not remain in a bank account while at the same time the entity is drawing additional
cash from the Treasury Department to meet immediate JTPA disbursement needs. Any cash attributable to JTPA should
be immediately disbursed for whatever JTPA disbursement need exists. That need does not have to be the same as the entity's
planned use of program income earnings nor does it relieve the entity of its liability to provide, within the funding
period, an amount of program services equivalent to the amount of program income earned. At the time cash is needed
for disbursement for the purposes for which the program income was planned to be used, it can be accessed through normal
JTPA grant payment processes. Language is added to paragraph (f) of &sect;627.430 to more clearly apply this requirement
to cash proceeds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.435 provides generic cost principles applicable to the JTPA program in paragraphs (a) through (d) and
provides specific treatment for selected items of cost in paragraphs (e) through (h). A few commenters stated that
the Department should adopt the Circulars for cost principles, thereby replacing this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 164(a)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations establishing uniform cost principles
substantially equivalent to those generally applicable to recipients of Federal grant funds. The generic cost principles
in this section are intended to be substantially the same as the provisions of Attachment A of the OMB Circulars that
contain cost principles and should generally be interpreted the same as the Circulars. The Department has chosen
not to simply adopt the Circulars because they contain some restrictive requirements in areas where the Department
thinks that recipients and subrecipients should retain operational flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters recommended that the prohibition on the shifting of funds in &sect;627.435(c) should be changed
to clarify that it does not cover accounting errors. The Department agrees with this comment and language is added
to limit this prohibition to costs ``allocable'' to another Federal grant, program, or category. Adjustments should
be made for costs inappropriately charged because of accounting errors or misclassification so that the costs ultimately
charged to a cost objective are those properly allocable to that objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested revision of the prohibition on contributions to contingency reserves at &sect;627.435(e)(6),
particularly that they should be allowable if such contributions are not made with Federal funds. The language on
contingency reserves is not changed since only those costs charged to the JTPA program are regulated by this section
and it does not extend to non-JTPA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amended &sect;627.435(f) provides additional guidance on legal costs. A number of commenters recommended changes
in this area, with most commenters opposed to the specific prohibition on the allowability of costs for appeals to
an Administrative Law Judge. Several commenters suggested that the Department should review the Conference Report
language on this issue. A few commenters requested more specificity on legal expenses, particularly settlement
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments received on the specific prohibition on the allowability of legal costs for appeals to
an Administrative Law Judge, the Department has reviewed the Conference Report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 102&hyph;811,
102d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 137 (1992)) and engaged in further dialogue on this subject. The discussion in section 221
of the Conference Report pertained to title IV special programs for Migrants and Seasonal Farmworkers and the Department
does not view that language as carrying through to the other titles of JTPA. The Department is also aware that some Federal
agencies are permitting the costs of appeals to an ALJ as an allowable grant cost. The Department notes that, unlike
the process of the Department of Health and Human Services that is referred to in the Conference Report, there are several
opportunities for informal resolution of disputes prior to the issuance of the Department of Labor grant officer's
final determination. In addition, if the grant officer's decision is found, upon appeal, to be substantially in error,
there may be an opportunity for a grantee to recover its legal costs under the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice
Act. Congress, in passing the Equal Access to Justice Act, has set forth the conditions under which it is appropriate
for parties in contested administrative proceedings to recover their costs from the federal government. The rule
that is adopted in these regulations maintains those conditions. Finally, it is the Department's position that,
absent any specific statutory direction, Federal taxpayers should not bear the costs of both sides of a matter appealed
to an ALJ. To do so may increase the incidence of such costs and provides no incentive for assuring that only matters
of substantive merit are appealed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the language on settlement costs, paragraph (f)(1) of this section is changed to clarify that settlement
costs are allowable to the extent that the costs included in the settlement would have been allowable if charged to
the JTPA program at the time they were incurred, e.g., if the settlement costs are for back pay then the provisions of
&sect;627.435(e)(2) would control the allowability of the settlement costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.435(h) of the interim final rule basically continued the language on construction costs that has existed
since the inception of JTPA. However, a few commenters recommended changes to this paragraph including that construction
costs for alterations, maintenance, and repairs should be allowable and that there is now a conflict with amended
&sect;627.210(a)(3) concerning physical accessibility, as required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with these comments and the language on construction costs is eliminated. The effect of this
change is to allow construction costs to the extent that such costs are necessary and allocable to JTPA. Paragraph
(h) of the final rule now contains language on contributions to a reserve for self-insurance, as discussed above in
the discussion of &sect;627.415(c), Insurance.

Governor's Guidelines on Allowable Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.435(i) requires the Governor to prescribe and implement guidelines on allowable costs not otherwise
treated in &sect;627.435 and contains a listing of selected items of costs in paragraph (i) for which the Governor's
allowable cost guidelines must, at a minimum, prescribe treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters responded to the provisions of this subsection. Most of them saw it as a requirement for Governors
to set actual amounts for salaries and other commonly incurred JTPA costs and opposed this subsection. One commenter
recommended that the Department should clarify the intent of this provision and a few commenters asked whether the
requirements of the regulation would be met if the OMB Circulars on cost principles were adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is not basically different from the requirement, in existence since the beginning of JTPA in 1983,
that ``[t]he Governor shall issue guidelines on allowable costs for *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Such guidelines should
set parameters and guidance, rather than actual amounts. The Department's intent is simply to ensure that the Governor's
guidelines cover at least the items included in the list, since issues have been raised on each of these items during
the past 10 years of JTPA. Recognizing that SDA's retain some flexibility, within the Governor's guidelines, to establish
amounts for allowable costs such as personnel compensation and travel, the final rule is changed by replacing the
words ``and amounts'' with ``or the extent of allowability.'' In addition, since other sections of the final rule
now provide guidelines on item No. 11, the extent of allowability for supportive services costs and payments to participants,
that item is removed from the list in this section of the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For most States, the existing allowable cost guidelines of the Governor already meet the requirements of this paragraph
and few, if any, changes are necessary. All States should review their current allowable cost guidelines and ensure
that each of the 16 listed cost items are treated consistently, as well as any other cost items for which the Governor
thinks consistent treatment is necessary. A commenter raised the question about whether the regulatory requirement
would be met if the OMB Circulars on Cost Principles were adopted. The Department agrees that all 16 cost items would
be covered if the Circulars were adopted. The Department cautions, however, that: (1) It does not intend to approve
or disapprove any prior approval requests, as required by the Circulars, and (2) the OMB Circulars contain restrictive
requirements in areas in which States, SDA's, and SSG's may desire greater flexibility, e.g., staff compensation,
fees/profits, fund-raising.

Administrative Cost Pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.440(a) is amended in the final rule to add language on cost pools. Section 627.440(f) of the interim final
rule required that costs charged initially to a JTPA administrative cost pool (ACP) be allocated, for JTPA Federal
reporting purposes, to the benefitting programs based on the benefits received by each program. The Department recognized
that this language represented a departure from previously established policy on the manner in which pooled administrative
costs could be reported. Commenters were requested to identify the impact, if any, of the revised requirement to allocate
pooled administrative costs solely on the basis of ``benefits received''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters responded to the provisions of this paragraph. Most of the responses fell into one of three groups.
One group viewed the ACP language as effectively prohibiting ACP's by requiring detailed time distribution or some
type of cost allocation process for each item of joint administrative cost. These commenters thought the new requirements
involved too much recordkeeping, were an unreasonable burden, inefficient, illogical, and went beyond the requirements
of OMB Circular A&hyph;87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second group expressed concerns about the effect of the ACP requirement on the administrative cost limitations
for each program and that they would lose their ability to ensure cost limits are not exceeded. They were also concerned
programs would be overexpended. A few commenters stated that there are not enough administrative funds available
for EDWAA at the State level to absorb its share of costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third group of commenters made suggestions that included going back to the old regulatory language, which allowed
``true cost pools'', specifying that using direct expenditures was an acceptable methodology, and requiring application
of A&hyph;87 principles. One commenter suggested eliminating any mention of ACP's in the regulations and, instead,
requiring JTPA entities to follow GAAP and section 108(a) of the Act. In addition, a few commenters requested guidance
on the use of intake cost pools. Several commenters raised questions about the proper charging of title II&hyph;B
administrative costs at the State level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also raised questions about the ``benefits received'' language of paragraph (a) in &sect;627.440,
which requires all JTPA costs to be charged to the benefitting programs and cost categories based on benefits received.
That language has been a part of the JTPA regulations since the inception of the program. A few commenters recommended
that this paragraph should specifically allow cost pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACP language contained in &sect;627.440(f) of the interim final rule was not intended to eliminate the use of ``true
cost pools'' in accounting for the costs of JTPA programs. It was also not intended to go beyond the requirements of
section 108(a) of the Act, GAAP, paragraph (a) of this section or similar provisions in OMB Circular A&hyph;87. The
final rule removes the specific ACP provisions in paragraph (f) and adds a new sentence on cost pools within paragraph
(a). The new sentence is intended to be consistent with the A&hyph;87 meaning and treatment of cost pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JTPA entities may continue to use ACP's. They may also continue to use indirect cost pools, training cost pools, intake
cost pools, pools for supplies expense, and any other pool they find beneficial to have in their accounting system,
including intermediate cost pools for the recording and temporary accumulation of joint or similar types of costs,
pending distribution (allocation) at a later date to the benefitting cost objectives, e.g., programs and/or JTPA
cost categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having, or using, a JTPA ACP has never been an issue and is not one now. The issue is how to distribute or allocate those
accumulated costs back to the benefitting programs and whether allocation methodologies other than ``benefits
received'' by each of the benefitting programs can be used. The ``old'' JTPA regulations did not address this issue.
Since the 1992 Amendments directly incorporate the requirement to follow GAAP, and GAAP requires costs to be charged
based on ``benefits received,'' the basic issue is whether the Department can waive a specific statutory requirement,
especially when it affects up to 20 percent of the funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Department's experience that allocation based on ``benefits received'' has not added much workload burden
and alternative methodologies have been developed by most JTPA entities. For many JTPA entities, allocating administrative
costs based on each program's share of total direct costs, salaries and fringe benefits, or total program costs compared
to the total direct costs, total salaries and fringe benefits, or total costs of all programs administered by an entity
are acceptable methodologies. The Department cautions, however, that some of these methodologies may not be acceptable
for particular JTPA entities. Each organization is different and costs, particularly direct costs, are charged
differently. It will require a self-examination by each entity to determine the best approach. Assistance can also
be obtained from the State's or SDA's auditor. The use of financial-based methodologies is encouraged; however,
the Department will accept any treatment of pooled costs and allocation methodologies that are consistent with GAAP
applicable in each State. The Department cautions that a methodology that is based solely on contribution to the pool
may be questioned in audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in response to the questions about the proper charging of title II&hyph;B administrative costs at the State
level, &sect;627.440(b) establishes the JTPA cost objectives for State-administered programs and the State's
overall administration of title II activities. To clarify this issue, however, &sect;627.440(b)(10) is revised
in the final rule to specifically include State administrative costs associated with title II&hyph;B.

Classification of Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.440 establishes the minimum levels of accountability for JTPA funds, provides the Secretary's definitions
of the cost categories, and provides specific treatment for the classification of certain types of costs that have
frequently been at issue in the JTPA system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;627.440(c)(2), the regulations provide that incentive funds, both title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, received
by an SDA may be combined and used without regard to cost categories or cost limitations. A number of commenters on this
provision were pleased with the treatment accorded incentive funds, however, several commenters appeared to have
missed or misread this provision. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the definitions of the JTPA cost categories, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.440(d), a number of comments expressed concern about the treatment of tuition, work experience wages,
insurance, and the difference between public information costs and the costs of outreach. Another frequent comment
concerned the treatment of project directors and other positions that perform both administrative and program functions.
Commenters on this subject fell into two groups. One group, which appeared to have missed the provisions of paragraph
(e)(1), argued that the costs of such positions should not all be charged to administration. Some requested that such
positions be charged entirely to training. The other group, focusing on paragraph (e)(1), commented on the burden
and mechanics of time distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the language in the preamble of the interim final rule concerning tuition was somewhat
inconsistent and more restrictive than this section of the regulations. The Department's intent is to permit costs
frequently associated with tuition costs, such as entrance fees, to also be charged to the direct training category.
The Department believes that the regulation adequately expresses this intent. In addition, tuition, entrance fees,
and other usual and customary fees of other educational institutions, such as postsecondary vocational institutions
specified at section 481(c) of the Higher Education Act, are another example of payments to vendors that are appropriately
charged to the direct training category. The final rule removes the reference to section 141(d)(3)(B) of the Act to
clarify that such payments to any educational institution in a vendor relationship that also satisfies the other
criteria of paragraph (d)(1)(vi)(B), are direct training costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where tuition is part of a subrecipient agreement, rather than a vendor relationship, and the agreement also includes
other components, the costs of tuition are chargeable to the direct training category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d)(1)(vii) is added to the final rule specifying that payments to participants that represent hours
spent in a direct training activity (such as work experience) are direct training costs. In addition, the word ``insurance''
is removed from the definition of administration since this is a type of cost that should be charged or allocated to
each of the benefitting categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised the question of how the costs of curriculum development or training materials should be charged.
The Department believes that these costs are properly charged to the direct training cost category.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few comments were received on public relations costs versus the costs of outreach. These comments tended to view
public relations as an outreach cost and recommended that it be charged to the training related and supportive services
category. The Department agrees that public relations can be an effective tool that enhances outreach activity,
but also believes that the costs of general public relations is more appropriately a part of the overall costs of administration.
No change is made in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also agrees with commenters that time distribution should be reasonable and not burdensome and that
alternative distribution bases should be allowable. Language is added to paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(3)(i), and
(e)(1) to provide that other equitable cost allocation methods may be used. Other equitable cost allocation methods
may be either financial based or non-financial based methods.

Limitations on Certain Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.445(d) of the interim final rule clarified the provision made in section 141(d)(3)(C) of the Act for excluding
administrative costs incurred by CBO's or non-profit organizations from the SDA's administrative cost limitation
under certain criteria and conditions specified in the Amendments. A number of commenters responded to that provision
and regulatory clarification. Most of these commenters incorrectly perceived the 10-percent limitation as an absolute
ceiling on administrative costs for CBO's and other non-profit service providers and requested relief from that
ceiling. Other commenters raised questions of whether the 90/10 provisions were based on budget or actual expenditures
and the effect on the 90/10 provision if more than 10 percent is expended by the CBO or other non-profit service provider
for administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the provisions of section 141(d)(3)(C) of the Act and paragraph (d) of the regulations
do not constitute a mandatory ceiling on administrative costs for CBO's and other non-profit service providers.
The relief provisions apply to the SDA's administrative cost limitation and are only applicable for those situations
in which the SDA and the CBO or other non-profit service provider agree to the 90/10 arrangement. Where such agreement
is reached, the SDA may avail itself of the relief to total administrative costs only if the actual expenditures of
the CBO or other non-profit service provider conforms to the 90/10 provisions. Costs charged to the JTPA program for
the costs of a CBO or other non-profit service provider that are for less than 90 percent for direct training and training-related
and supportive services costs or for more than 10 percent for administrative costs negate the applicability of this
provision.

Program Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.450 contains a definition of what is and what is not program income for JTPA purposes, including the incorporation
of the new provisions of section 141(m) of the Act, and establishes timeframes and requirements for the treatment
and use of program income. The JTPA cost categories and the administrative cost limitations are also made applicable
to program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters responded to the provisions of this section. The comments contained a number of suggestions,
including: That the Department should adopt the OMB Circular A&hyph;102 definition of program income; that program
income should not be subject to the cost categories or administrative cost limitation; and that the regulations should
eliminate the presumption that a contractor is entitled to the earned revenues by law, especially a contractor with
whom the State or SDA is no longer contracting. Other commenters raised the question of whether earned program income
must be used for the same program or subtitle that earned it and still others requested clarification of the time frame
for use of program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's intent to adopt the basic A&hyph;102 definition of program income and to add to that definition
the specific provisions of section 141(m) of the Act. In addition, the Department recognizes that the potential to
earn significant amounts of program income exists within the Act and these regulations. To avoid the possibility
of creating windfalls of administrative funds available to entities that choose to use the new provisions in such
a manner, the Department is imposing the administrative cost limitation on program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141(m) of the Act specifies that program income may be retained by the entity that earned it and used for program
purposes. The Department believes that the regulations, as written, are consistent with the statutory provision
and that there is no authority to empower any other entity to use the funds, as long as the entity that earned the program
income uses the funds for program purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the questions about whether program income must be used for the same program or subtitle that earned
it, or if it may be used for any JTPA program or title, the Department agrees that clarification is needed. While the
interim final regulations limited the use of program income to the particular JTPA grant or subgrant under which it
was earned, it is recognized that particular grants or subgrants may provide funds for multiple programs or subtitles.
Therefore, paragraph (c) of this section of the final rule is amended to also limit its use to the JTPA title under which
it was earned. In addition, language is added to paragraph (c)(3) to clarify that the time period for the use of program
income is the funding period, usually up to three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was brought to the Department's attention that section 141(m) of the Act does not exempt interest earnings by States
from the provisions applicable to income under the Act and, therefore, the regulations could not either. The Department
agrees, however, the State is required by the CMIA, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6503(c), to pay interest on advanced funds
from the time that the funds are deposited by the United States to the State's account until the time that the funds are
paid out by the State for program purposes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that it is equitable that the State be able to use the interest it may earn on these funds towards
satisfying the interest debt created by the CMIA and does not desire to cause States to both meet any interest liability
under the CMIA and provide additional JTPA program services with the same interest earnings. Therefore, paragraph
(a)(v) is revised in the final rule to eliminate the exception for interest earnings by States and paragraph (c), Use
of program income, is revised to permit the State's use of such income to meet its CMIA liability. In addition, the application
of the administrative cost limitations in paragraph (c) is also revised to exempt program income used by States to
meet its CMIA liability from the administrative cost limitation.

Reports Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.455 requires financial reporting to be on a quarterly basis and costs to be reported on an accrual basis
by year of appropriation. A few commenters asked whether participants must also be reported by year of appropriation
and several commenters asked whether costs may be charged to the oldest available appropriation, i.e., first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified in &sect;627.455(a), reporting instructions are to be issued by the Secretary. The statutory requirement
to report by year of appropriation is limited to financial data. With regard to FIFOing of costs, the Department has
no objections to an entity FIFOing costs it incurs itself as long as obligational authority exists for multiple years
and the costs are for the same purposes and under the same terms and conditions that accompanied each year's obligational
authority. This approach limits FIFOing to each individual JTPA entity and does not include one entity FIFOing costs
incurred by another entity, even if the other entity is a subrecipient of the original one. Restated, once a JTPA cost
is recorded by any subrecipient, it must be recorded against a given year of funds and remains a cost charged to that
year of funds. It may not be recorded or reported by another entity against a different year of funds. No changes are
made to the final rule.

Requirements for Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.460(a) imposes the record retention requirements of section 165(e) of the Act on State records and provides
the State two options for subrecipient records. A few commenters encouraged the Department to drop the option for
subrecipient records and require all subrecipients to comply with the record retention provisions imposed on subrecipients
by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Act is unclear about its effect on subrecipient records, it is the Department's intent, by providing an option
for retention of subrecipient records, to allow each State to determine if subrecipients of the State should each
have its own clock for the starting point for record retention, rather than having all records of all subrecipients
throughout a State controlled by the one State clock. This option avoids requiring all subrecipients in a State to
maintain records beyond the prescribed period just because a claim, audit, or litigation has started that affects
only one or a few subrecipients. It also enables JTPA subrecipients to maintain and dispose of JTPA records in the same
timeframes that apply to other records of the subrecipient that are covered by applicable OMB Circulars. It is expected
that either approach will result in most JTPA records, other than property records, being maintained for the same
total 5-year period of time. Subrecipients that are opposed to this approach should encourage their State to not adopt
the option provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is changed in the final rule to add the statutory requirement for property records
to be retained for three years after final disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.460(d) of the interim final regulations authorizes the substitution of copies made by microfilming
for original records. A few commenters raised questions about the allowability of retaining records in forms other
than microfilming, such as computer imaging or scanning, and other types of computer generated data and electronic
files. In response to these comments, the Department has revised this provision. Instead of authorizing a particular
medium for record retention, the revised provision sets a standard that the method of retention must be sufficient
to assure that the record is useable as evidence in an audit or any other JTPA proceeding. As before, the substitution
of microfilmed or photocopied records can continue to be used since these media are generally accepted as admissible
for evidentiary purposes. The Department takes no position on the use of records stored on electronic media and the
revised regulation neither authorizes nor specifically forbids their use. If electronic storage media were to be
considered for use, the user would have to be certain that there are sufficient security safeguards and protections
against tampering so that a court would accept the record as evidence in a proceeding. As in any case where a record is
maintained, the burden of producing and authenticating it is on the custodian of the record and the failure to authenticate
the record will lead to the custodian's being unable to use the record for any evidentiary purpose. Thus, if an SDA maintains
its participant eligibility records on computer files and is unable to show that the records were secure or were tamperproof,
the records could not be used to prove that participants were eligible for JTPA services.

Public Access to Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 165(a)(4) of the Act requires recipients to make available to the public upon request certain records which
are maintained by the recipients pursuant to section 165(a)(1) of the Act. Section 637.463 of the interim final rule
was intended to merely reflect the statutory requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments were received expressing concerns that such disclosure would result in the invasion of personal
privacy and would breach basic notions of customer confidentiality. In this same regard, some comments contended
that this requirement conflicts with State privacy laws and that the statement in the regulation with this requirement
applied ``notwithstanding the provisions of state or local law'' goes beyond the plain meaning of section 165(a)(4)
of the Act. Another comment asked for a definition of the word ``clearly'' in the term ``clearly unwarranted invasion
of privacy''. One comment questioned the provision in the regulation ``excepting'' recipient and subrecipient
records from the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Several comments requested that the regulations place
reasonable time and place restrictions on the right of access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.463 is revised to follow more closely the statutory language. There is no intent to modify or expand on
the plain meaning of the statute.

It is clear that reasonable conditions can be placed on the mechanics of providing access, including time and place
restrictions. It is preferable that such management details be developed at the State and local levels and not in these
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute and the regulations permit customer confidentiality by excluding from mandatory disclosure information
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. A Federal definition of that phrase is
unnecessary since it is a term best defined in local situations by State or local law. A State or local privacy law or
requirement which prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information which constitutes an unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy would not be in conflict with the JTPA public access requirement. On the other hand, the Act's requirement
of public access is a statutory condition to the receipt of grant funds and a conflicting State requirement does not
excuse a failure to comply. In other words, if a State or local law applicable to all records exempts certain specific
kinds of identifying information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 name, address, social security number or other personal identifying information), it could be applied to restrict
the disclosure of some of the information in a JTPA applicant's or participant's file. On the other hand, a State or
local law which prohibited disclosure of all employment and training records would sweep so broadly that it would
conflict with the Act's disclosure requirement. In order to emphasize that requirement, the informational provision
in the regulation that the public access requirement applies ``notwithstanding the provision of the State or local
law'' is retained in the final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``informational'' statement regarding the Freedom of Information Act produced some confusion and is removed
from the final regulation. The only reason this statement was put into the interim final regulation was that the coverage,
or non-coverage, of the Federal Freedom of Information Act has been a recurring subject of inquiry. The Freedom of
Information Act applies to the disclosure of records in the custody of Federal agencies. In like manner, the Privacy
Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to records described in section 165 of the Act. Section 627.460 records are not Federal
records until submitted to the Secretary. Until then, they are not covered by federal ``freedom of information''
or ``privacy'' requirements.

Section 627.465 reflects the requirements of section 141(r) of the Act, which provides that the Federal requirements
generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments are the requirements governing the title,
use, and disposition of real property, equipment, and supplies purchased with JTPA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments are codified for
Department of Labor grant programs at 29 CFR part 97. Therefore, the provisions of those regulations applicable to
property requirements are incorporated into this section for governmental recipients and subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments provide that subrecipients
that are institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations will follow the Federal
agency regulations that implement OMB Circular A&hyph;110, as codified in DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 95 (59 FR
38270 (July 27, 1994), therefore, those requirements are also incorporated into this section for those types of entities.
It is expected that this approach will provide administrative relief for such subrecipients since it will prevent
an organization administering other Federal grants or subgrants from having to follow two different sets of requirements.
In addition, the Federal requirements applicable to intangible personal property have been incorporated into this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no Federal requirements generally applicable to commercial subrecipients; therefore, &sect;627.465(c)
provides specific JTPA requirements for these organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small number of commenters raised the question of whether prior approval by the Department of Labor is necessary
for property acquisitions. Language is added to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to waive any Department of Labor
prior approvals relative to property acquisitions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.465 specifically provides that the new rules apply only to property acquired after July 1, 1993. Several
commenters inquired about the rules applicable to property acquired prior to July 1, 1993. It was the Department's
intent in the interim final rule that such property would continue to be governed by the rules in effect at the time the
property was acquired. To ensure that this intent is explicit, the previous JTPA regulations on property are added
as a new paragraph (e) in the final rule. The only change is the citation for records retention requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JTPA regulations in effect prior to July 1, 1993, provided that the Governor was to maintain accountability for
property in accordance with State procedures, but applied three specific Federal requirements: (1) A reservation
of the Secretary's rights to such property; (2) record retention requirements; and (3) either reimbursement to the
JTPA program of the fair-market value for any unneeded JTPA acquired property retained for use in a non-JTPA program
or the use of proceeds from the sale of such property used for JTPA purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that the Department has no rights in property acquired with title II or III funds awarded to States
from the inception of JTPA in 1983 through July 1, 1993, but that the Department does have rights in property transferred
to JTPA from CETA. Therefore, as long as the proceeds from the sale of JTPA acquired property or the fair-market value
of such property transferred to other uses are expended for JTPA purposes and records maintained accordingly, the
Department views any further requirements governing such property to be the responsibility of the Governor. For
CETA-acquired property transferred to JTPA, the Department's rights in such property are specified in the current
Department regulations implementing the applicable OMB Circulars. Recipients and subrecipients are expected
to follow those regulations in disposing of CETA-acquired property.

Performance Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to adult and youth programs under title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and dislocated workers under title III,
&sect;627.470 provides for the establishment of performance standards for older worker programs under section
204(d) of the Act. The standards for both adults and youth may include standards for employment competencies which
are to be based on such factors as entry-level skills and other hiring requirements. The purpose of the performance
standards guidance set forth in these regulations is to establish the general requirements for implementing title
II&hyph;A, title II&hyph;C, and title III performance standards. Specific policy requirements will be developed
in consultation with the JTPA system and will be subject to a formal public comment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked when the new performance standards requirements would take effect. Current performance
standards measures and implementing provisions, as specified in TEGL's 10&hyph;89, 7&hyph;91, and 11&hyph;92,
will remain in effect through Program Year (PY) 1993. In accordance with the transition provision of section 701(b)
of the JTPA Amendments, revised performance standards were published July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35381 (July 11, 1994); standards
pertaining to 6-month retention in unsubsidized employment shall not take effect before July 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to setting 6-month retention standards, several commenters advised the Department to conduct a study to
identify and address technical issues related to using Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records to document placement
and retention of participants. In preparation for developing and implementing policy in this regard, the Department
of Labor has already undertaken a study to examine the technical and operational issues associated with the use of
UI wage records for the purpose of implementing performance standards related to employment retention. The study
was conducted in 16 States and focused on such issues as quality of data, timing for incentives, and out-of-State and
uncovered employment. The results of the study will be available in the fall of 1994 and will provide important input
into the decisionmaking process and guidelines for implementing the 6-month retention standard. The Department
recognizes that there will be a variety of issues to be addressed in developing and implementing a retention standard.
When the results of the study are available, the Department will work with State and local staff to introduce, wherever
feasible, alternative post-program measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is important to note that interim credit, which a few commenters believed should be incorporated in
the performance standards, will be considered in the development process. The Department emphasizes, however,
that there is no maximum participation limit and no Department-imposed requirement that everyone be terminated
at the end of a given program year. Performance standards are based only on those individuals who do, in fact, terminate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters provided advice on implementing the performance standards required under section 204(d)
of the Act, which implies that these standards are to parallel those developed for title II programs. While the specifics
of older worker performance standards will not be addressed in the regulations, the process for developing these
standards began in the summer of 1993. Program experts and advocate groups for older workers were consulted in developing
performance standards for older workers programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in response to other comments recommending adoption of performance standards for adults based on competency
attainment, it is important to note that skill acquisition for adults is included among several possible performance
standards factors identified in section 106(b)(3)(E) of the Act. In order to insure that any standards established
for skill acquisition are fair and practical, the Department has begun to collect relevant administrative data and
also to examine experience with youth employment competencies and initiatives, such as the Secretary's Commission
on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) and apprenticeship programs. In addition, beginning in 1994 the Department
will consult with academics and program practitioners to determine practical approaches to defining adult competencies.
Performance standards for adult skill acquisition will be issued in PY 1996, at the earliest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of the older worker program, the Governor is responsible for establishing an incentive policy
that rewards performance in title II programs and for: (1) Establishing a process for adjusting performance standards
to account for local conditions, and (2) providing technical assistance to SDA's which fail to meet performance standards
for a given program year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters voiced concern that a performance standard relating to costs might be required. Accordingly,
&sect;627.470(c)(2) is amended to clarify that Governors may not tie standards relating gross program expenditures
to performance measures in making incentive awards. Governors are encouraged to make full use of available expenditure
and participant data in monitoring SDA fiscal practices; at the same time, SDA's should closely monitor local service
providers. States and SDA's are encouraged to explore ways of relating overall costs of job training to long-term
employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulation also incorporates the requirement, in section 106(j) of the Act, for the imposition of a reorganization
plan on SDA's failing for 2 consecutive years to meet an appropriate proportion of the performance standards, with
the exception of the older worker programs. The Governor is to notify the Secretary and the SDA of the continued failure
and to impose a reorganization plan within 90 days of the end of the second program year; otherwise, the Secretary will
develop and impose the reorganization plan. As mentioned before, with regard to the 90-day deadline for imposing
sanctions, a few commenters believed that 90 days was insufficient time for States to evaluate and implement an effective
reorganization plan. In addition, a few commenters sought clarification of what might constitute the imposition
of a reorganization plan. The Department acknowledges that there may be some difficulty in timing but points to the
language in section 106(j)(5)(A) of the Act. In response to the latter comments and in an attempt to alleviate the level
of concern about the imposition of a reorganization plan, the final rule is amended by adding a new paragraph (c)(4)(iv)
to &sect;627.470 which provides the minimum requirements for the imposition of a reorganization plan. The Secretary
will give the Governor and the SDA 30 days in which to comment to the Secretary on the proposed reorganization plan prior
to its imposition. Further, the Secretary will recapture or withhold up to one-fifth of the State's administration
set-aside to provide technical assistance to an SDA where the Secretary has imposed the reorganization plan or where
the Governor has not provided appropriate technical assistance.

Oversight and Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received on oversight and monitoring. Section 627.475 summarizes the roles of each administrative
level in a comprehensive monitoring and oversight system. The monitoring provisions are expanded to require the
Governor to develop a monitoring plan which requires that each SDA and SSG be monitored at least once annually. The
plan must also require the collection and review of sufficient information to enable the Governor to determine whether
substate entities have demonstrated substantial compliance with the oversight requirement to permit a waiver of
the imposition of sanctions authorized under section 164(e) of the Act, or to determine whether a job training plan
should be disapproved pursuant to section 105 of the Act. The regulations also require the Governor to be responsible
for issuing standards to SDA's and SSG's for the development of a local monitoring plan. Additionally, the regulations
require the Governor to develop general standards for PIC oversight responsibility for inclusion in the Governor's
coordination and special services plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the Department of Labor provide greater details regarding its own monitoring responsibilities
as well as those of the States. The Department is in the process of developing guidance in this area and, when completed,
will provide more detailed information on monitoring and oversight through administrative issuances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter observed that the emphasis in paragraph (b)(3) was unnecessarily on criteria for disapproval of the
plan when, in fact, the Act called for the Governor to approve a plan unless it did not meet certain criteria. The commenter
suggested that paragraph (b)(3) be revised to read ``Determines that a job training plan shall be disapproved if the
plan does not meet the criteria established in section 105(b)(1) of the Act which states in part, the Governor shall
approve the job training plan or modification thereof unless he finds that the plan does meet the criteria found in
section 105(b)(1)''. The Department concurs with this comment and, although the Department did not adopt the suggestion

in toto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, paragraph (b)(3) is revised to better reflect the statutory criteria for disapproval of the job training plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested clarification of what elements of an SDA's and SSG's operation must be monitored not less
than once annually. The Department believes that an effective monitoring program is important to improving or maintaining
high levels of program performance. The Department wishes to provide states with flexibility in designing the nature
and extent of their monitoring programs while assuring that monitoring is thorough. Paragraph (b)(5) is revised
to indicate that all aspects of the SDA and SSG program must be reviewed annually, although the Department wishes to
clarify that the degree of emphasis placed upon the review of each area of a program may vary from year to year.

A few commenters expressed concern with the PIC responsibility for oversight as it relates to the Governor and the
chief elected official. The commenters suggested that the PIC should be allowed flexibility to determine the type
and amount of PIC oversight. Section 103(a) of the Act states that it shall be the responsibility of the PIC to provide
policy guidance for, and exercise oversight with respect to, activities under the job training plan for its SDA in
partnership with the unit or units of local government within its SDA. The Department agrees that it is primarily the
responsibility of the PIC to determine its monitoring and oversight role. While the regulations give the Governor
a role in PIC oversight in an overall context, the Department does not expect any guidelines issued by the Governor
to be overly prescriptive. Therefore, the PIC should have a great deal of flexibility in setting its monitoring role.
No change is made to the final regulation.

In reviewing the interim final regulations, the Department realized that it had not fully implemented section 164(b)
of the Act in the regulations. Sections 627.477 and 627.607 are added to complete the regulatory implementation of
section 164(b) regarding the Governor's actions where there are substantial violations of the Act or the regulations
and corrective actions have not been taken. Conforming changes have been made in &sect;&sect;627.601(b), 627.471(a)
and 627.702. These added provisions and changes are not intended to modify or expand on the plain meaning of the statute.

Because there are both non-profit and commercial organizations which are direct recipients of JTPA Title III program
funds, the language at &sect;627.480(a)(2) and (3) is modified by the addition of the term ``recipients'', as well
as by substituting the term ``organizations'' for ``subrecipient'' in paragraph (a)(2). The interim final regulations
implied that non-profit and commercial organizations can only be subrecipients.

Audits of Commercial Organizations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised questions concerning the audit requirement for ``commercial organizations''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wanted clarification concerning whether or not the audits of proprietary schools, which are required
by the U.S. Department of Education because of their involvement with Pell grants and other subsidies, would satisfy
the JTPA audit requirement. One commenter was concerned that the regulation did not provide a timeframe within which
these audits were to be completed, and another expressed concern that the requirement for an annual audit was more
frequent than that for non-profit institutions. The regulation, at &sect;627.480(a)(3), is amended to provide
for audit timeframes and frequencies that are consistent with the OMB Circular A&hyph;133 requirements for non-profit
organizations. This provision also provides the option of either a Federal funds audit or an organization-wide audit
as long as the audit includes financial and compliance coverage of the JTPA program within its scope. The option of
a Federal funds audit should be satisfied by the audit required by the U.S. Department of Education so long as it includes
financial and compliance coverage of the JTPA program within its scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested clarification concerning the audit requirement for OJT employers, commercial off-the-shelf
training packages, tuition-based individual referral contracts, and other ``vendor'' type arrangements. The
regulation imposes an audit requirement only on organizations that are ``subrecipients'' and not on those that are
``vendors''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked if the regulation prohibited a Governor (this would also apply to any awarding agency) from
procuring a program specific audit for commercial organizations and directing them to exclude JTPA from their organization-wide
audit. The regulation only talks to the requirement to have an audit done, not to who will procure and/or conduct the
audit. If the awarding agency and its subrecipient agree that the awarding agency will procure and/or conduct the
audit, the requirement of the regulation would be satisfied.

A few commenters had difficulty with the language at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.480(d). One of these commenters thought that the regulation went beyond OMB Circular A&hyph;128 and required
that debt collection be completed within the 6-month resolution period. This is not the case. When costs are disallowed
and debt collection is the appropriate sanction, those efforts should be initiated or started within the 6 month period.
This often is accomplished by including appropriate language in a final determination. However, the actual repayment
most often occurs after the 6-month resolution period. Also, debt collection efforts are often put on hold when a final
determination is appealed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these concerns, the parenthetical reference in paragraph (d)(2) is moved to the end, and the phrase ``where

One commenter pointed out a conflict between &sect;627.480(f) and &sect;627.704(a). Paragraph (f) is removed from

Stand-in Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were a number of commenters who raised concerns and questions about &sect;627.480(g), which is now redesignated
as paragraph (f). Several of these commenters were among those who commented on the definition of ``stand-in costs''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters indicated that stand-in costs should not have to be from the same cost category as the unallowable
costs. Others pointed out the discrepancy between the definition and this regulation concerning the time when such
costs were incurred. As a result, the last sentence of redesignated paragraph (f) is revised so that both it and the
definition at &sect;626.5 state that the costs are to be from the same program year and that the substitution cannot
result in a violation of the applicable cost limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that ``stand-in costs'' should be allowed as substitutes regardless of the year or program/title
that generates them. Such an interpretation runs counter to the intuitive concept of substituting to make whole the
program that bore the cost of the misexpenditures. It is also contrary to ETA's interpretation of the General Accounting
Office (GAO) Comptroller General decision which is the basis for the position on ``stand-in'' costs. The GAO-decision
indicates that, when an audit reveals total allowable program costs which exceed the total amount authorized and
paid with program funds, the resolving agency is obligated to accept those program costs as substitutes for disallowed
costs. This is true because funds which become available due to the disallowance of costs should be treated as funds
never expended by the auditee. Thus, the stand-in process constitutes a part of the totality of allowed and disallowed
costs which occurs at the audit resolution stage before a collectible debt is established. The regulation, at &sect;627.480(f),
is written to incorporate this concept of substitution for unallowable costs incurred by the auditee when the stand-in
costs are reported (on the JTPA quarterly financial report form) and accounted for in the auditee's financial system,
and are included within the scope of the auditee's audit report. Although potential stand-in costs are aggregated
for reporting purposes only, this does not create a pool of stand-in costs at the higher tier when funds are merely passed
through from one level to the next (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 State to SDA or other government entity). When ``stand-in'' costs are reported on the JTPA quarterly financial report
and included within the scope of an entity's audit, they are readily identifiable and available to substitute for
unallowable costs identified in the same report. This is important because by the time an audit report is finally resolved,
the three-year availability period for the costs disallowed has often lapsed or is nearing its end. By having contemporaneous
allowable JTPA costs incurred (but paid for with local resources) during the same period as the unallowable costs,
there is no question about the propriety of the substitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters raised questions concerning the requirement to report ``stand-in costs''. A few asked if they needed
to be reported on the quarterly reports required by the Department. One asked if these costs could be reported after
the fact only when needed, instead of being reported whether or not an SDA is permitted to and/or needs use them. Others
suggested that they should be allowed even if not reported. One suggested that the requirement to report exceeded
the statutory requirement that they be recorded. As explained above, it is ETA's position that ``stand-in costs''
must be subjected to audit coverage in order to be accepted. Imposing the requirement that the costs be reported and
providing a line for these costs on the JTPA quarterly financial report(s), insures that these costs are included
within the scope of the audit report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested that the JTPA compliance supplements for OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 audits
be revised to require that such audits include a separate schedule for ``stand-in costs'' and to specify the documentation
requirements for same. The documentation requirements, including retention requirements, are the same as for all
JTPA costs incurred. While the Department is not in a position to dictate whether A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 audits
include an additional schedule, when the compliance supplements are revised, it may be possible to suggest how ``stand-in
costs'' should be treated in such audits.

Direct Appeals by SDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that &sect;627.480(h) should be revised to provide the right of a direct appeal by an
SDA, especially in those instances when a State chooses not to appeal. However, the initial and final determination
process utilized by the ETA Grant Officer imposes a sanction on the direct recipient of funds from ETA, and it is that
recipient that ETA holds liable for the sanction. If the entity upon whom the sanction is imposed chooses not to appeal,
there is no dispute between that entity and ETA. If an appeal of a Grant Officer's final determination is taken, affected
subrecipients are permitted to intervene in the proceedings. An SDA has the right to appeal any adverse determination
against it within the State appeal system.

Audit Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.481 is not changed from the interim final regulations. One commenter suggested that &sect;627.481(a)(1)
should permit direct recipients to have 6 months within which to submit their resolution report. The Department believes
that to do so would mean that the recipient's audit would not be resolved with its awarding agency within the 6 months
required by the OMB Circulars. Another commenter suggested that the title for the paragraph at &sect;627.481(c)
should be State level audit resolution. However, this paragraph also applies to resolution beyond the State level
(e.g., the resolution of a service provider audit by an SDA). A third commenter suggested that the regulation at &sect;627.481(c)
should mandate that audit work papers be accessible to the auditee. Since these audits are procured by the auditee,
it is within their purview, and not the Department's, to include requirements concerning work papers in their agreement
with the auditors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Closeout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that waiting 3 years (the full period during which funds are available for expenditure) to
close out a grant that can be closed in 1 to 11/2 years is confusing and unnecessary. It was also stated that this provision
should allow closeout to occur as soon as all of the funds are expended or within 90 days after the end of the funding period.
A second commenter suggested that the word ``timely'' is a subjective term and that the provision should require closeout
to occur within 90 days after the end of the funding period, unless the deadline is extended. This same commenter indicated
that the regulation should be clear that closeouts are based on year of appropriation. Several of the comments indicated
an apparent misunderstanding that &sect;627.485 applies to subrecipient awards. In fact, this provision is intended
to inform the direct recipients of the Department's intention to close out each annual grant agreement within a short
period after the availability of the funds has lapsed. The Department has determined that it is much more appropriate
and less confusing to close out all of the annual JTPA grant agreements (described at &sect;627.405 as the funding
document for an individual program year's funds) at the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the language in the last sentence of paragraph (b) should allow for additional revisions,
as long as there is a good reason that is adequately documented; further, the commenter suggested such revisions could
be handled through an increase or decrease in the ``carryover'' amount. The first sentence of the paragraph allows
for a 90-day period within which revisions may be made without a requirement for justification. The second sentence
allows the Grant Officer to extend the period for revisions if the recipient requests an extension and provides a justification
for same. The Department sees no need for any change to this provision. Also, at the end of the three-year funding period,
there are no ``carryover'' funds, only funds for which the three-year availability has lapsed. These funds must be
returned in accordance with paragraph (c) if they have been drawn down, and will be deobligated by ETA.

Later Disallowances and Adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the final rule should identify the period within which the Grant Officer has the authority
to disallow costs. Such an action is not necessary. If an audit or review is conducted while the records are still available
in accordance with the requirements of &sect;627.460 (i.e., 3 years after submittal of the final expenditure report
for the funding period) and there are unallowable costs, then the Grant Officer can disallow those costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Amounts Due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that this provision must acknowledge that there are processes at the local level which impede
collection of disallowed costs and which prohibit collection efforts by the Federal Government (or State) during
the time when the State (or local) collection actions are in process. Other sections of these regulations (e.g., &sect;627.485)
contain provisions which allow recipients to request additional time to complete such a process. However, once a
Federal debt is established against a recipient, it is that direct recipient which the Department holds liable. The
provision is not changed.

Grievances and Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule revised, redesignated, and reordered the regulatory provisions formerly found at 20 CFR part
29, Subpart D_``Grievances, Investigations, and Hearings'' in a new part 627, subparts E, F, G, and H. The interim
final regulations more clearly defined the various JTPA grievance procedures required to be established by section
144 of the Act. The procedures applicable to a particular grievance process level were consolidated into discrete
subparts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart E_Grievance Procedures at the State and Local Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new part 627, subpart E, sets forth the grievance procedures required at the State and SDA and SSG levels, including
State review, that were generally found at 20 CFR 629.52. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the reference to the handling of complaints alleging discrimination in &sect;627.500(a)
be made a separate paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the suggestion and &sect;627.500 is revised to redesignate the last sentence in paragraph
(a) as a new paragraph (b), Handling of discrimination complaints. In addition, paragraphs (b) and (c) are redesignated
as paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter observed that under the previous regulations, complaints involving fraud, waste, abuse, or criminal
activity were to be reported to the Secretary, and that &sect;627.500(b) of the interim final regulations now provides
that such complaints are to be reported to the DOL OIG. The commenter's concern was that ETA might not be aware of, but
had a need to know of, such complaints, and recommended that the regulations be amended to also include notification
to ETA for such complaints. Another commenter suggested that complaints be reported concurrently to ETA and the OIG.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the interim final regulations was to ensure that criminal activity was directed to the OIG for resolution.
Other processes set forth in the regulations for the handling of complaints are designed for non-criminal JTPA complaints.
The provision at &sect;627.500(b) is amended to provide for reporting criminal activity to the OIG, Office of Investigations
through the Department's Incident Reporting System, with a copy simultaneously provided to ETA. Other non-criminal
complaints will continue to be handled under the procedures set forth at part 627, subparts E and F, and through the
Department's Incident Reporting System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended deleting &sect;627.500(c)(2) concerning a private right of action with respect to alleged
violations of JTPA statute or regulations in pursuing non-JTPA remedies since there is no statutory authority for
the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision at &sect;627.500(c)(2) is not a new provision. Prior to the interim final rule, it was set forth at 20
CFR 629.51(b)(3) since the March 15, 1983 regulations implementing JTPA. It does not preclude a private right of action
if one exists, but rather indicates that nothing in the Act or in the regulations creates such a right. No change is made
to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that States, SDA's, and SSG's be required to develop their grievance procedures in such a
way as to broadly inform participants under the JTPA system of their rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the Act and regulations clearly set out the broad outlines of the grievance, hearings,
and appeal rights under JTPA for interested parties. The specific complaint and grievance procedures to be followed
are appropriately developed at the State and local level in accordance with the provisions of the Act and these regulations.
Such procedures are routinely made available to participants upon entering the program, and to subrecipients and
other interested parties. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that States should be required to establish timeframes for resolving complaints and recommended
a 60-day time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects that State, SDA and SSG grievance procedures already address this issue as an integral and
necessary part of their procedures. In any case, the regulations already include a 60-day time period at &sect;&sect;627.502(c)
and 627.503 (a) and (c) of the interim final rule. Therefore, no change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that a neutral third party be included in the grievance processes at the State level under
&sect;627.501, and the SDA and SSG level under &sect;627.502, to hear and act upon complaints. In addition, the commenter
suggested that programs should be encouraged to take advantage of recent Federal initiatives related to mediation
of disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final regulations already provide for the use of neutrals in the JTPA grievance process in certain situations.
For instance, such use is included in binding arbitration proceedings under the alternate procedure for handling
labor standards violation under section 144 of the Act, and the alternative dispute resolution provisions at &sect;627.805
available to parties to a complaint under &sect;627.801, Procedures for filing a request for hearing. The regulations
also provide for an independent review of complaints at the State level pursuant to the provisions at &sect;627.503.
No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended increased DOL participation in monitoring and handling complaint processes at the State
and SDA and SSG levels, including regular participation in grievance hearings.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grievance procedures established pursuant to section 144 of the Act, and set forth at &sect;&sect;627.501 and
627.502 of the interim final rule, are intended to ensure due process and to provide for the timely and orderly processing
of JTPA complaints at the State and local levels. The regulations also provide for a State-level review of local grievances,
as set forth at &sect;627.503. There is also provision for Federal-level review of State and local-level complaints
without decision at &sect;&sect;627.601(a) and 627.605. It would be premature and improper to interject the Department
into a State or local grievance process before it is completed. It would also create problems in the event that the Department
was subsequently requested to review a complaint in which it had participated. The Department believes that the regulations
set forth in the interim final rule are appropriate and consistent with the legislative provisions. Therefore, no
change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that the time period for requesting a State-level review of a local complaint, provided under
&sect;627.503(c) of the interim final rule, be increased from 10 and 15 days to 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statutory provisions at section 144, and the regulatory provisions at part 627, subparts E, F, G and H, the
grievance procedures established at the various levels are intended to provide the speedy processing of filed complaints.
The Department believes that the timeframes established in the regulations are consistent with the statutory scheme.
No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended including examples of independent reviewers at &sect;627.503(b) pertaining to State level
review of complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not believe that it is appropriate to include a laundry list of examples of possible independent
reviewers in the regulations, but agrees that some clarification in this area is warranted. Section 627.503(b) is
amended in the final rule to indicate that independent review should be conducted by a reviewer who is not connected
with the JTPA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended amending the employer-level grievance provisions at &sect;627.504 to indicate that if
an employer is required to use grievance procedures under a covered collective bargaining agreement, then those
should be the operative procedures for the handling of JTPA complaints at that level. In addition, it was recommended
that if no collective bargaining agreement exists, participants should be made fully aware of their rights to file
a grievance either by using the employer's grievance procedures or the SDA's JTPA grievance procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that where the employer is required to follow a certain grievance procedure under the provisions
of a collective bargaining agreement, those procedures should be followed for complaints pertaining to the terms
and conditions of employment of JTPA participants, therefore, &sect;627.504(b) is revised accordingly. The regulations
provide that recipients, SDA's and SSG's shall ensure that employers have grievance procedures available to their
JTPA participants. Some commenters suggested that participants be permitted to choose a grievance procedure under
which to process a complaint. The regulations indicate that employers of JTPA participants may elect to operate their
own grievance procedures or use the recipient's, SDA's or SSG's grievance procedures established pursuant to section
144 of the Act. The employer must inform participants of the procedures they are to follow when they begin employment.
The choice of which grievance procedure to follow does not extend to the individual participants. Since the relationship
exists between the employer and the JTPA entity in the first instance, it is important that all of the procedures and
provisions applicable to a given employer, including grievance procedures, are clearly established in the agreement.
The Department believes that the existing regulatory provision is consistent with the provisions of the Act, avoids
potential confusion that could result from the recommended change, and provides for the consistent treatment and
processing of JTPA complaints at the employer level. No change is made to the final rule.

Subpart F_Federal Handling of Non-criminal Complaints and Other Allegations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommended that the reference to the handling of discrimination complaints at 20 CFR 627.600 be made
a separate paragraph. The Department agrees with this recommendation and is amending the final regulations to redesignate
the first two sentences of &sect;627.600 as paragraph (a), and the last sentence, pertaining to discrimination complaints,
as paragraph (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended revising &sect;627.601, noting that section authorizes the receipt of complaints at the
Federal level without mention of the statutory preconditions for such acceptance that are partially explained in
paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(5) of that section. Further, the commenter argued that although some of the preconditions
for acceptance of a complaint at the Federal level appear in later sections of the regulations, &sect;627.601, as
written, is unauthorized by the Act and is misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions at &sect;627.601 are not intended, by themselves, to spell out all of the preconditions that apply
to the various complaints and allegations that may be filed at the Federal level, but rather are intended to indicate
the types of such complaints that may be received and the options available to the Secretary for the handling of such
complaints. The provisions that apply to the Federal handling of non-criminal complaints and other allegations
are set out in all of subpart F and must be viewed in their entirety to determine how they apply. The various sections
in subpart F either include the preconditions for filing a complaint or cite other provisions of the Act and/or JTPA
regulations which spell out such preconditions. The Department believes that the regulatory provisions are consistent
with, and accurately reflect, the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that, under the provision at &sect;627.601, the Governor does not have final determination
authority in any complaint because the regulations specify that Federal level reviews may include all of paragraph
(a), which includes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
violation of the Act, and recommended that the final rule provide clarification in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations, at &sect;627.503(d), provide that, with the exception of complaints alleging violations of the
labor standards at section 143 of the Act, the Governor's decision is final unless the Secretary exercises the authority
for Federal-level review set forth at &sect;627.601 of the interim final regulations. The provisions at &sect;627.601(a)
reserve the Secretary's authority to receive and review complaints alleging a specific violation of the Act and/or
JTPA regulations, notwithstanding resolution of a complaint under procedures at a lower level. Upon receipt, the
Secretary may handle such complaints, as set forth at paragraph (b) of that section. The Department believes that
the regulations accurately reflect the Secretary's and Governor's authority in this area and that further clarification
in the regulations is not needed. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that, in the remedies available for labor standards violations, &sect;627.603(c)(3) refers to
``back pay,'' and paragraph (d)(2) of that section refers to ``lost wages'' and asked for a definition of these terms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final regulations incorporated the statutory language pertaining to remedies for labor standards violations
at section 143(f) of the Act, which includes these two terms. The Department believes that, from a practical standpoint,
there is no difference in these two terms. Both terms refer generically to ``compensation'' in the context of appropriate
remedies; under paragraph (c)(3), wages are not an available remedy, while they are an available remedy under paragraph
(d)(2). In applying a remedy, these terms would refer to the amount of compensation (excluding benefits which are
separately provided for) that a person would have received had the violation not occurred. The Department believes
that the regulations are sufficiently clear and that further clarification is not needed. No change is made to the
final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter disagreed with the provision at &sect;627.603(b)(4) which provides that there is no ALJ review of the
Secretary's decision upholding the Governor's decision in complaints alleging section 143 labor standard violations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act, at section 144(d)(2), specifically provides that the Secretary may modify or reverse the Governor's decision
on a complaint alleging a labor standards violation, or issue a decision if no decision has been issued, only after
an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge of the Department of Labor. The opportunity for an
ALJ hearing is limited to actions by the Secretary to change a Governor's decision or to issue a decision as provided
for at section 144(d)(2) of the Act. The provisions at section 144(d)(3), pertaining to the Secretary upholding the
Governor's decision, specifically state that the Secretary's decision ``shall become the final decision of the
Secretary.'' The Department believes that the regulations accurately reflect, and implement, the provisions at
section 144(d) of the Act. No change is made to the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received on &sect;627.604 and no change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that under the provisions at &sect;627.605, Special Federal review of SDA and SSG-level
complaints without decision, where there has been no action on a complaint at the local level the Department should
not only act on the individual complaint, but also conduct a thorough review of the administrative capabilities of
the SDA/SSG. In addition, the Secretary should be prepared to impose more than just a sanction for failing to issue
a complaint decision, but also impose corrective actions up to and including reorganization of the SDA/SSG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision at &sect;627.605 pertains to actions that may be taken against the Governor for failing to provide a
decision as required at &sect;627.503(a) of the regulations. These actions may include imposing a sanction for failing
to issue a decision pursuant to the provisions at &sect;627.605(b). The right of the Secretary to review SDA/SSG operations
for compliance with the Act and applicable JTPA regulations is reserved at &sect;627.601(b) of the regulations.
The Department believes that the regulations provide adequate and appropriate procedures for the handling of complaints
alleging violations of the Act and JTPA regulations at the Federal, State, and SDA/SSG levels, consistent with implementing
the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter indicated that there were two paragraphs (d) in &sect;627.606. The second is now redesignated as paragraph
(e). Another commented that the correct reference in &sect;627.606(d)(2)(vii) should be subpart H. The final rule
is corrected. Also, the heading of &sect;627.606(c) is changed to read, ``

Subpart G_Sanctions for Violations of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liability of Units of Local Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters objected to the Department's singling out units of local government for bearing liability for funds
misexpended by their SDA/SSG. It is not the Department's intent to single out units of local government to bear liability,
but it is the Department's intent to make clear that neither a separately incorporated administrative entity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a PIC) nor a local unit of government can insulate (liability-proof) itself from responsibility for misexpended
funds. This is a more clearly expressed statement of the Department's position, and does not constitute a change in
policy or position. One commenter expressed full support for the provision while another thought it should be made
even stronger by requiring local government units to be held liable. The provision is not changed. The Department
encourages incorporated PIC's to be active participants in the delivery of JTPA services. To this end, the provisions
of &sect;628.415(b) indicate that the Governor's requirements on responsibility for JTPA funds may not, on their
face, preclude the selection of an incorporated PIC as the grant recipient.

Waiver of State Liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of a comment concerning &sect;627.480(f), discussed above, the second sentence of &sect;627.704(a)
is removed. It is replaced with two new paragraphs, (b)(1) and (b)(2), which address the timing of requests for waiver
of State liability. The remaining two paragraphs are redesignated as paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested that SDA's should be allowed to request waivers. Some indicated that such requests should
be made in conjunction with States, while others seemed to imply that such requests could be made directly, bypassing
the State. However, as indicated at &sect;627.702(e), it is the recipient that is held liable by ETA. Therefore, the
only liability that ETA can waive is the recipient's liability for the sanction imposed on it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the provision should be revised to permit a waiver in those instances where the
fraud was perpetrated against the recipient/subrecipient so as to avoid penalizing entities which discover, report,
investigate and prosecute the perpetrator of such fraud. Both this provision at &sect;627.704 and the provision
at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.706 Process for advance approval of a recipient's contemplated corrective actions are revised for such
situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Offset Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters expressed the belief that States would not request ``offset'' if it were limited to State-level administrative
funding. A commenter also indicated that most misexpenditures occur at the subrecipient level and that, if it is not
a section 164(e)(1) violation, offset should be allowed at the level where the misexpenditure occurred. Another
suggested the need to be flexible after considering all of the circumstances in the individual case. Section 164(d)
of the Act indicates that offset may be ``against any other amounts to which the recipient is or may be entitled *&blank;*&blank;*.''
(Emphasis added) Under title II, the recipient must allocate 77 percent of the funds to SDA's and is entitled to retain
23 percent of the funds allotted for specifically identified activities. It is the Department's position that a reduction
in the funds available through the ``offset'' process should not adversely impact the delivery of training and services
to participants, nor the incentive grant and capacity building activities. Therefore, the Department believes
that only the title II five percent (5 percent) administrative funds to which the recipient is entitled should be available
for offset. Similar reasoning applies to the Department's restriction for title III funds. The Department fully
expects that recipients will seriously consider their options, and the consequences thereof, and will not make frivolous
use of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter indicated that use of the phrase, ``amounts chargeable'', in &sect;627.708(b), conveys the implication
that the administrative costs must be incurred before they can be ``offset''. This was not the Department's intent.
The provision is rewritten to indicate that ``offset'' may be against amounts allotted that are expected to be used
for recipient-level administrative costs.

Subpart H_Hearings by the Office of Administrative Law Judges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommended amending the regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.800(a) to include Grant Officer Final Determinations made pursuant to &sect;627.606 under the ALJ hearing
process in addition to those specified at section 166(a) arising in connection with alleged violations of sections
141(c), 144 (d) and (e), 164(f) and 167 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 166(a) of the Act provides that an ALJ hearing may be requested by any recipient upon whom a corrective action
or sanction has been imposed by the Secretary. By definition this would include final determinations made by the Grant
Officer. The Department believes that the general provision included in section 166(a) of the Act is sufficiently
clear in establishing the jurisdiction of the ALJ and that further clarification is not needed. No change is made to
the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter objected to the restrictions placed on the jurisdiction of the OALJ regarding specific sections of the
law which the commenter believes will reduce the opportunity for complainants to have full redress of their grievances
at the highest levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OALJ coverage is as provided for at section 166 of the Act, and set forth at &sect;627.800 of the interim final regulations.
As noted in the response to the preceding comment, the OALJ's jurisdiction includes more than just the specific sections
cited at section 166(a) of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter raised some concerns regarding the entities specified at &sect;627.801(a) that may request an ALJ hearing
based on a Grant Officer's final determination which imposes a sanction, a corrective action, or denies financial
assistance. It was correctly suggested that the Grant Officer might issue a sanction upon a ``vendor'' and paragraph
(a) is amended to cover such situations. A commenter recommended that the provisions at &sect;627.801(a) pertaining
to procedures for filing a request for an ALJ hearing could be made clear that a request for a hearing must be submitted
by certified mail, by changing the words ``may transmit by certified mail'' to ``must transmit by certified mail.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the provision at &sect;627.801(a) of the interim final regulations seems to indicate
that the use of certified mail to transmit a request for a ALJ hearing is discretionary, which was not intended. The
provision at &sect;627.801(a) is amended to indicate that the Grant Officer's final determination to impose a sanction
or corrective action, or to deny financial assistance 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be appealed to the OALJ within 21 days of receipt of the final determination, and that a request for a hearing shall be
transmitted by certified mail, return receipt requested to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has reviewed &sect;627.802(e) in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
114 S.Ct. 2251, 62 U.S.L.W. 4543 (June 20, 1994) which addresses the allocation of burden of proof in cases governed
by &sect;7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act and has concluded that no change in this section is required. In
Greenwich Collieries, the Supreme Court concluded that a claimant for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act
was the ``proponent of a rule or order'' under section 7(c) of the APA and, as such, carried the burden of persuasion.
Section 627.802(e) of these regulations is predicated on the fact that in appeals from Grant Officer Final Determinations
the grantee is the proponent of the rule since, in the absence of an appeal, the Final Determination would represent
a final debt due and owing the United States. The grantee seeking to avoid this outcome is clearly the ``proponent of
the rule or order.'' This construction is also consistent with section 165 of the Act which places on grantees the affirmative
obligation to maintain adequate documentation to prove the allowability of costs incurred. While the grantee has
the burden of persuasion, in our desire to ensure orderly presentation of evidence, the Grant Officer retains the
obligation to prepare and present the administrative file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a few of the commenters noted typographical errors or incorrect statutory and/or regulatory citations
in part 627, subparts E, F, G, and H which are corrected in the final rule.

Subpart I_Transition and Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 3, 1993, the interim final rule was amended to revise the transition provisions at part 627, subpart I (58 FR
31471). Those requirements are restated in the final rule, along with the addition of a definition of ``initiation
of procurement'' (&sect;627.904(e)) and a provision for the transfer of summer program funds (&sect;627.904(k)(2)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of general comments were received on the difficulties and uncertainties of the transition to the new program
to be implemented on July 1, 1993 and whether the contents of the interim final rule adequately addressed a range of
questions on the transition. Subsequent to the publication of the interim final rule on December 29, 1992, the Department
conducted implementation training for the States in February and March of 1992, provided transition guidance in
Training and Employment Guidance Letter 7&hyph;92 on March 8, 1993, and issued two sets of questions and answers on
the transition and interim final rule to the Department of Labor regional offices by Field Memorandum that were widely
circulated throughout the JTPA system. The Department believes that these mechanisms with the additional guidance
reflected in the June 3, 1993

Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;235) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act includes a series of amendments to the JTPA. NEW's purposes are
to provide a wider range of training opportunities for women under existing JTPA programs; to provide incentives
for the establishment of programs that train, place, and retain women in nontraditional fields; and to facilitate
coordination of JTPA and vocational education resources available for training and placing women in nontraditional
employment. Further, the NEW Act is consistent with the overall goal of JTPA programs to increase participants' employment,
earnings, educational and occupational skills. This separate discussion of the NEW Act is provided as a reminder
to States and SDAs of the importance of efforts to train and place women in nontraditional employment and the emphasis
the Department places on such efforts. There are contained in the final rule various references to the requirements
pertaining to nontraditional employment for women, especially as they pertain to planning and setting goals, the
assessment process and development of the individual service strategy, and to the various reports required by the
Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Nontraditional employment'' is defined in the NEW Act as occupations or fields of work where women comprise less
than 25 percent of the individuals employed in such occupation or field of work. Although nontraditional occupations
are usually thought of only as construction or skilled trades, these occupations encompass a much broader spectrum
of jobs, including those in technical and other fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontraditional occupations have the potential for greatly improving the economic status of women, particularly
when they are growth occupations with increased wage potential. Nontraditional training for women also provides
benefits for the States and the SDA's. The Department believes that this kind of training expands the occupational
mix available to all customers, and can enhance coordination with other education and training programs, as well
as with labor and apprenticeship programs. It helps advance efforts by the States and/or SDA's to be a valuable source
of trained individuals for employers and unions. Through the implementation of NEW, it is the Department's intent
that changes will occur throughout the job training system so that training in nontraditional occupations becomes
institutionalized in each State. The GCSSP and the job training plan prepared by each SDA were required to include
goals, actions, and accomplishments for the training and placement of women in nontraditional employment for the
2-year period beginning July 1, 1992 and beyond. NEW does not establish specific numerical goals by SDA or State. However,
using General Accounting Office data (GAS/HRD&hyph;89&hyph;152FS, September 1989), the Department estimates
that the proportion of women currently trained by JTPA in nontraditional occupations nationwide is about 9 percent.
Therefore, at their option, States and SDA's may use this figure as a substitute for a particular State's baseline
until they can collect data specific to that State. States should strive for a goal for training and placing more than
9 percent of women participants in nontraditional occupations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects that the GCSSP and the SDA's job training plan will reflect specific measurable activities
to train and to place women in nontraditional employment and apprenticeships, as required by the statute. As mentioned
earlier, SDA's may wish to consider using the national figure of 9 percent as an indication of the pre-NEW level of nontraditional
training until geographic-specific data becomes available. Sections 104(b)(6) and (13), 121(b)(3) and 122(b)(5)&hyph;(7)
of the Act require the States and SDA's to set goals and report on program accomplishments. The Department intends
to look closely at these activities to ensure compliance with requirements of NEW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department expects that each State's and SDA's plans and activities will reflect the development of
outreach and promotional materials and/or activities aimed at making women aware of the programs and the services
available through JTPA, particularly of nontraditional training and placement opportunities. Examples of outreach
materials include, but are not limited to, nontraditional career information modules, video and print materials
on nontraditional career options (for counselors), recruitment brochures targeted at both the customer and the
employer, and dissemination of preexisting resource materials and/or model curricula. States may also wish to undertake
statewide public education campaigns, similar to those conducted for literacy programs, on nontraditional training
and employment opportunities. The Department expects statewide dissemination of model programs/approaches to
serve as a method of encouraging the replication and institutionalization of nontraditional training in the State.
The Department encourages the States to disseminate to SDA's and service providers the SJTCC's summary report on
promising programs funded by JTPA or the Carl Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comments that pertained to NEW sought to add to the regulations a number of specific requirements regarding
services to women and focussed on nontraditional employment. These suggested requirements ranged from language
to requiring OJT goals for women in nontraditional employment, as well as standards for OJT contracts, to specific
procurement requirements as they pertain to women-owned businesses, and specific monitoring requirements. The
Department believes that many of these ideas have merit but does not believe that it is appropriate to establish them
as Federal regulatory requirements beyond that which would otherwise be required by the provisions of the Act_particularly
as the Federal Government looks to reduce administrative requirements. On the other hand, a commenter suggested
that the regulations ought to reflect the statutory requirements. The Department is persuaded that the NEW's requirements
should be emphasized by referencing them, as appropriate, in the regulations and has done so in appropriate sections,
including: &sect;627.455, for the annual report to the Governor that is to be described in the job training plan; &sect;628.205,
pertaining to the State goals for the training and training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment
and apprenticeships; &sect;628.210, for the responsibility of the SJTCC to review and analyze the annual reports
of SDA's and to distribute them in the State and to the Secretary; and &sect;628.420, for the SDA's local goals for the
training and training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment. These are not new regulatory requirements;
rather they are reflections of statutory requirements.

Several comments were received on the Governor's coordination and special services plans. Section 628.205(c) of
the interim final regulations required the States to provide their respective SDA's prior to December 31 of the year
preceding the program years for which the plan is developed, information on its plans to undertake State activities
in program areas, including education coordination and services to older workers, and capacity building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested removal of the December 31 date. The commenters suggested the language be revised to
say that the State should issue this information to SDA's in sufficient time for them to be able to take it into consideration
in developing plans. The Department agrees with the commenters and this change is made to the final regulations in
a new paragraph (c)(2).

that this would be a good step. However, since JOBS representatives can be included within the meaning of ``representatives

Several commenters were concerned that the regulations did not require, or at least encourage, that membership on
the SJTCC or the HRIC include the State Agency on Aging or a designee to ensure that the needs of older workers are addressed.
It was stressed that such representation on these councils would improve the commitment to older workers and promote
the development of integrated service systems for older workers. The Department agrees that the needs of older individuals
should be addressed in the provision of JTPA services; however, in interpreting requirements of the Act at sections
122(a)(3)(B)(i)(SJTCC) and 702(b)(5)(HRIC), the Department believes there is already sufficient latitude and
flexibility for the Governor to appoint a representative from the State Agency on Aging and further regulation is
not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that it would be helpful to clarify in paragraph (a) of the regulation that, when the State Council
on Vocational Education (SCOVE) is incorporated in the HRIC, the HRIC is responsible for carrying out the functions
of the SCOVE. The Department believes that this is clear in the provisions of the Act and in &sect;628.215(e) of the
regulations. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that, when the SCOVE is included within the HRIC, it would be beneficial to include the State
Director of vocational education on the HRIC since the State Director plays an important role in education within
each State, especially in coordination and improvement of educational services. The Department agrees and the final
rule at &sect;628.215(c) encourages the Governor to consider appointment of the State Director to the HRIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned the accounting basis for funds that are made available to the HRIC. Some wished to ensure
that when funds are made available to the council the statutory activities for which they are intended are accomplished.
Another commenter pointed out that the requirement to allocate funds on the basis of ``benefits received'' goes beyond
the requirements of the Act and the Conference Report, which simply specified that State agencies were encouraged
to provide funds in a manner consistent with their representation on the council and that no agency's contribution
be disproportionate. The Department has examined this issue and believes that the Act contemplates some flexibility
in terms of how the costs of the activities of the Council relate to the various applicable programs. This is particularly
true under circumstances in which there is a reasonable contribution on behalf of an applicable program. The Department
has determined that, as specified in the Conference Report, the costs of the Council may be allocated upon the basis
of the relationship of each funding source to the total funding of all applicable sources or programs that are represented
on the Council. Finally, on the condition that there is a reasonable contribution from other involved Federal and
State programs, the various activities of the council fall within the overall coordination mandates of the Act and
the related costs are allowable JTPA costs to the extent that JTPA funds are available from applicable JTPA sources.
The final rule is revised accordingly in paragraph (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify the requirement of paragraph (g) regarding the certification of the HRIC by the Governor, the final
rule is changed to indicate that the certification is to be in writing with a copy provided to the Secretary of Education.

A number of comments were received on State education coordination and grants found at &sect;628.315 of the interim
final regulations. In addition to the specific areas discussed below, the comments suggested confusion about the
administrative framework for the development of the section 123 program and the need for a general description of
the program. The section 123 program is to be a partnership between the JTPA program and the education system in the
State. The Act provides a strong role for the State education agency by requiring that funds be allocated to the agency,
and that the agency have a central role in planning and in the operation of the program. In order to foster coordination
at the State level, the Act requires that the Governor and the State education agency agree on the use of funds as part
of the joint development of the education part of the GCSSP. If there is no agreement, the regulations provide that
neither party may use the funds. To foster coordination at the local level, the Act requires the State education agency
to enter into agreements with the JTPA SDA administrative entities. If there is no agreement with the administrative
entity, the Act indicates that the amount of funds specified for the SDA in the State-level agreement may be unilaterally
used by the Governor for meeting the goals of section 123(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised concerns regarding the definition of State education agency. The commenters requested
that the final regulations specify that the Governor may allocate the 8 percent funds only to the State Education Agency,
as defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Department believes that clarification is needed.
The commenters argued that the definition of ``state educational agency'' in section 4(23) of the Act specifically
refers to the agency defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as the state education agency for JTPA purposes.
The Department interprets the Act differently. The term ``state educational agency'' is a different term from the
term ``state education agency,'' which is used in section 123(a) of the Act. The term defined in section 4 of the Act
is used in section 122(a)(3)(B)(1) of the Act to describe membership on the SJTCC. Support for the view that the terms
used in sections 4 and 123 of the Act are intended to be different is found in the use of the phrase ``any State education
agency'' in section 123(a). If the Department were to read this phrase to mean a single agency, the reading would render
the word ``any'' redundant. The Department reads section 123(a) to mean that, at a minimum, the Governor may consider
as the State education agency that agency responsible for primary and secondary education, or responsible for vocational
education programs under the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act and the Adult Education
Act. In addition, the Department finds that a number of States have consolidated a number of education functions and
agencies into various cabinet arrangements. For this reason, the Department has determined that the regulations
should retain the statutory language ``any education agency,'' but some changes are made in &sect;628.315(a) of
the final rule. The phrase ``or agencies'' is removed from the final rule because the Department does not intend to
cause confusion or appear to encourage the designation of multiple agencies; however, the rule should not be read
to absolutely prohibit this practice under justifiable circumstances when significant parts of the education function
are not within one agency. As previously reflected in the interim final rule, the Governor is not permitted to designate
any agency for which ``education'' is not the primary and operational function, which means that the entity must actually
be responsible for the operation of educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter questioned the conditions under which the State JTPA entity can be found eligible to be a subrecipient
of the 8-percent monies. The Act envisions the state education agency as receiving and using the section 123 funds.
The State JTPA entity is only eligible to be a subrecipient if the agreement with the Governor and State education agency
stipulates this as a part of the agreement. In response to the question of whether a portion of the funds may be used for

A commenter raised a concern regarding the time limit for negotiation between the Governor and the State education
agency when negotiating the joint agreement in accordance with the provisions found at &sect;628.315(b) of the interim
final regulations. While there is no specific time limit, the Department expects that the agreement would be in place
in time to allow for the expenditure of funds allotted for the designated program period. No change is made to the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether the State JTPA entity or the State education agency was responsible for the development
of the plan for the use of funds. The Department believes that the State education agency has the primary role in development
of the plan, but that the plan is to be developed jointly or in consultation. In practice, most arrangements for development
of the plan which are satisfactory to the parties will be accepted by the Department, so long as there is joint agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised concerns about the provision of the interim final rule that stipulates that when the Governor
and the State education agency fail to agree to develop a joint plan for use of the Education Coordination and Grants
funds ``the Governor shall not allocate funds under section 123(a)(1) to such education agency, nor shall such funds
be available for expenditure by the Governor''. The purpose of the rule is to indicate that neither party should benefit
from a failure to agree on the use of education coordination funds. The Department believes that this position is consistent
with the provisions of the Act that call for joint agreement between the Governor and the State education agency and,
therefore, no change is made to this section of the regulations. The Department wishes to clarify that this agreement
between the Governor and the State education agency is not the same as specified in section 123(e) between the State
education agency and the SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested that the barriers discussed in &sect;628.315(d) be defined. The barriers discussed in this
section are the same barriers that are specified under title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C of the Act or any additional barriers
the Governor may specify. No changes are made to this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter pointed out that &sect;628.315(d)(1)(i) of the interim final rule did not contain a citation to the provision
of title II&hyph;C authorizing funds for section 123 programs. The Department agrees and the final rule contains
that citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters inquired whether youth who are in compensatory education programs under chapter I of title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, who are found to meet the eligibility requirements for free lunch
under the National School Lunch Act, or who are in school-wide projects would fall within the meaning of economically
disadvantaged to satisfy the requirement to serve the disadvantaged. The Department believes that they do, and has
drafted the regulations to reflect the applicability of the eligibility criteria from one section or part of the Act
to other parts wherever practicable. So, for example, the final rule is revised, in &sect;628.315(d)(1)(ii), to
indicate that the criteria discussed above apply to the education coordination grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether &sect;628.315(d)(1)(iii) should refer directly to the non-economically disadvantaged.
Additionally, the commenters expressed concern that priority for these funds should be given to in-school projects
as opposed to Title III eligible participants. The interim final rule referenced non-economically disadvantaged.
The final rule is revised to reflect the statutory language, although the meaning is not changed. No change is made
to the regulations regarding the priority for Title III eligible participants since that priority is statutory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that the regulations should allow for direct allocation of State education coordination
and grants funds to the SDA. No change is made in the regulations since the Act is specific as it relates to the Governor
allocating funds to the State education agency and the State education agency being the entity that determines how
and where the funds will be distributed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned with the State matching requirements which changed the requirement from an 80
percent to a 100 percent match for Federal funds received for the State education coordination grants. These comments
do not appear to have recognized the change in statutory language wrought by the amendments. Prior to the amendments,
section 123(c) of the Act required only that matching funds be provided for three of the four kinds of projects specified
in section 123(a). The amended law, in section 123(a)(3), requires matching funds for all the kinds of projects specified.
Thus, while the matching requirement originally applied only to the kinds of projects to which 80 percent of the funds
available under section 123 were allotted, the law has been changed so that all funds are required to be matched. Similarly,
the language in section 123 describing the ``20%'' projects has been changed. The original language was that Federal
funds could be used to pay the cost of ``20%'' projects based on JTPA section 123(c)(2)(A). The new language is that
Federal funds may be used to pay the Federal share of ``20%'' projects based on JTPA section 123(d)(2)(A). The final
rule is revised to clarify that the matching requirement for the State is for an amount equal to the total of section
123 funds. Further, the rule clarifies that if there is no agreement between the State education agency and the administrative
entity in the SDA, the matching requirement does not apply.

Services to Older Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State set-aside program for older workers was incorporated into section 204(d) of the Act. Requirements for the
older workers program are set forth in &sect;628.320 of the interim final rule. The Governor continues to be responsible
for carrying out these programs pursuant to agreements with public agencies, PIC's, SDA's, non-profits or private
businesses. The Amendments require that, in entering into these agreements, the Governor is to give priority to organizations
which have a record of demonstrated effectiveness in serving older individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the final rule, the Older Americans Act was amended by Public Law 103&hyph;171 to revise
the eligibility criteria as they pertain to older workers served in JTPA programs. It provides, as had been the case
for the regular title II program (and as is reflected at &sect;628.605(e) of this rule), that older individuals participating
in joint programs with sponsors under title V of the Older Americans Act who are eligible under title V are deemed to
satisfy the requirements of section 203(a) of the Act. A new paragraph (d)(2) is added to &sect;628.320 to reflect
this amendment. It is important to recognize that a purpose of the Older Americans Act Amendments is to enable Senior
Community Service Employment Program participants who are in joint programs to participate in JTPA activities.
In response to questions concerning the nature of an agreement for a joint program between JTPA and the title V program
sponsor, the Department notes that, for purposes of both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;628.320(d)(2) and 628.605(e), the written agreement that sets forth the joint program should be structured
so that both the JTPA and the title V program provide services to participants consistent with the objective of the
participant and the resources of the participating program. For JTPA participants, services will be provided under
the ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned that the inclusion of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income in the
definition of ``family income'' severely limits the number of older individuals who are eligible for the program.
This issue is addressed under the definition of ``family income'' in &sect;626.5 of the final rule. The revised definition
clarifies the treatment of Social Security income and that Supplemental Security Income is not considered in the
calculation of family income. No change is made in this section of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters recommended the removal of limitations on job search assistance in &sect;628.535 as they might apply
to older workers. Job search assistance, including the application of the job search limitation restrictions as
they apply to older workers, is covered in the discussion of the job search limitations under &sect;628.535 elsewhere
in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters recommended that the Department define ``equitable basis'' as it relates to fund availability for
older worker services. The Department's view is that the definition of ``equitable basis'' will vary from State to
State based upon local circumstances and, therefore, the Governor should determine the basis upon which funds will
be distributed, taking into account the population of eligible older workers, their distribution throughout the
State, and the availability of resources for this population. However, in considering the question of whether funds
are distributed on an ``equitable basis'', the Department does not believe that all circumstances require that each
SDA or area within the State receive funds under this set-aside. Each State is to develop some reasonable measure,
including older individuals' share of the population or share of the labor force, in determining how these funds and
services will be provided throughout the State. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern that the performance standards for the older worker set-aside should be specifically
tailored to the unique needs of this population. As noted earlier in the discussion of the performance standards section,
the Department has convened a technical work group on the development of the new performance standards which includes
representatives of older workers, and will take these and other comments under consideration in developing performance
standards.

Capacity Building and Technical Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The JTPA has been amended to include capacity building and technical assistance as priorities at the national, State
and local levels for JTPA and other related human service programs. Section 453 of the Act calls for the creation of
a national Capacity Building and Information and Dissemination Network and a Replication Grant Program. State and
local priorities are established through sections 202(c)(2)(A) and 262(c)(2)(A) of the Act, which make available
up to 33 percent of the 5 percent incentive funds for capacity building and technical assistance activities. Section
121(a)(3) of the Act, requires that capacity building and technical assistance plans be included in the GCSSP. Greater
emphasis is placed on general technical assistance activities for the development and training of State, SDA, and
service provider staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments received on the interim final regulations supported the use of incentive funds for capacity
building and technical assistance activities and supported the need to develop the capacity of JTPA personnel at
all levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters requested that Private Industry Councils and other job training councils, as well as those who administer
JTPA, be included in capacity building activities. It was also requested that the inclusion of front-line staff be
made more evident. It is the Department's intent that capacity building and technical assistance activities be targeted
to all personnel who staff and administer JTPA at all level of the system. Section 628.325(c)(1) is revised to include
PIC's and other councils, as well as other related human service systems provided for in section 205(a) of the Act.
The word ``administer'' is added to the definition of capacity building at &sect;626.5, and ``front-line'' staff
are included in &sect;628.325(c)(2)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received requesting further clarification on the use of funds for the upgrade of Management Information
Systems (MIS). Section 628.325(c)(2)(iii) provides for the use of the 33 percent of the 5-percent incentive funds
authorized under the JTPA amendments for the purchase of hardware and/or software only if directly related to capacity
building and technical assistance activities of the National Capacity Building and Information Dissemination
Network (Network). These 5-percent funds may not be used exclusively for MIS; &sect;628.325(c)(2)(iii) sets forth
specific guidance on the purchase of hardware/ software. Funding for MIS redesign is addressed in Training and Employment
Information Notice 2&hyph;92, which provides for the use of PY 1992 6-percent incentive funds for MIS upgrading and
re-design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters continued to express concern that the non-duplication provision in section 202(c)(3)(B) of the
Act could seriously hamper State and local flexibility in developing products and delivering training. Section
628.325(c)(2)(iv) of the final regulations specifies that State and local capacity building efforts are to be coordinated
and integrated with the National Capacity Building Information Dissemination Network (Network), pursuant to sections
202(c)(3)(B) and 262(c)(3)(B) of the Act. In order to maximize funds available, the Network will build, to the extent
possible, on what already exists in the system. Through its clearinghouse, it will make information accessible to
the JTPA system on current and planned Network products so that duplication of effort may be avoided as States and SDA's
plan their capacity building agendas. Non-duplication should be viewed by the system as a means for maximizing scarce
resources and not as limiting the flexibility of States and SDA's to tailor Network products to their own needs and/or
to produce and train on similar or related products when local circumstances so dictate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the regulations mandate that the 33 percent of 5 percent incentive grant funds available
to the States for capacity building be passed to the SDA level for capacity building and technical assistance activities.
The final regulations continue to strongly encourage Governors to use these funds for the development of staff capabilities
at all levels, and particularly for front-line staff, through a comprehensive capacity building and technical assistance
strategy. While neither the Act nor the regulations require that funds be passed directly to the SDA's, the final regulations,
at &sect;628.325(c)(2)(ii), offer a variety of State options for ensuring coverage of SDA and front-line staff.
Section 628.205 encourages Governors to share capacity building plans in advance with SDA's and requires that capacity
building plans be included in the GCSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specific information was requested as to what related human service programs are covered under section 453 of
the Act. Section 628.325 (c)(1) and (d) includes those programs listed in section 205(a) of the Act among those human
service programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification on the allowable uses for incentive funds by SDA's, specifically asking
if there is any limit on the amount of incentive funds used for capacity building and if incentive funds can be used solely
for administration. One commenter suggested a maximum limit of 30% on the use of incentive funds for administration
in order to insure that their primary use focuses on training and capacity building. The Department intends to allow
the SDA's flexibility in determining how their incentive funds are best utilized. Section 627.440(c)(2) specifies
that incentive funds may be used without regard to cost limitations. However, a new paragraph (5) is added to &sect;628.325(b)
specifying that SDA's should use incentive funds for capacity building, technical assistance and services to eligible
participants. The former paragraphs (3) and (6) in &sect;628.325(b) which dealt with this topic are removed; the
remaining paragraphs are redesignated accordingly. Further clarification on SDA capacity building responsibilities
is also found in &sect;628.420, the Job Training Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SDA Designation Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final regulations, at &sect;628.405, clarified the SDA designation process. The language in the supplementary
information section indicated that SDA designations are to occur every 2 years, consistent with the preparation
of the 2-year GCSSP and the SDA job training plan. This information is incorrect and will be addressed in the context
of discussing the comments received in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also: established minimum criteria to be used by the Governor in considering discretionary SDA designation
requests under the provisions at section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act; provided clarification on the handling of competing
SDA designation requests under section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act; and defined the terms ``substantial portion'' and
``substantial part'' of a labor market area for the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii)
and (B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted that there was nothing at section 101 of the Act nor &sect;628.405(a) that indicates that SDA
designations are required to occur every two years, as indicated in the preamble of the interim final rule. The concerns
expressed in the comments were that to mandate that SDA's be designated every two years would be disruptive and would
serve to increase the number of SDA's rather than decrease them as intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters are correct that there is nothing in the Act nor the regulations that requires that SDA's be designated
by the Governor every two years. The preamble did not clearly convey the intent of the interim final regulations. The
intent of the preamble was to indicate that SDA designations, when they occurred, were to coincide with the 2-year
cycle for the GCSSP and the local job training plan. This was to clarify that SDA designations could not be made for an
off year of a 2-year period covered by the approved GCSSP and local job training plans. Section 628.405 is amended to
more clearly convey this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter indicated that SDA designation, under &sect;628.405(a)(3) of the interim final rule, should not be required
for a previously designated SDA which has complied with all of the JTPA mandates and has successfully operated good
training programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is nothing in the Act or interim final regulations that requires existing SDA's to formally apply for designation
or redesignation by the Governor when such designations are to be made within the State. Section 628.405(a)(3) only
indicates that the Governor should address the treatment of existing SDA's in the procedures developed to govern
the SDA designation process within the State. Thus, the Governor may choose to require reapplication for each designation
cycle or to permit existing SDA's to continue without the need for a new application. Section 628.405(a)(2) of the
interim final regulations is redesignated, in part, as (a)(3), and is amended to clarify this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters took exception to the requirement that the Governor establish standards by which to evaluate discretionary
SDA designation requests under section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act which, at a minimum, must include the criteria set
forth at &sect;628.405(d). These requirements are viewed as overly prescriptive, limiting the Governor's discretion
in making SDA designations and establishing a higher standard than that provided for in the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that neither the provisions of the Act nor the interim final regulations, at &sect;628.405(d),
inhibit the Governor from making discretionary SDA designations, pursuant to section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act. The
Department does not believe that the regulatory provisions are overly prescriptive in establishing some uniform
minimum standards for the Governor to evaluate such designation requests. With approximately one-third of the over
640 current SDA's being discretionary designations, it is necessary to ensure the viability of such SDA's to adequately
administer and promote effective delivery of JTPA services to a substantial portion of the eligible population in
the area to be served. The regulations simply formalize the minimum standards that Governors would need to consider
and, in most instances, probably already have established, in making discretionary SDA designations consistent
with the provisions at section 101 of the Act. The Department believes that the regulations in this area are consistent
with the provisions at section 101 of the Act and the Secretary's authority to promulgate regulations to implement
the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters took exception to defining ``substantial part'' and ``substantial portion'' of a labor market
area (LMA) for the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii) and (B) of the Act, respectively.
These commenters argue that the requirement that the prospective SDA serve 10 percent of the population of an LMA is
arbitrary, artificial and exceeds the language in the Act, unduly limiting the Governor's flexibility to determine
SDA's for the State. The commenters recommended that the 10-percent provision be withdrawn from the final rule. A
few of the commenters suggested including a ``grandfather'' provision for existing SDA's in the regulations, if
the 10-percent provision is not removed in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that prospective entities seeking SDA status under the provisions of section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii)
and (B) of the Act serve a substantial portion/part of an LMA as a statutory criteria for designation. In the past, the
Department has deferred to the Governor's definition of ``substantial'' for the purposes of such designations,
which has resulted in a wide range of thresholds being established, from levels significantly below the 10 percent
provided for in the regulations, to a majority of an LMA. The Department reached the 10-percent figure taking into
consideration the need for a rational figure which would assist the Governors in the SDA designation process and still
ensure the statutory mandate for serving a substantial portion or part of an LMA, as appropriate. The regulations
still provide that the Governor defines these terms, with the 10 percent floor as a minimum requirement. The Department
believes that the 10-percent figure is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of the Act and the Secretary's
authority to promulgate regulations implementing the Act, while still maintaining the Governor's flexibility
in designating SDA's. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the suggestion that existing SDA's be ``grandfathered'' notwithstanding the 10-percent requirement, part 627,
Subpart I, Transition Provisions, of the interim final rule addresses this issue. The regulation, at &sect;627.904(l),
indicates that, at the Governor's discretion, SDA's designated prior to July 1, 1992, need not be subject to the provisions
at &sect;628.405. The Department does not believe that further clarification is needed. No change is made to the final
rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 628.410 of the interim final rule set forth requirements relating to the establishment and functioning of
the PIC. Comments on the provisions of this section fell mainly into three areas: PIC recertification, joint agreement
on the plan for Wagner-Peyser activities of the employment service and PIC representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters questioned the requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.410(a)(2) that the Governor recertify the PIC biennially, one year prior to the date of submission of the
job training plan. The commenters indicated that this requirement was an undue administrative burden and appeared
to go beyond the provisions of section 102(g) of the Act, which states: ``The Governor shall certify a private industry
council if the Governor determines that its composition and appointments are consistent with this subsection.''
In response to this concern, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.410(a)(2) is amended to require the Governor to review the PIC certification biennially rather than to
formally recertify the PIC. The review process is intended to afford the Governor a continuing role in ensuring that
the PIC is an effective local policy making body. The requirements specified in &sect;628.410(a)(3) encompass three
areas: the PIC membership and the nomination process, the PIC/chief elected official agreement, and the responsibilities
of the PIC to carry out its role.

Several commenters indicated that the requirement for a new PIC/CEO agreement was beyond the requirements of the
Act and was potentially disruptive of agreements and arrangements that had been carefully and delicately worked
out at the inception of JTPA. There is no requirement to negotiate or renegotiate an otherwise satisfactory agreement
which is in place. The regulations only require the Governor to review the sufficiency of the PIC/CEO agreement in
terms of the requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments on &sect;628.410(a)(3) of the interim final rule which requested clarification of the meaning
of paragraph (a)(3)(iv), this paragraph is removed in the final rule, since it is largely redundant of the contents
of the PIC/CEO agreement and the material that follows in paragraph (b) which the Governor may review in the course
of normal oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked for clarification on the components of the Wagner-Peyser plan which were applicable to SDA's.
The SESA agreement requirements are set forth in the Wagner-Peyser Act, at section 8(b)(1). These requirements generally
deal with employment service operational plans for carrying out the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act which must
be developed jointly with the PIC and local chief elected official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding PIC membership selection, a few comments touched on the selection process for representatives of organized
labor. One comment asked that the regulations define ``labor federation'' to mean the AFL&hyph;CIO at the State and
local levels and that a process be instituted for the Chief Elected Official (CEO) to ensure PIC representation by
the local AFL&hyph;CIO rather than by individual workers. As provided in section 102(c)(3) of the Act, CEO's are to
consult recognized State and local labor federations for recommendations for the labor representatives to the PIC
and not an individual labor organization. For this reason, a description of the nomination process is specifically
required to be included in the PIC certification to be reviewed by the Governor. The Department agrees, however, that
there is a need for clarification as to what constitutes a labor federation and is adding language in the final rule,
at &sect;628.410(a)(3), to indicate that a labor federation is an alliance of two or more labor unions, an example
of which is the AFL&hyph;CIO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to PIC representation in general, several commenters stressed the importance of ensuring that the nomination
process is opened up to balance important interests in the community, including the interests of older individuals
and women. The Department recognizes the importance of balanced demographic and community interest representation
and sensitivity to the diverse populations being served. This sensitivity is best displayed at the local level where
the composition of the community is known. While the Department strongly encourages CEO's and PIC's to make every
effort to assure that PIC membership is broadly representative of the community, the Department does not believe
it is appropriate to require this result through national rules. Thus, the Department has decided not to impose membership
requirements beyond those enumerated in section 102 of the Act. In communities with public housing agencies, given
the similarities in target populations, the Department does, however, encourage chief elected officials to include
such representation in their PIC membership under the category of ``public assistance agency''.

A few commenters were concerned that appointing representatives of certain kinds of organizations to the PIC would
represent an inherent conflict of interest. Conflict of interest rules for PIC members are discussed in Procurement
(&sect;627.420(c)(4)).

Selection of SDA Grant Recipient and Administrative Entity

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that the intent of this section was unclear. The Department believes that the lack of clarity
may pertain to the kinds of criteria that the Governor may establish that would affect the PIC's and CEO's selection
of a grant recipient and administrative entity. The Act, at section 103(b)(1)(B), specifies entities that may be
selected as grant recipient and administrative entity, which may be the PIC, a unit of local government or a non-profit
organization. While the Governor may establish criteria for the selection of grant recipients and administrative
entities, the criteria may not specifically exclude a type of entity specified in the Act from being selected.

Job Training Plan

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 628.420 through 628.430 deal with the submission, review and approval of the job training plan. There were
a few comments regarding the contents of the job training plan which are addressed in &sect;628.420(b)(1), through
a reference to the requirements of section 104(b) of the Act. There were requests for certain specific references
in the text of the regulation. One comment requested that the requirements of the NEW Act be specifically referenced.
As previously discussed in this supplementary information section, the Department agrees and has added a reference
to the requirements of section 104(b)(7) in &sect;628.420(b)(1). Another commenter requested that a specific reference
be made to consultation with public housing agencies. While these agencies are not specifically referenced in section
104 of the Act, they are included among those agencies with which the SDA is to develop the coordination and linkage
arrangements that would be described pursuant to section 104(b)(4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters raised concerns about the requirement in paragraph (e) of &sect;628.420 that modifications are
to be submitted jointly by the PIC and chief elected officials (CEO's) to the Governor. These commenters appear to
be confusing modifications to the SDA job training plan with contract modifications. The commenters stated that
the procurement regulations in &sect;627.420 require that every contract change order, such as a decrease of one
participant, necessitates a contract modification. The procurement process requirements in &sect;627.420 do
not apply to the plan and plan modification process, and &sect;628.420(e) addresses the requirements for the modification
of the job training plan, not contract modifications. Language is added to paragraph (e) to clarify that a ``major''
modification is to be specified by the Governor. In so specifying, the Department suggests that the Governor consider
conditions which result in a variance of 20 percent from the approved plan in the budget, level of participant services,
number of participants served, participant outcomes, or other core elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, there was an inadvertent oversight in the interim final rule in &sect;628.420(d) and (e), concerning the
submission of local plans or plan modifications to the Governor. The interim final rule indicated that the plan or
plan modifications must be jointly submitted but omitted the statutory requirement that such plans or plan modifications
also must be jointly approved as a condition for submittal to the Governor. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of &sect;628.420
are amended to more accurately reflect the statutory provisions of section 103(d) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the time limit provided in &sect;628.426(b) for chief elected officials and the PIC
to correct any deficiencies the Governor identifies in disapproving a job training plan be changed from 20 days to
30 days to allow SDA's adequate time. This change is incorporated into the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a commenter requested that the final rule clarify that the references in the Act and regulations refer to
``working days''. In fact, this is not the case and the references, as is the practice, refer to consecutive calendar
days. No change is made in the final rule.

The Act contains significant requirements in the front-end operations for most SDA's, which will cause major alterations
in the intake structure and will necessitate revisions in the appraisal of each participant's capabilities, needs,
and occupational goals. In the final regulations, the Department has provided necessary direction based on the Amendments
and has clarified and highlighted significant changes from the ``old'' statute.

Eligibility Determination and Intake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two major criteria must be considered in the process of determining which applicants are eligible for title II JTPA
program services. As set forth in &sect;628.505, the first criterion is age. The second is economic disadvantage.
The standard for determining economic disadvantage will be income as described in the annual Department of Health
and Human Services poverty guidelines. The use of these guidelines provides a standardized income determination
across federally funded programs. The Department's approach to the eligibility determination process has been
to attempt to minimize the amount of documentation necessary to establish an individual's eligibility for services,
while maintaining the necessary safeguards to prevent misuse of program funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters encouraged a streamlining of the eligibility documentation process, including use of self-attestation.
Several requested guidance on what documentation would be required for barriers. The Department has issued, in February
1993, and provided training on an eligibility documentation TAG to be used by SDA's in the eligibility determination
process. This should provide clarification of these issues. The procedures in this title II, Eligibility Documentation
TAG, if followed by the SDA's, will protect them from audit disallowances based on inadequate documentation. In response
to several comments that the Department should stick by its guidance, the final rule clarifies the intent of the interim
final rule that when it is determined that the State, SDA or service provider followed the Department's written guidance,
the Grant Officer will not disallow costs related to required documentation of an individual's eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.510 describes the requirements for intake, targeting and referral of applicants. During the intake
process, personal data on individuals are collected and a preliminary determination regarding suitability for
title II services is made. A number of commenters expressed the need for clarification of the suitability issue. Suitability
for program participation is a determination, based on preliminary information, of which eligible applicants should
be considered for JTPA program services. This determination is made against the backdrop of the limited availability
of JTPA resources and services and the practical necessity that the JTPA program must decide which individuals fall
within the 5 to 10 percent of the eligible population that can be served. It includes a determination whether an individual
falls within a category targeted for service by virtue of having a ``barrier'' to employment and whether there are
other programs and services reasonably available to an individual within the community. The JTPA title II program
is not intended or structured to remove all barriers to employment that applicants for services may have. Therefore,
the suitability determination also should consider which eligible applicants, with the provision of locally available
supportive services, can best be served and benefit from JTPA participation by acquisition of educational and occupational
skills or competencies and eventual employment. The regulations provide that some limited assessment activities
may be undertaken, the results of which may be used in connection with a determination of suitability. A determination
that an individual may be eligible but not suitable results in referrals to other sources of assistance, provision
of information on other programs, or in the case of a service provider, in referral to the SDA for further consideration.
In making suitability determinations, SDA's should keep in mind their obligations under applicable civil rights
and equal opportunity laws. SDA's should consider advising applicants of the process and possible results of intake,
assessment and suitability determinations and, particularly, that not all eligible applicants can be served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to focus program services on harder to serve individuals, not less than 65 percent of participants must have
one or more barriers to employment, as specified at section 203(b) of the Act. SDA's may also specify an additional
barrier for each of the title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C programs. An example of an appropriate ``additional barrier''
under section 203(b)(7) of the Act was requested. In response to this request, the Department is providing several
examples, however, SDA's are not limited to these and are encouraged to develop ``additional barrier'' guidelines
tailored to local population and labor market needs. For communities with public housing, the Department believes
that ``public housing assistance recipients'' who are otherwise income eligible would constitute an appropriate
``additional barrier''. An employment-authorized refugee might be included, as well as a displaced homemaker,
or substance abuser. Finally, the Department counsels that a member of a group protected under the civil rights statutes
may not be designated as having a barrier to employment solely on the basis of the characteristics that cause them to
fall under the civil rights legislation. So, for example, a racial group could not be designated under the additional
barrier provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification of the documentation requirements for referrals in &sect;628.510(d).
The Department describes the minimum required documentation at &sect;628.510(d) and at &sect;628.530(c). The
Department expects that SDA's will develop standardized information on programs and services available in the community.
This information may be provided in written form to the eligible applicant. A record of the referral will be maintained
and may take the form of an incomplete ISS. No further followup is required beyond referral. Section 628.510(d) is
revised to incorporate this principle. The idea is that the SDA must assume some limited responsibility to eligible
applicants who come for services even though the Act recognizes that not all will be served. The SDA should be in a better
position than an individual applicant to be aware of the services available within the community and to make referrals
so that the applicant can benefit from these other sources. In part, this is a principle behind recent initiatives
by States, SDA's and the Department to facilitate a concept of ``one-stop'' service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;628.510(d) is amended to specifically mention referrals to Job Corps to parallel the amendment
to &sect;628.803(d)(2). This change is made to foster JTPA/Job Corps coordination.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 628.510(e) describes the requirement for service providers to refer eligible applicants or participants
who cannot be served by its program back to the SDA for further assessment, if necessary, and suitable referral to other
appropriate programs. Several commenters questioned whether there is a requirement for centralized intake. There
is no such requirement. The requirement is that the SDA put in place a system that works independently of an individual
service provider. This ``system'' would also cover situations described by commenters in which the SDA administrative
entity does not perform intake. In other words, an SDA must have some mechanism by which an eligible applicant or participant
can be considered for enrollment in all of the services available through the SDA, not just those of a single service
provider. The Department believes that this is a program design issue for local discretion and that there will be a
number of effective approaches to meet these requirements. The intent of the regulation is simply to assure that participants
will be exposed to the full range of available services and that they will have a fair opportunity to receive services
appropriate to their individual needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States and/or SDA's will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the targeting requirements of sections
203 and 263 of the Act and to determine actions to address noncompliance with the requirements. Many commenters questioned
how compliance would be calculated. Some noted that a strict reading of the Act would provide that any ``participant''
(i.e., any individual who has been determined eligible and received a service, including objective assessment)
could be included in the calculation to meet the targeting requirement. Others observed that while assessment was
an important activity, it did not necessarily constitute a training or employment service that would result in a measurable
outcome of the effectiveness of the program. In considering the comments, the Department recognizes that, at the
suggestion of individuals identifying implementation issues, it was determined that only individuals enrolled
in an activity subsequent to objective assessment would be included in performance standards calculations. The
rationale for that decision was that many individuals had not made a final decision to participate in the program and
have dropped out before any meaningful intervention. Therefore, for consistency, the Department has determined
that the 65-percent requirement also is to be calculated on those participants who receive services or training subsequent
to the objective assessment. Section 628.510 is revised to add a new paragraph (f)(2) to this effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Objective Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Objective assessment should be a continuous, customer-centered and flexible process. The objective assessment
should not be viewed as a discrete activity that begins and ends early in the stages of program participation, but rather
as one that will continue throughout participation in JTPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments received on the front-end design of the JTPA program discussed the assessment process. All supported
the concept and the intent of individualized program services. A few commenters expressed concern over staff development
needs for implementing assessment. Many commenters requested guidance in the development of assessment and service
strategies. While the Department expects that States and SDA's will retain authority for program design, technical
assistance has and will continue to be provided on assessment and development of the ISS. The Department encourages
use of funds for the capacity building of staff (see &sect;628.325), including staff training in objective assessment
techniques; however, the Department declines to establish credentialing standards as one commenter suggested.
The Department believes that staffing and standards should be a State and local decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters addressed confidentiality issues arising in the intake, assessment and referral processes. The
same kinds of concerns over disclosure of information were expressed in connection with the discussion of &sect;627.463.
The Department has not addressed confidentiality in &sect;627.515 because confidentiality issues are not new.
The Department thinks that traditional standards of professional conduct on confidentiality issues should be continued.
Further, the Department expects that protections against the disclosure of information that would constitute a
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, as permitted by section 165(a)(4)(B)(i) of the Act, will protect
the confidentiality of customer information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters expressed confusion over the determination of when an applicant becomes a participant, how
much assessment could be provided at the intake/ eligibility stage prior to enrollment of an eligible applicant and
to which cost category this would be charged. Costs incurred on behalf of an applicant, including intake, eligibility
and suitability determination (which may include some limited assessment of an applicant), and any assessment necessary
to facilitate the eligibility determination, consistent with the provisions of &sect;627.440(d)(3)(i) are to
be charged to the training-related and supportive services cost category. Once an applicant is determined to be eligible
and the decision made to enroll the applicant, a full objective assessment may begin and the applicant may receive
other program services. As specified in &sect;627.440(d)(1)(i), assessment at this stage may be charged to the direct
training cost category. Receipt of objective assessment or other services would confer participant status consistent
with the definition of participant in section 4(37) of the Act. The Department believes that the preoccupation with
participant status may be misplaced because the principal issue of program credit has been addressed in the context
of when the performance standards are to be applied.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department expects assessment of eligible applicants to be used only in those cases when an eligible applicant's
suitability for enrollment is unclear. While the regulations afford an opportunity to charge the costs of preliminary
assessment functions to the training-related and supportive services cost category to aid in the determination
of an applicant's suitability, the Department expects the restriction on the cost categories to act as a natural control
on SDA's while still allowing the flexibility for individual decisions. The Department would like to emphasize that
the limited availability of funds will restrict over-use of preliminary assessment as part of the decision to enroll.
SDA's are expected to finance intensive services expected to enable participants to complete successfully the longer
term JTPA service strategies within this cost category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.515 sets forth the requirements of the objective assessment. The scope of the objective assessment should
not be limited to only services or training programs already available in an SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether basic skills evaluation was required as part of the objective assessment. The
Department intends the evaluation to be of both basic and occupational skills. The definition of ``objective assessment''
in &sect;628.515(b)(1) is revised, therefore, to include basic as well as occupational skills evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective assessment is ongoing and should not be viewed as a one-time event. It should be a multi-faceted process
which includes a full array of options including items such as structured interviews, paper and pencil tests, performance
tests, behavioral observations, interest inventories, career guidance instruments, aptitude tests, and basic
skills tests. From these options, and others, assessment staff may select the most appropriate tools for each participant
to measure skills, abilities, aptitudes, interests, supportive service and financial needs, and to counsel participants
on how their assessment results relate to local labor market demands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SDA's are strongly encouraged to prudently select appropriate measuring tools that will provide necessary information
for the reasonable development of an individual service strategy leading to a realistic employment goal. JTPA resources
are limited and JTPA is not an entitlement program. The Department expects SDA's to develop practical applications
for career counseling and assessments for basic skills and occupational training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective assessment process should be sensitive to the testing and evaluation environment and the comfort and
confidence level of the participant. The temptation to over-test or over-evaluate, providing excess information
for which there is no immediate application, does not serve the customer's best interest, is detrimental to the customer/
counselor relationship, and is costly to the SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective assessment is to be revisited regularly and the resulting information used to amend the ISS, as appropriate,
when additional needs are identified or goals achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessments recently conducted by other human service programs or schools are viable options and their use is encouraged,
where appropriate, rather than requiring the customer to undergo additional assessments that duplicate information
already obtained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department notes that the objective assessment process for title II&hyph;B may be different in scope
than that for the regular title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C program, as indicated in &sect;628.515(b)(2). This may also
be the case for limited function programs (such as literacy programs) mounted under section 123, although this is
clearly an exception to the normal expectation in conducting an assessment.

Individual Service Strategy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 628.520 establishes the requirements for the Individual Service Strategy (ISS). The ISS is an individual
plan that is developed based on information obtained through the objective assessment. It is the framework within
which decisions regarding individual participants are recorded. It should be considered a living document that
reflects decisions concerning the appropriate mix and sequence of services to be provided leading to, and including,
a realistic employment goal. Several commenters requested clarification of the outcomes to be sought in the development
of the ISS for youth. The Department agrees that there is a need to focus on youth returning to or remaining in school
and, thus, that the ISS should focus more on education as it relates to a long term career. In title II&hyph;B and II&hyph;C,
the employment goal should be interpreted broadly for those individuals returning to school and may reflect long-term
career goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked for clarification of what had to be listed in the ISS. The ISS should briefly note any need for
financial resources or supportive services and record the amount of each. The expected outcome of each activity should
be indicated with a notation of the provision and schedule for each. Referral to other programs, and referral out of
title II must be noted on the ISS. The rationale or justification for other decisions may be referenced in the ISS, but
need not be recorded there. The Department provides further clarification of the use of the ISS for recording referrals
out of title II by revising &sect;628.530(c), as was requested by several commenters. This section now states that
further tracking or follow-up is not required for referrals out of title II. This section is also revised to correct
language in the interim final regulations that indicated referrals out of title II would not be calculated in performance
standards only if an ISS had not been completed. Since, as commenters noted, an ISS is to be developed for each participant,
this section now allows recording the referral in a partial ISS without any effect on performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters indicated confusion over counseling and the development of the job goal in the ISS. The provisions
of this section reflect the need for program-related application of career counseling, but the Department cautions
program operators to prudently provide career counseling related to the realistic goals of the JTPA program. While
the objective assessment/individual service strategy process is customer-centered, JTPA services are expected
to guide participants toward realistic employment goals for which training and job demand are available in the community.
Pure career counseling for its own sake should be left to other, more appropriate, sources. Development of a final
employment goal may be delayed where the objective assessment indicates a need for further career exploration or
assessment. In this case, a career cluster should temporarily be indicated in place of the employment goal. The ISS
should be revised to reflect the employment goal prior to the start of specific occupational skills training. The
employment goal may be revised if the continuing objective assessment indicates a need to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments were received concerning participant signatures on the ISS. This requirement was perceived
as an unnecessary administrative burden. Section 628.520(c) is revised to indicate that there is not a requirement
for a participant signature. However, the decisions reflected in the service strategy about goals, objectives and
services to be provided are to be made in partnership with the participant and are to be determined in conformance with
applicable civil rights provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Participant signatures on the ISS may be requested, but are not required to indicate the joint development of the document.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department encourages communication with participants and reminds program operators, especially program
monitors and auditors, that the intent of the ISS is to be a program tool and not a compliance document that forms the
basis for cost disallowance. The Department does not doubt that participant records, including the ISS, will be reviewed
to determine whether SDA's and others have adhered to certain requirements of the Act. This is unavoidable. However,
for the ISS to have the anticipated value as a program tool, it must not be developed and used with compliance in mind,
but rather with the needs of the customer as its focus. One commenter suggested that if documentation is required,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to document a payment decision, that it be recorded elsewhere in the participant record so that the ISS and compliance
documentation can be kept separate. While somewhat artificial, if this concept helps, the Department has no objection
to using it. Ultimately, however, the decision on how much detailed information to record on the ISS is one for States
and SDA's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule is revised by adding a new paragraph (h) in &sect;628.520 to emphasize that the ISS is a working record
of progress and references to ``documentation'' are revised to read ``record.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISS, to be effective, must be regularly reviewed and adjusted to reflect the progress and to meet the continuing
needs of each participant. The ISS will serve as the basis for the entire case management strategy. Case management
is an allowable direct training activity and the Department encourages its use as an effective strategy for providing
quality services to the participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters indicated confusion over the application of case management to the JTPA program. The Department
encourages application of case management principles to participant services. In section 4(32) of the Act, the term
case management is defined to mean the provision of a customer-centered approach in the delivery of services, designed
to prepare and coordinate comprehensive employment plans to ensure access to the necessary training and supportive
services, and to provide job and career counseling during program participation and after job placement. The Department
expects SDA's to make every reasonable effort to provide the services and training indicated by the assessment and
ISS and, where possible, to apply standard case management principles. The Department recognizes, however, that
JTPA is not an entitlement program and that not all services and training will be available regardless of the level
of coordination in an area. Case management is an administrative management tool, not an individual service to be
delivered to participants. There is no change in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters expressed concern over the ability to provide all services indicated by the objective assessment
and the ISS. Section 628.520(e) recognizes that an SDA may not always be able to provide the full array of services indicated
by the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS. In arranging for the mix and sequence of appropriate services,
it is fully expected that SDA's will refer participants to other programs for certain specified activities as part
of the JTPA service strategy. In those cases, particularly in rural areas, where services required are indicated
on the ISS and not available from any source in the SDA, such information is to be recorded in the ISS and an alternate
plan developed which may include referral to another program. SDA's are expected to make every reasonable effort
to make available the recommended training or services to each participant; however, consistent with &sect;628.525,
it is understood that the objective assessment and ISS do not give legal or entitlement rights to participants for
services. JTPA is not an entitlement program and available resources are limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters thought that language in the preamble to the interim final regulations authorized States and SDA's
not to serve the disabled or other hard-to-serve persons, if they needed substantial supportive services. The Department
acknowledges that it may have inadvertently suggested that an individual, with excessive supportive service needs,
such as a person with a disability, could automatically be referred out of the program to other sources. This is not
the case. Such decisions must be made on the basis of the individual's and the program's circumstances. While JTPA
is not required to directly serve every person, including every person with a disability, it is intended to focus more
on the hard-to-serve. The fact that an individual may be difficult or costly to serve should not, in itself, preclude
serving that person.

Consistent with &sect;628.520(f), service providers and contractors may conduct the objective assessment and
develop the ISS. It is the responsibility of the SDA administrative entity to ensure that the objective assessment
and the development of the ISS reflect the customer-centered approach required by law are provided to each participant
whether they are provided in-house or by service providers.

In response to comments on the provisions of &sect;628.510 and &sect;628.530, &sect;628.525 is also revised for

Referrals of Eligible Applicants and Participants to Other Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final regulations further clarify the subject of referrals of both eligible applicants and participants due
to confusion expressed by a number of commenters. The regulations, at &sect;628.510(d) and at &sect;628.530(c),
specify the requirements for referral of eligible applicants and participants for whom available title II services
are not deemed suitable or adequate to appropriate human service programs in the community. Section 628.510(d) deals
with the situation in which an eligible applicant is referred to non-title II services during the intake process.
Section 628.530 refers to referrals of participants, those individuals who have been determined to be eligible and
have begun to receive objective assessment or other services. In the final regulations, both provisions are revised
for clarity and to reduce the burden of documenting the referrals. Section 628.510(d) allows the SDA to conduct limited
assessment of eligible applicants as a part of a determination of suitability, before they are enrolled as participants.
The purpose of this pre-participation assessment is to enable SDA's to make more precise judgments as to the suitability
of the applicant for participation in JTPA and/or additional services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsibility of the SDA at this point in the intake process is to assure that eligible applicants not suitable
for title II participation are ``provided information on the full array of applicable or appropriate services that
are available.'' (Section 204(a)(2)(A) of the Act) and that necessary arrangements are made for individuals to make
contact with those services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.530(c) addresses referral of participants out of title II services. A number of commenters indicated
concern over burdensome paperwork requirements for referral of participants to other than title II programs. The
Department has addressed these concerns by amending &sect;628.320(c) to permit referral decisions for participants
with whom there will be no continuing relationship to be recorded in a partial ISS. No further tracking of such referred
participants is required. Of course, where there will be a continuing relationship with the referred participant,
&sect;628.530(a) provides that the referral decision should be recorded in the ISS and that the participant's progress
should be tracked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of service providers who discover that an eligible applicant cannot be served by its program, &sect;628.510(e)
requires that service providers refer such individuals to the SDA for further assessment and referral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clarification of referral responsibilities was requested by a number of commenters. In addition to the above explanations,
&sect;628.510(d) and &sect;628.530(c) are revised to specify that no follow-up is required for referrals of eligible
applicants or participants with whom there will not be a continuing relationship. Further, the Department wishes
to point out that either an applicant or a participant may be referred out of JTPA at any time, if warranted by customer
need or preference. Some commenters seemed to think that both an objective assessment and ISS ``must be completed''
prior to referral outside the program. Since both assessment and the ISS are presumed to be continually reviewed and
evolving during participation, this assumption is not warranted.

Job Search Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fundamental change in section 204(c)(2) of the Act regarding program design is the requirement that job search,
job clubs, and work experience activities be accompanied by other services that increase a participant's educational
and occupational skills. This change reflects evidence that, in some cases, suggests that quick turnaround placement
programs have minimal long-term impact when provided in isolation from other more comprehensive and intensive services.
The Department's Inspector General, in a 1988 report, concluded that the number of JTPA participants on public assistance
was only slightly reduced after completion of JTPA programs. On the other hand, The National JTPA Study found a 39%
earnings gain for adult women from the provision of stand alone job search services. This new limitation reflects
an overall thrust of JTPA to provide quality services to participants. For example, short-term job search assistance
alone might result in a job placement for low-skilled individuals, but job retention is not likely without concomitant
services aimed at increasing participants' needed basic or occupational skills. Accordingly, &sect;628.535 codifies
section 204(c)(2)(B) of the Act which limits the provision of stand-alone job search assistance, job search skills
training, and job club activities to title II participants. ``Job search assistance'' itself is defined in &sect;626.5.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments generally addressed two issues: Interfacing with the Employment Service (ES), and the preference of older
individuals for immediate job placement. With regard to the Employment Service, many questioned the ability of the
local ES office to provide adequate services to JTPA participants. They were concerned that ES may lack in-house expertise
to provide sufficient assistance for groups with special needs. Citing the provisions in the Act governing the determination
of duplicative services, several commenters believed that the ability of the ES office to provide assistance to special
needs groups should be a criterion for this determination. Others pointed out that, since job search activities are
a critical part of any ISS, and service providers have already established successful networks of employer contacts,
ES offices should not be the presumptive deliverer for providing adequate job search activities for all participants.
These commenters suggested that &sect;628.535(d) be either deleted or revised to permit SDA's to determine whether
to use the ES to provide job search services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, several commenters stated that allowing SDA's to determine unilaterally whether adequate job
search assistance is available through the local ES office (&sect;628.535(c)(2)) defeats one of the basic goals
of the Amendments: To focus JTPA on providing more training and less stand-alone job placement. Unless there is a mechanism
for ES input into the determination as to whether job search services are available, the concern is that an SDA could
simply assert that services are not available to avoid coordinating with the ES, leading to duplication. One suggestion
was that the Governor decide the criteria for the availability of job search assistance. Another commenter stated
that any requirement to document that job search services are unavailable from the ES for each participant or training
program should be done only once per program year or Job Training Plan cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter pointed out that because job search assistance was defined as a service ``designed to give a participant
skills in acquiring full-time employment,'' and the local job service office was considered the appropriate purveyor
of these skills (&sect;628.535(d)), this provision should be removed because ES offices may not always be able to
provide such services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department decided not to remove &sect;628.535(d) because it interprets section 204(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act
to accord the employment service a special status in terms of providing job search. Also, this provision of the Act
is not substantially different from the provisions of sections 107 and 141 of the Act which prohibit duplication of
services. It remains to be determined whether job search assistance is universally available within each community
from the Employment Service. The SDA may look at whether local employment service resources are sufficient to provide
the job search assistance for all potential JTPA referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, at &sect;628.535(d), is amended to indicate that a determination is to be made by the SDA in active consultation
with the employment service and other public agencies. These determinations must be documented in the SDA's job training
plan since the employment service is on the PIC and coordination with the employment service is among the topics to
be included in the plan. Standardized inquiries regarding local job search assistance availability from the employment
service may be developed by the Governor in consultation with the State ES Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters representing older workers recommended either a waiver of the stand-alone job search limitations
for this population or a provision allowing the Governor to request a waiver when sufficient evidence demonstrates
that the interests of older workers would not be well served by these limitations. These commenters recognized the
priority placed on training for younger individuals but expressed doubts that career training was a realistic and
relevant goal for older workers who, generally are not attracted to long-term assistance that mandates skills training,
who do not thrive in classroom training designed for youth and young adults, and who do not tend to seek assistance from
the ES or other public agency environments. For these reasons, several commenters asked that older workers, or the
older worker set-aside program, be exempted from this section altogether and that job search assistance be a service
strategy for this population without justification in the ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered these comments carefully and has decided that, like all title II&hyph;A participants,
older worker participants require assessment and need a justification in the ISS for stand-alone job search activities.
However, a new &sect;628.535(e) is added in the final regulations to recognize the preference of older individuals
for immediate job placement and to provide some flexibility in recognition of the special characteristics of older
workers. The Department's view is that this provision should not establish a routine practice to avoid the provision
of needed training services. The intent of the JTPA program remains to provide needed services to the hard to serve,
including older workers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters noted an ambiguity in the interim final regulations, that &sect;628.804(d) and (e) limit the provision
of preemployment and work maturity skills training and work experience, in addition to job search assistance, unless
they are accompanied by additional services; while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.535(b)(2) states, as an example, that work experience can be combined with job search training. Accordingly,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.535(b)(2) is revised to specifically exclude this example as well as other services which may not be used
to meet the combination requirement. Additional services which may be provided in conjunction with job search may
include the training services specified in JTPA section 204(b)(1), except stand-alone skill assessment, counseling,
work experience and case management, and the direct training services listed in 264(b) of the Act excluding tutoring,
stand-alone skill assessment, counseling, work experience and case management. Commenters also pointed out that
the title II&hyph;C program does not contain an ``exceptions'' provision to this requirement as section 204(c)(2)(B)(ii)
of the Act does for the title II&hyph;A program. To address this inconsistency, &sect;628.535(c) is amended to state
that the exceptions are not applicable to title II&hyph;C. On the other hand, it is important to note that, for the purposes
of this section, because title II&hyph;C in-school youth are enrolled in educational programs, they meet the requirement
of being enrolled in ``other additional services'' (&sect;628.804(d) and (e)).

Several commenters felt that the requirements at &sect;628.540 were too restrictive and burdensome. In response,
and in consideration of the principle that a volunteer program should, in fact, be voluntary for former participants,
the Department is removing the goals, objectives and documentation requirements in the final rule. Section 628.540,
as revised, merely repeats the statutory requirement which the Department believes is self-explanatory. The Department
encourages the SDA's to work with former participants to have them share their experiences in the program and in the
workplace with current participants. The Department also advises the SDA's to document any use of JTPA funds for this
volunteer program.

Sections 205 and 265 of the Act require that SDA's operating adult and year-round youth programs establish appropriate
linkages with other Federal human resource programs, including Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) JOBS
program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Comprehensive Modernization Program, the Department
of Energy's (DOE) Low Income Weatherization Grant program and programs under the National Service Act. Other linkages
may also be established with appropriate State and local educational, social service, and public housing agencies,
including CBO's, business and labor organizations, volunteer groups and others, such as women and older worker organizations,
to avoid duplication and to enhance the delivery of services. In addition, youth programs are required to establish
linkages with appropriate educational agencies which include formal agreements for procedures for referring and
serving in-school youth, methods of assessment, notification when students drop out of school, and arrangements
with educational agencies for services for in-school and out-of-school youth. These provisions are reflected in
&sect;628.545. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters urged that coordination should begin at the Federal level. The Department agrees and has begun
discussions with a number of other Federal agencies to increase coordination at the Federal level and, as the commenters
requested, to seek ways to develop common definitions and procedures applicable across program lines. The commenters
were concerned that all the responsibility for coordination rests on the JTPA system. It is, of course, true that the
Act and these regulations, since they focus on the JTPA system place a burden on the system to be a prime mover in the process
of developing coordinated program relationships. A State or SDA is required to make good faith efforts to seek coordination
and cooperation where it is possible to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned the ability of SDA's to establish appropriate linkages if other agencies are not operating
under similar mandates. Some comments recommended that the Governor encourage coordination efforts through the
SJTCC and, where feasible, develop agreements at the State level which would provide the basis and authority for local
agreements and ensure the best utilization of funds between agencies. The Department agrees that these recommendations
are a good way to establish effective and systematic coordination and language to this effect is added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.545(a). The new language recognizes both the SJTCC and the HRIC, whichever is in place in a State, as useful
focus points for coordination efforts. In addition, a few comments referred to the importance of the SDA's documenting
instances of attempted coordination efforts and of sharing this information with the Governor's office. This provision
also is included in &sect;628.545(a) to link State coordination agreements with local achievements by means of the
job training plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to emphasize the importance of ``one-stop shop'' career centers and seamless ``single point of contact''
delivery systems, which was the concern of several commenters, a new &sect;628.545(b) is added. SDA's are encouraged
to facilitate such delivery systems in coordination with other agencies, which may include both the development
of ISS plans and of a common program application, as well as a unified job development effort and comprehensive program
design. Such linkages may provide for a JTPA entity jointly funding or administering a program with funds from another
agency, such as an SDA jointly funding aspects of a public housing agency's Comprehensive Modernization Program
or the local JOBS program. Alternatively, when appropriate, the SDA could earmark funds to be spent within public
housing areas for services to residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other coordination issues discussed were the difficulty of defining and receiving information on dropouts from
some local educational agencies and the fact that agreements should be limited to those education agencies which
plan in-school activities. With regard to obtaining information on school dropouts, the Department has initiated
discussions with the Department of Education with the goal of working out a common definition and systematic approach
for identifying and serving dropouts. In the meantime, States are encouraged to negotiate agreements with State
educational agencies to facilitate this task. With regard to limiting the agreements required at the local level
with educational agencies, &sect;628.545(c) is amended to reflect these concerns by the addition of the qualifying
terms ``appropriate'' and ``which participate in JTPA programs.''

Transfer of Funds

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters raised questions concerning timing issues not addressed in &sect;628.550 of the interim final rule:
whether transfers must occur at the beginning of the program year; whether they may occur at any time during the 3-year
funding period; and whether the provisions are applicable to the 1993 title II&hyph;B program. The Department does
not address these issues in the final rule, leaving the first two issues to be addressed at the Governor's discretion.
In response to the third issue, the provisions are applicable to the 1993 title II&hyph;B program; this issue is addressed
in the transition provisions at &sect;627.904(k)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, paragraph (b) is revised to permit transfers of up to 20% of the title II B funds allocated to an SDA under
section 252(b) of the Act to title II C. This change is consistent with the amendment made to section 256 of the Act by
the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;227.

Title II&hyph;A_The Adult Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the general requirements of title II&hyph;A appear in subpart E of part 628 of the interim final rule. There
are a few specific requirements of title II&hyph;A which appear in part 628, subpart F. These include sections on eligibility;
requirements to assist hard-to-serve individuals; types of training services, counseling and supportive services;
and linkages and coordination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who were confused about whether the provisions of the formula for allocation of funds set
a maximum age of participation at 72 years, &sect;628.605(a) is amended to clarify that there is no maximum age of participation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked for clarification on the determination of the 65-percent threshold of serving the hard-to-serve.
Section 628.605(c)(1) is amended to clarify that all participants, including the non-disadvantaged (10 percent
window), are considered in determining the 65 percent who are hard-to-serve. Section 628.605(c)(2) now addresses
the question of when, in the service continuum, an individual is counted for determining compliance with the 65-percent
barrier requirement by clarifying, as discussed earlier, that it is calculated upon participants who have received
a service subsequent to objective assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned the inconsistency in the provisions regarding the ten-percent window in section
204(d) of the Act and the provisions for eligibility in the basic title II&hyph;A program, set forth in &sect;628.605(e),
when an older worker is in a joint program between JTPA and title V of the Older Americans Act. As discussed in connection
with the provisions of &sect;628.320, this inconsistency has been addressed by the Congress in amendments to the
Older Americans Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, on the regulatory provisions of &sect;628.605(c) and &sect;628.803(d) addressing the 65-percent requirement,
several commenters asked what would be the ramifications of non-compliance. Of course, the Department does not expect
difficulty in meeting these requirements. Since the Act imposes these percentage service requirements, as well
as the requirement on the in-school, out-of-school 50/50-percent ratio, on participants and not to funds, the Department
believes that they would be the subject of administrative corrective action by the SDA and, subsequent action by the
Governor under the provisions of section 164(b)(1) of the Act and part 628, subpart G of the final rule, as appropriate.

Summer Youth Employment and Training Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart G of part 628 covers the Summer Youth Employment and Training Program (SYETP under title II&hyph;B, effective
with calendar year 1994. It reflects the policy of closer integration for youth between academic fundamentals (such
as reading and mathematics) and work requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters raised issues related to the SYETP authorized under title II&hyph;B. Several commenters requested
broad flexibility in the scope of the objective assessment and ISS required for summer program participants. Some
expressed the fear that these requirements will result in a reduction of the number of SYETP participants due to the
increased burden on current staff. The Department recognizes that the achievement objectives and resulting service
strategies for summer youth differ from what might be expected in the adult program and that the corresponding assessment
processes would vary accordingly. Section 253(c)(1)(A) of the Act states that SYETP programs shall include objective
assessment of the basic skills and the supportive service needs of each participant. The SDA may use school records
on math and reading levels to determine basic skills. Similarly, the fully developed ISS, described in subpart E,
is not required for a participant who is enrolled only in the SYETP, as is reflected in &sect;628.515(b)(2). For those
participants transferring to the year-round program under title II&hyph;C, the full objective assessment and ISS
would be required. The results of any post-title II&hyph;B participation test should be used as part of the assessment
process when transferring the individual to a program under title II&hyph;C. Within the limits imposed by any applicable
state or local privacy laws or rules, SDA's are encouraged to make as much use as possible of existing information from
schools and from title II&hyph;B participation in developing the full objective assessment for a transferring participant,
as well as sharing available JTPA information with school counselors and other appropriate school officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters addressed the inability of SDA's to provide the required basic and remedial education services without
reducing the number of youth served or other services to youth. While this is a difficult tradeoff in some areas, the
Department is bound by the emphasis in the amendments to provide educational services to participants. In some instances,
it may be necessary to reduce the number of participants served in order to get high-quality experiences under title
II&hyph;B. Coordination and leveraging of resources is recommended to allow more participants to receive educational
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to more closely conform to sections 251 and 253(a) of the Act, &sect;628.701(a), on Program Goals and Objectives,
is amended. The ``enhancement of basic educational skills'' is added to the list of possible SDA goals and objectives.
Other additions include ``encouragement of school completion or enrollment in supplementary or alternative school
programs'' and ``improvement of employability skills including provision of vocational exploration opportunities
and exposure to the world of work, and enhancement of youth citizenship skills.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters spoke of various difficulties involved with the determination and documentation of eligibility
under the National School Lunch Act. Guidance on eligibility verification pertaining to the determination and documentation
of eligibility under the National School Lunch Act will be developed in consultation with the Department of Agriculture
and will be provided outside of these regulations. See the further discussion of this subject in the section pertaining
to programs under title II&hyph;C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed previously, in connection with eligibility for the education coordination grant program,
the Department has determined that the criteria for eligibility, as they relate to the ``economically disadvantaged''
eligibility criterion and alternatives for in-school youth, should be consistently applied across programs under
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act. Therefore, in addition to eligibility for free lunch under the National School
Lunch Act, the Department adds participation in a compensatory education program under title I chapter I of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act and in a schoolwide program, as specified at section 263(g) of the Act, to the criteria
at &sect;628.702 of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who raised the issue of the perceived limitation of 500 hours on the duration of work experience
for youth and its effect on the summer program, the Department refers to the discussion of work experience that appears
in connection with &sect;627.245 and the fact that the limitations on duration of work experience are removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.705(d), dealing with concurrent enrollment, is amended to clarify that 65 percent of the total number
of title II&hyph;C participants shall have one or more barriers to employment. This is necessary because no such additional
barrier to employment requirement exists in title II&hyph;B. The SDA must decide who is enrolled in title II&hyph;C
programs from title II&hyph;B or elsewhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (e) on follow-up services is added to &sect;628.705. Section 253(d) of the Act requires that followup
services be provided for participants if the ISS indicates that such services are appropriate. Title II&hyph;B funds
may be used such follow-up services up to one year after program participation, including when this coincides with
title II&hyph;C participation when determined appropriate during participation in the title II&hyph;B program
and recorded in the participant record. All supportive services in section 4(24), except financial assistance,
are included in followup services. Appropriate followup activities for title II&hyph;B participants include counseling,
mentoring, or tutoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with the enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, there were amendments to the program under Title
II&hyph;B. The Department believes that these are important changes and wishes to call attention to them in this rulemaking
process. Therefore, some of the statutory provisions have been directly included in this final rule at &sect;628.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters suggested that the term ``out-of-school youth'' be clarified or defined in &sect;628.803(h).
Several commenters specifically cited attendance in an alternative school or education program as a criterion.
A few commenters specifically said that the Congressional Conference Committee Report makes clear that this definition
encompasses youth enrolled in alternative education programs. They encouraged the inclusion of alternative education
programs in the definition of ``out-of-school youth''. Other comments stressed a combination of options including
students attending area learning centers, adult basic education classes, general educational development (GED)
preparation, vocational schools, or colleges. Others wanted truants, dropouts, and those on suspension status
specifically included. One recommended that the State define out-of-school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wanted the term ``in-school youth'' clarified or defined. Some commenters had specific suggestions
such as leaving the definition up to the Governor or placing it in &sect;625.5, Definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an earlier attempt to provide administrative clarification in this area, the Department had provided guidance
to the Regional Offices on the definition of ``in-school youth'' and out-of-school youth'' in Field Memorandum No.
34&hyph;93. This guidance indicated that an in-school youth was a youth who had not received a high school degree and
was attending school on a full-time compulsory basis. An out-of-school youth was a youth who was not in school, or as
suggested by the report of the Conferees, was attending alternative school or was habitually truant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comments to the Department, it was indicated that the interim guidance was problematic for two reasons. First,
a 14 or 15-year-old youth attending alternative school would not be eligible to participate if defined as out-of-school
since a 14 or 15-year-old could only be eligible as in-school youth. Second, if a youth was in alternative school and
considered in-school by the school system, but defined as out-of-school for JTPA, the eligibility criteria of participation
in a compensatory education program or eligibility for free lunch could not be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue is of some interest to the JTPA system, especially in light of the requirement that at least 50 percent of the
youth served be out-of-school youth. The Department has given careful consideration to this matter and has determined
to take a slightly different course. The regulations define ``in-school youth'' at &sect;628.803(b). The Department
has not included the concept of being subject to compulsory attendance requirements because in some States these
requirements end at an age before a youth has attained a diploma and the Department believes that attainment of a diploma
is key to the criteria for being in school. The word ``diploma'' is substituted for ``degree'' to distinguish from
post-secondary attainment. Any other youth is out-of-school. Rather than further define ``out-of-school'' in
a way that would create the problems noted above or create a number of unnecessary exceptions, the Department has decided
to adopt, in &sect;628.803(h), the exceptions suggested in the Conference Report which set forth the requirement
that 50-percent of youth served must be out-of-school. The Conference Report indicates that youth in alternative
schools or who are ``habitually truant'' may be considered as out-of-school for purposes of meeting the statutory
requirement. ``Alternative school'' also is defined. Section 628.803(h) is revised accordingly so that paragraph
(h)(2) is redesignated as paragraph (h)(3) and a new paragraph (h)(2) is added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned that the status of high school graduates was unclear. The intent of the revision
of the definitions in the final rule is to make it clear that all youth who are not in-school are out-of-school. Thus,
high school graduates or GED recipients, who are not enrolled in post-secondary education programs, would qualify
as out-of-school youth. It should be stressed, however, that the primary intent of including the ``out-of-school''
eligibility category in title II&hyph;C was to stress services to high school dropouts. SDA's should focus their
services on this group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted the problems with documenting the free lunch program as an eligibility criterion for youth.
That program has strict confidentiality provisions. One urged the Department to work with the appropriate agency
to improve the existing process. While section 9 of the National School Lunch Act assures confidentiality, schools
may release summary information such as the number of eligible children in a school. Parents may sign waivers of confidentiality
for specific programs. Households may voluntarily provide evidence of eligibility. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) is requesting that their regional offices notify State agencies of these regulations and suggest they share
this information with local school administrators. The Department plans to work with USDA staff to coordinate this
effort. Section 628.803(c) is amended to reflect that the Department will provide further guidance on the verification
of documentation regarding the free lunch program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the requirement to serve hard-to-serve individuals, &sect;628.803(d)(2) is amended to state that all
Job Corps participants shall be considered as out-of-school and shall be automatically considered to have a barrier
to employment. This change is made to foster JTPA/Job Corps coordination. SDA's now will have an incentive to provide
job development and placement services for Job Corps participants. All positive program terminations will be enjoyed
by both systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter sought clarification as to whether non-economically disadvantaged youth enrolled as a part of a schoolwide
project are to be counted as part of the 10 percent non-economically disadvantaged stated in &sect;628.803(f). As
stated in &sect;628.803(h)(2), these youth do not count against the 10-percent window. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters sought clarification of the provisions of the regulations regarding title II&hyph;C eligibility based
on schoolwide project participation. Section 628.803 is amended to add a paragraph (g)(3) to restate the provisions
of the Act on the criteria for schools that qualify for schoolwide projects, and a paragraph (g)(4) which states that
the SDA determines its schoolwide projects and provides a list of examples of possible projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter pointed out that section 263(g)(1)(C) of the Act requires that projects be in schools in which not less
than 70 per cent are hard-to-serve and that the regulations should define a reasonable standard to determine this.
This is addressed in DOL's Technical Assistance Guide on Eligibility which specifies that the school makes the certification
that 70 percent of its students meet the criteria. The SDA may rely upon the school's certification for purposes of
compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters suggested that for a school-wide project, an entire school district should be allowed to qualify
and not just an individual school. The Department believes that the provisions of the Act clearly apply to an individual
school. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters sought clarification of when SDAs would be required to have complied with the requirement to serve
50-percent youth who are out-of-school. Section 628.803(h)(1) is amended to state that the Governor has the responsibility
to determine the period for which the 50 percent out-of-school requirement will be calculated based either on the
period covered by the job training plan or on a program year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters maintained that the term ``dropout'' needed clarification. ``School dropout'' is defined at section
4(38) of the Act as an individual who is no longer attending any school and who has not received a secondary school diploma
or a certificate from a program of equivalency for such a diploma. That definition is now referenced at &sect;628.804(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were many comments on title II&hyph;C authorized services including limited internships, entry employment
experiences, cooperative education, tryout employment, youth work experience, youth OJT, and others. Most of these
comments indicated confusion and asked for clarification in a variety of ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wanted limited internships clarified. A few commenters expressed surprise at how open limited internships
were compared to OJT with 100-percent wage reimbursement at a private-for-profit employer and no classroom training
component. A few commenters thought the provision on entry employment experience was poorly written and confusing.
Some wanted clarification on cooperative education. Entry employment experience, cooperative education, and
limited internship offer work-based training experiences in a work setting. The Department believes that the particulars
of how they are designed and carried out should be a matter of State and local policy, so long as they are consistent with
general provisions of the regulations. The Department encourages the development of such work-based training programs
in conjunction with education components that reinforce the experience. The 500-hour limitation on entry employment
experience and limited internship is removed and &sect;628.804(h)(2) of the final rule is amended accordingly.
With regard to cooperative education programs, the Department wishes to emphasize that, as has been the practice,
no subsidized wages may be paid to participants in this activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who sought clarification of what constituted an alternative course of study, the &sect;628.803(h)(2)
includes examples of an alternative school program including an alternative course of study in connection with the
in-school, out-of-school ratio. Section 628.804(b) indicates that the alternative course of study shall be approved
by the local educational authority and may be delivered by a CBO. The Department believes that the JTPA rules should
not specify the characteristics of an alternative course of study when, in almost all instances, this falls within
the responsibility of the local educational authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked whether tryout employment is allowable under title II&hyph;C. Tryout employment previously was
described in section 205 of the Act. If conducted under the provisions of title II&hyph;C, it would be a kind of entry
employment experience. The design of such an activity and the decision to use it is made at the local level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters stressed that youth work experience should not be limited to 500 hours. As previously discussed,
the final rule is revised to clarify that work experience has no duration limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed alarm over the title II&hyph;C OJT requirement that the youth OJT wage equal or exceed
the average wage at placement of title II&hyph;A wage. Commenters stated, in various ways, that the new provisions
on OJT for youth will eliminate youth OJT as a program option and that JTPA will lose its ability to serve this special
needs population. There were several recommendations on how to compute wage. Several wanted the wage to be computed
based totally on youth wages. It is clear that the language at section 264(d)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act intends the youth
OJT wage to be based on the adult wage in title II&hyph;A. Section 628.804(j)(1)(i) is amended to clarify that wages
for OJT positions meet or exceed the average wage at placement in the SDA for participants under title II&hyph;A ``based
on the most recent available data.'' This replaces the language in the interim final rule of ``in the preceding program
year.'' Some may still view these provisions as eliminating private sector work for youth. The Act, however, provides
other opportunities for youth in the private sector, such as entry employment experience, limited internships,
and cooperative education. A few commenters expressed concern that disabled youth will be hurt by the new wage restrictions
for youth OJT. These new training options may be developed with the disabled in mind. These options can be used to provide
sheltered or supported work experiences for disabled youth similar to those available under OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.804(k) is amended to clarify that supportive services may be provided after termination. They include
the full range of supportive services defined at section 4(24) of the Act, except for financial assistance, for up
to a year after termination. In the title II&hyph;B section of this Preamble, ``follow-up services'' that would help
bring JTPA closer to the goal of a year round program for youth are discussed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments received by the Department in response to the December 29, 1992, interim final rule specifically
addressed title III issues and concerns. The revisions to the regulations for part 631, Programs under Title III of
the Job Training Partnership Act, were driven by changes to the legislative provisions contained in the Job Training
Amendments of 1992 and the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. Only those comments pertaining to the proposed
regulatory revisions stemming from the legislative changes were considered. After the issuance of the interim final
rule, the enactment of the NAFTA Worker Security Act required additional revisions to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended editorial changes to the proposed regulatory language. These suggestions were
incorporated depending on their accuracy and usefulness. Major comments on the proposed revisions to Part 631, the
Department's analysis of and reaction to those comments, and major changes to the final rule are discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule at &sect;631.2 added an additional definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response
assistance)'', which establishes a minimum threshold for the provision of rapid response assistance. This minimum
threshold cannot be waived, but a new provision, at &sect;631.30(b)(6), which provides the Governor with alternatives
for complying with the threshold and providing rapid response assistance in exceptional circumstances has been
clarified. In addition, that provision has been expanded to reflect a requirement of the NAFTA Worker Security Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether the ``employment loss'' in this new definition relates to a single business or
to the geographic area. To maintain consistency with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act,
``employment loss'' in this context relates to a single site of employment . 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the new definition of ``substantial layoff'', another commenter stated that employers periodically
lay off, temporarily, 50 or more employees during a 30-day period and then recall these individuals. Therefore, the
commenter recommends that rapid response assistance should only be authorized if the duration of a layoff is expected
to last for 6 months or more. The Department believes that, after determining a layoff meets the definition of substantial
layoff for rapid response assistance purposes, a State is still required to determine, among other things, the expected
duration of the layoff, the level of need of the affected individuals and their individual eligibility for services.
Ascertaining their need for assistance should include contacting the employer and a representative of the workers.
The State should then decide whether or not to offer services based on these determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters believed the new definition would exclude rapid response assistance for numerous small scale reductions
and stated that, if the definition could not be altered, more latitude should be given to the States under the ``exceptional
circumstances'' provision to respond to smaller layoffs. A commenter suggested expanding ``exceptional circumstances''
to include other situations, and another commenter suggested alternative language for &sect;631.30(b)(6) to allow
the Governor to establish a threshold below 50 for rapid response assistance purposes. Finally, one commenter thought
&sect;631.30(b)(6) directly contradicted the definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response assistance)''
and questioned the legislative basis for this new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a statutory provision, the minimum threshold of 50 employees established by the new definition of substantial
layoff cannot be waived. However, through &sect;631.30(b)(6), the regulations do provide flexibility to States
to establish policies that allow rapid response assistance to be provided to layoffs of less than 50 workers at a single
site. The Governor must establish guidelines defining parameters for ``impact on a local community.'' The only limitation
is that States must maintain a capability to respond to single site layoffs of 50 workers or more. In other words, States
cannot establish policies which would exhaust their ability to provide effective and timely rapid response to layoffs
of at least 50 workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few comments reflected concerns with both definitions of substantial layoff or with having two separate definitions.
One commenter believed the Governor should have the discretion to reduce the worker threshold below 50, while another
believed the definitions must be flexible enough to accommodate local circumstances. A few commenters stated that
having two different definitions was administratively confusing and could lead to disallowed costs as a result of
the difficulty of ascertaining if the 33 percent threshold had been met. To promote consistency, they recommended
using the definition of ``substantial layoff for rapid response purposes'' as the sole definition of the term. Other
commenters believed having two distinct definitions established a possible conflict (i.e., individuals who receive
services through rapid response assistance may not meet the title III eligibility criteria), and indicated that
a single definition of rapid response was preferable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of ``substantial layoff for participant eligibility'' and of ``substantial layoff for rapid response
purposes'' are different as a result of responsive title III policy evolution. Originally, the Department used the
WARN definition of ``mass layoff'' to establish a linkage between title III programs and WARN, and to set forth a minimum
threshold for the provision of State rapid response services. To provide greater flexibility for State rapid response
assistance, Congress provided an additional definition of substantial layoff, but clearly made it exclusively
for rapid response purposes. Therefore, the two definitions of substantial layoff will remain intact.

&sect;631.3(b) for the receipt of selected readjustment and retraining services in instances where an employer
makes a public announcement of a plant closure, pursuant to section 314(h) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked what constitutes a public announcement of a planned closure. One commenter specifically asked
what constitutes a public announcement for the State, and if a WARN notice or a letter to the Governor or locally elected
official from the employer would suffice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.3(b)(4) states that ``the Governor shall establish criteria defining `public announcement'. Such
criteria shall include provisions that the public announcement shall be made by the employer and shall indicate a
planned closure date for the facility (section 314(h) of the Act).'' The Department believes a WARN notice, and most
likely a less formal declaration by an employer, would meet these criteria. However, within the parameters established
in the regulations, the Governor ultimately determines what constitutes a public announcement of a planned closure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned what would happen if a decision to close a plant was changed. A few commenters specifically
asked what would occur if a decision was reversed (e.g., Would the project be canceled? What happens to the workers
who were determined eligible and enrolled? Are they terminated? What impact would a reversal have on cost category
limitation, performance standards and outcomes?). They recommended the institution of a hold harmless provision.
One commenter asked if an individual would remain eligible for retraining should a closure date be delayed or if an
individual in classroom training never received a notice of layoff. Finally, another commenter stated that the participants
should not be denied service or experience an interruption in enrollment due to delays in closing dates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination of EDWAA eligibility for any of the program's services and activities is determined based on the
best information available at the time. If the circumstances upon which the eligibility decision(s) were based change,
a reevaluation of the continued need for the services/activities is appropriate. It is expected that consideration
would be given to such factors as the exact nature of the employer action (postponement or reversal), where the participant
is in the system (e.g., whether the participant is enrolled and participating in a retraining activity), and the impact
of a termination on the individual. However, title III expenditures for services/activities to a participant who
was correctly determined to be eligible are not, in and of themselves, disallowed costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked how States should define ``plant or facility closing'' within the context of &sect;631.3(b). Specifically,
they asked if WARN rules should be used in defining these terms (i.e., whether line closings within a plant or the elimination
of a shift should be considered a plant closing). While the Department believes the WARN rules provide helpful guidance,
this determination is left to the discretion of the Governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requested the addition of language requiring the availability of ``rapid response-like activities''
to a firm entering bankruptcy, whether or not a formal public announcement has been made. Section 631.3(b)(1) provides
for participant eligibility in the event of a formal public announcement of a plant closure. While no change is made
in the final rule, a State may, pursuant to section 314(b) of the Act, provide rapid response assistance after becoming
aware of a current or projected permanent closure or substantial layoff. Moreover, the firm's employees may receive
the services authorized in section 314 of the Act if they meet the eligibility criteria established at section 301.
In assessing the circumstances of an impending bankruptcy, it is expected that the Governor would determine whether
the filing would result in a closing, a layoff, or a Chapter 11 restructuring with no contemplated change in manpower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter questioned whether or not a participant had to be enrolled to receive basic readjustment services and
if limited basic readjustment services could be provided to eligible workers prior to enrollment into a title III
program. Section 314(c) of the Act (Basic Readjustment Services), of course, includes outreach and intake. The Department
believes that outreach and intake services include limited assessment of an eligible applicant to allow service
providers to evaluate an applicant's suitability for JTPA training and services. The definition of ``participant''
at section 4 of the Act provides that: ``Participation shall be deemed to commence on the first day, following determination
of eligibility, on which the participant began receiving subsidized employment, training or other services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters felt that &sect;631.3(b)(3) inappropriately excluded certain groups from consideration as ``eligible
dislocated workers'' pursuant to &sect;631.3(b). A few believed involuntary, forced and early retirements should
be excepted from this provision, since many individuals falling into this category have lost jobs through no fault
of their own. Stating that individuals are often forced or ``seduced'' into early retirement, another commenter
wished to except any individual who is likely to retire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion of individuals ``likely to retire instead of seeking new employment'' is statutorily required at section
314(h)(1) of the Act and, therefore, will remain. The Department interprets the Act to preclude services to those
who are unlikely to need them because they will remain employed with the employer or because they will retire. The decision
about whether any individual who has ``voluntarily'' retired does, in fact, intend to remain unemployed must be made
on a case-by-case basis. This decision is best made at the state or local level. Therefore, the Governor is responsible
for the interpretation of this phrase and its subsequent application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter questioned what was acceptable documentation that a person is ``likely to remain employed with
the employer or to retire'' when no individual notice is provided. It is within the Governor's discretion to determine
what would be acceptable documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;631.3(j) is added to set forth the requirements of section 250(b)(2)(C) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.
2271, et seq.), as amended by the NAFTA Worker Security Act (Title V of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 314(f)(2) of the Act states that eligible individuals participating in title III programs may receive unemployment
compensation benefits consistent with State policies under the Approved Training Rule and defines eligible workers
as those ``participating in training (except on-the-job training).'' The language in the final rule at &sect;631.4
is revised from participation in ``any of the programs'' to ``any retraining activity, except on-the-job training.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter thought that limiting the receipt of unemployment compensation benefits to only those trainees participating
in a retraining activity was inappropriate. Specifically, the commenter believed trainees in a class providing
assessment and the preparation of an individual service strategy (ISS) are not available and looking for work, and
they too need compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objective assessment and preparation of an individual readjustment plan are defined in section 314(c) of the Act
as basic readjustment services and, therefore, individuals participating solely in these activities fail to meet
the criteria established under section 314(f)(2) of the Act and &sect;631.4.

Section 631.13 was not altered in the interim final regulations. However, a few commenters suggested redefining
``retraining'' to be consistent with ``direct training services'' under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and ``basic
readjustment services'' to be consistent with ``training-related services'' under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department acknowledges that statutory requirements often present barriers to coordination, it must
be pointed out that titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and title III authorize separate programs with distinct goals,
structures, services and requirements. For example, objective assessment is defined in titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C
as a direct training service while it is defined in title III as a basic readjustment service. The statute and, in turn,
the regulations reflect this fact. Therefore, the different terms with their distinct definitions remain intact
in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis for computing the cost limitations which apply to expenditures of title III funds has been changed from annual
expenditures to program year allocation (for substate grantees), or to funds reserved by the Governor from the program
year allotment (for States). This change reflects the amendments to section 315 and recognizes that grantees are
permitted to have up to 3 years in which to spend allotted funds, subject to certain adjustments applied through the
reallotment process for under-expenditure. Other major changes to this subject area include the addition of &sect;631.14(i)
to clarify that the funds allocated (or distributed) to a substate grantee under the provisions of section 302(c)(1)(E)
of the Act shall be included in the substate areas formula allocation for purposes of applying the cost limits, and
the addition of &sect;631.14(h) to allow neighboring substate grantees to combine funds to serve dislocated workers
from two or more substate areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked if it is allowable to provide funds to substate grantees under the provisions of section 302(c)(1)(A)&hyph;(D)
of the Act and, if so, whether these funds must be considered funds allocated to a substate grantee for the program year
of the funds' initial allotment to the State and included in the cost limitations of &sect;631.14(a)&hyph;(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While funds reserved by a State for activities under section 302(c)(1)(A)&hyph;(D) of the Act may be expended through
a subgrant or contract with a substate grantee, these funds would still be considered funds allocated to the Governor,
as defined at &sect;631.14(i)(3), for the program year of the funds' initial allotment to the State and included in
the cost limitations applicable to the Governor. As the statute allocates these funds to the Governor for the explicit
purpose of carrying out responsibilities assigned to the State, expenditures of these funds are to be treated as State-level
expenditures, regardless of the operator incurring those expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked whether TEGL No. 1&hyph;90, Change 1, which specified that cost limitations would be calculated
based on ``total maximum allowable expenditures'', would remain in effect after July 1, 1993 and if new guidelines
would be issued for calculating/determining title III cost limitation compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TEGL 1&hyph;90, Change 1 was issued on June 18, 1991, and its content was based on the statutory and regulatory provisions
effective at that time. The Department will review this TEGL and issue appropriate guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter also asked if the minimum/maximum percentage requirements would be applied to the total final
expenditures for each cost category to determine the minimum/maximum amounts after July 1, 1993. In a separate issuance,
the Department will issue reporting requirements which will clarify the application of the cost limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter discussed the inconsistency between the 15 percent cap on administrative costs under the title III
program and the 20 percent cap on administrative costs under the title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, section 108 of the Act established a revised limit of 20 percent of funds that may
be expended for administration. However, as noted above, while the basis for computing the cost limitations which
apply to expenditures of title III funds has changed, the statutory provision requiring a 15 percent cap on administrative
cost has not. Therefore, this difference between the programs shall remain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questioning the application of &sect;631.14(g), one commenter asked if cost limitations must be complied with immediately
if funds are deobligated and, therefore, are no longer available. Cost limitations are applied at the time funds are
no longer available for expenditure, in other words, when the 3-year availability period ends. When funds are deobligated,
the total pool of funds which is available for expenditure is reduced and becomes the new base on which cost limitations
will be applied. However, a State or substate grantee still has the entire period of fund availability to comply with
the cost limitations as they apply to this new base.

Federal Reporting Requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new provision was added in the interim final regulations, at &sect;631.15, requiring the State to provide a breakdown
of all administrative expenditures by the dislocated worker unit, pursuant to section 311(b)(11) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked what cost breakdowns and line items are required in the reports. As indicated in &sect;631.15,
the specifics regarding the reports' content and format will be addressed through instructions to be issued by the
Secretary. These were included in the reporting instructions for title III programs for PY 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new provision is added, at &sect;631.17, clarifying the Secretary's authority to oversee the State's provision
of rapid response assistance and to require corrective action as necessary, as provided for in section 314(b)(3)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned why the word ``may'' was used in &sect;631.17 in lieu of the word ``shall'' which is found
in the language of section 314(b)(3) of the Act. This section is revised to reflect the language of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prescribing how rapid response is to occur, another commenter thought this new provision, along with other sections
of the regulations, resulted in ``micro-management by the Department'' and reduced the flexibility available to
the States and local areas. The Amendments direct the Secretary to conduct oversight of rapid response to ensure the
``effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness'' of these actions. It remains the responsibility of the State to manage
its program in accordance with the Act and the regulations.

Needs-Related Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An amended provision in section 314(e)(1) regarding eligibility for needs-related payments requires that a participant
be unemployed, and this requirement is incorporated in &sect;631.20(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter disapproved of the change since it denies needs-related payments to participants working any number
of hours. This commenter indicated that not only were they able to keep the costs of these payments down by having participants
work part-time, but full-time students could work part-time and have these earnings supplemented by the payments
to allow them to complete their program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, section 314(e)(1) of the Act clearly states that a participant must be unemployed to receive needs-related
payments. As a result, the final rule remains unchanged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A provision at &sect;631.30(a)(8) requires the State to immediately (within 48 hours) notify the substate grantee
of current or projected layoffs and closures in the local area for the purpose of continuing and expanding upon the
services initiated by the rapid response team, as required in section 311(b)(3)(D) of the Act. Moreover, section
311(b)(12) of the Act stipulates that accountability for rapid response assistance resides in the dislocated worker
unit (DWU), although the DWU may contract with other entities for the provision of these services. This is reflected
in the provisions at &sect;631.30(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned whether 48 hours meant 48 working hours and what would happen if the information was made
available on a Friday afternoon. The Department believes the Governor is responsible for the interpretation and
application of the term ``48 hours.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter indicated stronger language needed to be incorporated into the regulations to ensure that the
State did not pass off its rapid response responsibilities to the substate grantees. After reviewing &sect;631.30(b),
the Department feels the language adequately addresses this concern. The regulatory provision remains unchanged.

Allocation of Funds by the Governor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Interim Final Regulations, a provision was added to &sect;631.32(b)(2) to clarify that Governors must give
consideration to each of the substate allocation formula factors required by section 302(d) of the Act unless the
factor is not relevant to economic dislocation conditions of the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters had questions regarding the formula for making substate allocations. One commenter indicated that
&sect;631.32(b)(3) should also allow a zero weight factor to be used where data are not adequate or not provided or
funded by a Federal partner. Specifically, they mentioned that plant closing and mass layoff data are no longer funded
and farmer-rancher economic hardship data have never been provided by the Department and the USDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mass Layoff Statistics program was temporarily suspended by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Department intends
to resume the Mass Layoff Statistics Program early in 1995. During the interim period, however, States will have to
develop their own data and proxies for mass layoffs. Similarly, States have been responsible for developing their
own data and proxies for farmer-rancher economic hardship data. It is inconceivable that a State government would
have no idea as to economic circumstances in its own State. If ``a review of the available data indicates that the factor
is not relevant to determining the incidence of need for worker dislocation assistance within the State'', then a
zero weight may be assigned (&sect;631.32(b)(3)). However, current lack of data is not an adequate reason for invalidating
a factor which is relevant to dislocation activity in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter wondered if the Governor had an obligation beyond the requirements of &sect;627.463 (public access
to records) to publicize the elements of the formula or describe the rationales for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department requires each State Plan to include a description of the State's substate allocation formula methodology,
including the data elements and allocation formula to be used. Moreover, pursuant to section 311(b)(9) of the Act,
the Plan must be made available to the State job training coordinating council to review and comment on prior to its
submittal to the Department. Therefore, through this process, both the State Council and the Department will have
an opportunity to examine the within-State distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While no significant revisions were made to &sect;631.50 of the regulations, one commenter stated that the interim
final rule omits any requirement for SSG's to meet program goals, develop an oversight plan and build capacity and
noted that comparable provisions for SDA's are at &sect;628.420(b)(2), (3) and (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, the proposed revisions to the regulations for part 631 were driven by changes to the legislative
provisions contained in the Job Training Amendments of 1992 and the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993.
The Department has chosen not to regulate in areas unaffected by statutory change. Only those comments pertaining
to the proposed regulatory revisions stemming from the legislative changes were considered for incorporation into
the final rule. Therefore, &sect;631.50 remains unchanged.

Cost Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 631.62 of the interim final rule stipulated that the cost limitations under part A of title III will apply to
projects operated under part B of title III, except when waived or altered by the application guidelines, or by the
Grant Officer in the terms of the grant. In response to comments, the Department has modified this provision in the
final rule. The Department still intends to use the title III&hyph;A cost limitations in cases where applicants for
grants do not ask for a different allocation of costs among the cost categories, but the Department does not wish to
discourage applicants from designing their programs in the manner that will best serve the affected population.
The final rule is revised to make it clear that applicants for grants can propose costs and that the Grant Officer has
the discretion to accept them. It is the Department's intent to provide grant applicants flexibility in designing
the mix of services in their programs. However, the Department will agree to proposals with administrative cost in
excess of 15% only in extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked if this provision will apply to the Defense Conversion Adjustment (DCA) Program projects currently
in operation or whether these projects will continue to operate under the regulations in effect at the time of award.
Each discretionary project is subject to the grant agreement and modifications as approved by the Grant Officer.
Modifications to an existing grant may be requested by the grantee and agreed to by the Grant Officer according to the
provisions of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, three commenters discussed the difficulty of applying the Act's section 315 cost limitations to Clean Air
Employment Transition Assistance projects. As stated above, the cost limitations in the grant agreement control,
however, modifications to existing grants may be requested. For future grants, applicants are free to apply for other
cost limits that fit their programs.

One commenter thought the process for notifying the Secretary regarding significant developments concerning the
grant or subgrant was too complicated and could delay the implementation of the project and workers' access to services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.63(b) simply requires the grantees to provide information to the Department on any significant developments
that impact the project. This reporting requirement should not affect or delay the project's execution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 631.60 has been clarified to state that Subpart G relates to programs and funds reserved to the Secretary for
use under part B of title III of the Act: Including section 323 (20% discretionary funds); section 324 (Demonstration
Programs); section 325 (Defense Conversion Adjustment Program); section 325A (Defense Diversification Program);
and section 326 (Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Defense Authorization Act for 1993 authorized the Defense Diversification Program (DDP) as an amendment
to JTPA, at section 325A. Its purpose is to provide retraining and readjustment assistance to workers and military
personnel dislocated by defense cutbacks and closures of military facilities; and to provide planning support and
conversion assistance for diversification of affected facilities within an area impacted by reductions in military
expenditures or closure of military facilities. Section 631.65(c) of this final rule prescribes the needs-related
payments procedure in accordance with the requirements in section 326(f) of the Act, as required by section 325A(i)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency; however, the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, at section 110(a), amended the Job Training Partnership Act by adding a new section 326,
establishing the Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance (CAETA) program. Section 326 is designed to assure
the establishment of programs to provide assistance to workers dislocated as a result of a firm's compliance with
the Clean Air Act. The purpose of these programs is to provide readjustment and retraining assistance to eligible
workers to enable such workers to return to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department published proposed CAETA regulations for comment on March 24, 1992 (57 FR 10232). Thirteen State,
substate entities and other organizations submitted comments. Upon review, the Department has determined that
there is no programmatic justification to have separate regulations for Clean Air. It is necessary, however, to make
specific provision in the JTPA regulations for specific statutory requirements applicable to the CAETA program.
The specific statutory requirements for that program are implemented herein at &sect;631.65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comments received pursuant to the proposed regulations requested clarification of general JTPA title
III areas that were subsequently addressed in the Interim Final Regulations on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 62004). The
following discussion relates to comments on issues specific to the Clean Air Act.

Agency. DOL agrees with this comment and has added this statement in the preamble.

Needs-Related Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received on the provisions of needs-related payments. One commenter indicated that the language
in the proposed regulations might discourage grant applicants from serving those eligible for payments so they can
conserve funds for training, and that applicants could perceive ETA as biased toward proposed grants with limited
needs-related payments (NRP's). It was also believed that grant applicants should be encouraged to seek eligible
dislocated workers most-in-need, particularly those requiring income support during training. The language at
&sect;631.65(c) of the final rule is intended to reflect the statutory requirement that CAETA programs provide for
adequate needs-related payments. The language is not intended to permit a programmatic restriction against those
dislocated workers who are eligible to receive NRP's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter raised a question about when grantees should start using family income to determine eligibility
for needs-related payments. The Department agrees that there should be a time frame; it is only upon actual enrollment
in a training and/or education program that one becomes eligible for consideration to receive needs-related payments.
Individual or family income for the six-month period immediately prior to a participant's enrollment in training
and education programs is to be annualized to determine eligibility for needs-related payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the determination of family income at the time of eligibility determination, and that the
three-month re-determination requirement in the proposed rule would create administrative burdens. The determination
of family income only applies to those dislocated workers who (1) have been determined eligible pursuant to section
326(a) of the Act, (2) have exhausted or are not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, and (3) have been
enrolled in training and education programs pursuant to section 326(f) of the Act. Section 326(f)(4) of the Act requires
adjustments reflecting changes in family income. The final rule is revised to require that eligibility determinations
``shall be reviewed periodically;'' however, it is expected that an equitable system would be outlined in a grant
application. It is expected that a grantee's system would be sensitive to participants' probable decreasing family
income (depending upon the date of layoff) under the six-month income determination rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested clarifying restrictions on needs-related payments to participants when relocation,
out-of-area job search, or TAA allowances have ceased, or when OJT has been completed. The statute requires that needs-related
payments be available to enable participants to complete training or education programs. Relocation and out-of-area
job search allowances would normally be provided to participants who possess marketable skills, and, therefore,
are not enrolled in training or education. If TAA allowances were being provided for training or education, needs-related
payments may be used when TAA allowances are exhausted (if a participant is otherwise eligible for and enrolled in
an education or training program under CAETA). After OJT, a participant ordinarily is employed and receives wages
from the employer. If the participant is not employed, NRP's could only be made if the participant is enrolled in other
training.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters asked what constitutes ``satisfactory progress'' in order for a participant to continue to receive
NRP's, and how often this determination must be made. The Department expects a grant application to define a system
to address this issue, based upon the training to be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter believed that the wording in the proposed rule, that grantees must provide needs-related payments, seemed
less definitive and suggested stating whether the projects will be funded without providing for payments to any participant.
Another commenter suggested having States check the needs-related payment policies of SDA's before initiating
the needs-related payments requirement. Two commenters suggested using the same eligibility criteria for needs-related
payments for CAETA as are used in other title III programs. Two commenters suggested allowing State or local flexibility
in determining who receives payments and payments policy. Another commenter suggested that it would be confusing
to make the needs-related payment rate applicable to the weekly unemployment compensation payment level or to the
poverty level, which the commenter believed would limit the number of eligible individuals in classroom training.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is unable to accede to the requests of these commenters. Needs-related payments are discretionary
under title III of JTPA, and grantees have some flexibility in providing such payments. However, under section 326(c)(2)
of the Act, CAETA funds must be used to provide needs-related payments in accordance with the requirements set forth
at section 326(f) of the Act. Similarly, section 325A(i) of the Act provides that in DDP programs, needs-related payments
must be made in accordance with section 326(f). The Act requires that the Secretary prescribe regulations with respect
to needs-related payments for CAETA and DDP. The needs-related payments regulations at &sect;631.65(c) follow
the statutory requirements at section 326(f) of the Act. Because of these statutory requirements of CAETA and DDP,
grantees have little discretion and must provide needs-related payments in the manner set forth in &sect;631.65(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested developing regulations that require grantees to document reasons for denial of payments
and give opportunities for participants who had payments suspended to seek redress up to and including the federal
level. The Department agrees that grantees should include descriptions of systems in grant applications which document
payments, reasons for denial of payments and suspensions. In addition, the regulations at &sect;631.64 require
each grantee to establish and to maintain a grievance procedure which, among other things, would handle grievances
related to needs-related payments. The regulations at subpart F of 20 CFR part 627 provide procedures for the federal
handling of allegations of violations of the Act or regulations.

Participant Eligibility

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine commenters raised questions regarding participant eligibility provisions for dislocated workers under CAETA.
One commenter suggested expanding the eligible population to workers needing skills upgrading or retraining on
new or modified equipment. Sections 301 and 326(a) of the Act establish eligibility criteria for CAETA. Dislocated
workers may receive skills training in the same occupation in which they were previously employed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 their current skills are obsolete, and such training is required for them to meet the local labor market hiring requirements
for that occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested including a statement regarding the eligibility of workers who had been laid off from mines
that supply coal to plants. The Department agrees that workers dislocated from mines as a result of compliance with
the Clean Air Act would be eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter raised the question of how one determines that an individual's dislocation is the consequence
of compliance with the Act if the layoff notice does not specifically mention the impact of the Clean Air Act, and whether
the grantee has to assure verification is done for each applicant. The CAETA grantee must determine and document that
a layoff is Clean Air Act-related and must verify that each applicant was a part of such layoff. The application guidelines
will provide for reasonable documentation which could establish that the layoff was related to the Clean Air Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested allowing temporary employment with the employer from which the worker was dislocated.
Participant eligibility for enrollment in CAETA is specified at section 326(a) of the Act. The Department believes
that temporary employment with the same employer is inconsistent with the definition of dislocation and is restricted

The Department received seven comments regarding entities eligible to apply for grants under CAETA. Three commenters
indicated that submitting applications directly to the Department of Labor, rather than through the State, could
lead to such problems as a lack of coordination, and duplication. Another commenter suggested that recipients should
provide assurances that they are administratively capable of operating the program. Two commenters suggested that
limiting eligible grantees to States and territories of the United States would ensure coordination with State entities
and SSGs. Section 326(b) of the Act permits the Secretary to recognize five types of eligible grantees, and it does
not require applicants to apply through the State. The Department recognizes that there would be benefits to submitting
all applications through the States, and encourages such action. It should be noted, however, that an ``eligible
grantee'' may not be an appropriate applicant for a particular project. The nature and extent of the proposed project,
and the capacity of an applicant, will be factors in evaluating an application and an applicant's ability to perform
the work.

Subpart I_Disaster Relief Employment Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new Subpart I, to be administered under the title III National Reserve Grants program, provides for Disaster Relief
Employment Assistance, as authorized by the new Amendments to title IV&hyph;J of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.84(a) discusses the projects that a unit of general local government in a disaster area may operate under
this subpart. One commenter suggested substituting the phrase, ``Davis-Bacon provisions shall apply on all projects
related to demolition, cleanup, repair *&blank;*&blank;*'' for ``on projects regarding demolition, cleanup,
repair *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Davis-Bacon does apply to Federal programs, the inclusion of this phrase does not change or clarify the meaning
of this provision. Therefore, the section will remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.85 outlines the participant eligibility criteria under the Disaster Relief Employment Assistance
Program. The statutory language regarding eligibility is not accurately reflected in this section. The final rule
is revised to correct this problem. In addition, one commenter thought the Department should have the authority to
declare persons who are eligible for titles II-A and II-C programs eligible for title III Disaster Relief Programs.
Since the statute does not grant the Department this blanket authority, expansion of participant eligibility criteria
will not occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.86 limits the length of disaster relief employment. One commenter questioned the difference between
this type of employment and public service employment which is prohibited under titles II and III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the statute prohibits public service employment funded under title II&hyph;A and C and title III&hyph;A,
public service employment is contemplated under title IV-J of the Act. Disaster relief employment is narrowly defined
and exclusively limited to the activities described under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;631.84. Allowable activities will not be expanded beyond the statutorily established parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter asked how costs incurred for disaster relief employment should be classified and what criteria
should be used in determining the monetary extent to which a cost category has benefited. The Department has chosen
not to issue detailed regulations for this program. Specific information regarding Disaster Relief Employment
Assistance projects, including any guidance on cost classification issues, will be contained in application guidelines
published by the Secretary. Until they are issued, an applicant for these funds should follow the guidelines and information
published in the July 9, 1992

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters addressed this section of the interim final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the comments addressed inconsistencies in the numbering of the sections and in the cross-references.
The part has been revised to correct the numbering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several of the commenters raised questions concerning how the program can be implemented in the absence
of any Congressional appropriation. While bonuses will not be awarded under title V of the Act until funds are appropriated
by Congress, individuals who are eligible to be counted for title V purposes may be served under other titles of the
Act. Since those individuals who would be eligible to be counted for the incentive bonuses under title V must also be
eligible for, and have participated in, other activities under the Act, the costs associated with their participation
in these activities would be charged to the appropriate program(s) and title(s) of the Act. If a State wishes to participate
in the title V bonus program, if it is ever funded, the State may wish to keep track of the outcomes of training for individuals
eligible to be counted for bonus purposes.

Effective Date

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that the regulations are being issued after the beginning of a program year. To avoid administrative
difficulties, the Department has made the effective date of the regulations June 30, 1995, the beginning of Program
Year 1995. This will give states and SDA's/SSG's time to plan for the changes that may result from the amendments made
in this final rule. States or SDA's/SSG's are, of course, free to implement any of the changes that they find will benefit
their programs earlier than the effective date and the Department will treat those changes as legally effective when
adopted in any subsequent monitoring or audit resolution activity. Consistent with the Department's desire to enable
states and SDAs to implement the beneficial changes in the final rule as quickly as they choose, the provisions of &sect;627.210,
authorizing the Department to grant waivers of regulatory requirements are made effective within 30 days of publication
to enable states to apply for waivers to be effective before the beginning of PY 1995.

It is the purpose of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA or the Act) to establish programs to prepare youth and adults
facing serious barriers to employment for participation in the labor force by providing job training and other services
that will result in increased employment and earnings, increased educational and occupational skills, and decreased
welfare dependency, thereby improving the quality of the work force and enhancing the productivity and competitiveness
of the Nation (section 2).

the educational institution's financial aid officer to inform the SDA's/SSG's of the amounts and disposition of
any HEA, title IV awards and other types of financial aid to each JTPA participant awarded after the enrollment of the
participant, as part of a continuing, regular information sharing process (section 141(b)).

General_(1) On-the-job training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (OJT) means training by an employer in the private or public sector given to a participant who, after objective assessment,
and in accordance with the ISS, has been referred to and hired by the employer following the development of an agreement
with the employer to provide occupational training in exchange for reimbursement of the employer's extraordinary
costs. On-the-job training occurs while the participant is engaged in productive work which provides knowledge
and skills essential to the full and adequate performance of the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) This does not preclude a participant who has been trained by one employer from ultimately being placed in a comparable
training-related position with another employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On-the-job training may be sequenced with or accompanied by other types of training such as classroom training
or literacy training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duration of OJT.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) OJT authorized for a participant shall be limited to a period not in excess of that required for the participant
to acquire the skills needed for the OJT position. Except as described in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, the period
of reimbursement to the employer under an OJT agreement shall not exceed 6 months of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 6-month duration of OJT may be expressed as a number of hours, days, or weeks the participant is expected to work
in a 6-month period if the participant works full-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the event that a participant's regular employment is less than full-time and less than 500 hours of OJT has occurred
by the end of 6 months, that participant may remain in OJT until 499 hours OJT hours have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) Recipients shall develop policies and procedures for determining the average training duration for occupations
including to reflect an individual participant's need for additional training time, or reduction in training time
to reflect the individual participant's partial acquisition of needed skills. (In no case should an individual who
is fully skilled in an occupation be placed in OJT in that occupation.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In determining the average training time, consideration should be given to recognized reference materials,
such as the ``Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (DOT) and employer training plans. Such materials need not be limited
to the DOT, however. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On-the-job training is encouraged, but not required, in all occupations with significant training content,
particularly in higher-skill occupations appropriate to the participant's needs. Training plans may be developed
that recognize the full duration of the OJT period necessary for the full and adequate performance of the job, but the
period of reimbursement may not exceed the duration in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When the OJT period in a given occupation for a participant for whom the ISS identifies OJT as appropriate varies
from the average for that occupation, the basis for the variation shall be recorded in the ISS.

On-the-job training payments to employers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) On-the-job training payments to employers are deemed to be in compensation for the extraordinary costs associated
with training participants and in compensation for the costs associated with the lower productivity of such participants.
Employers shall not be required to document such extraordinary costs or lower productivity (section 141(g)(1)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) On-the-job training payments to employers shall not, during the period of such training, average more than
50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to OJT participants.

(ii) On-the-job training payments to employers may be based upon scheduled raises or regular pay increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

wages paid by the employer to participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) On-the-job training payments may not be based upon periods of time such as illness, holidays, plant downtime
or other events in which no training occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Employers which provide classroom or vestibule training to meet the specific training needs of JTPA participants
to equip them with education and knowledge necessary to the OJT occupation may be separately reimbursed for training
costs, such as instructors and training material.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OJT participants shall be compensated by the employer at the same rates, including periodic increases, as similarly
situated employees, but in no event less than the higher of the minimum wage specified under the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938, as amended or the applicable State or local minimum wage. Participants must receive the same benefits
and have the same working conditions as similarly situated employees.

(1) Only those participants who have been assessed and for whom OJT has been determined as an appropriate activity
in the participant's ISS may be referred to an employer for participation in OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An individual referred to the JTPA program by an employer may be enrolled in an OJT program with such employer only
upon completion of the objective assessment and individual service strategy in which OJT with such employer has been
determined to be an appropriate activity and only if the employer has not already hired such individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) OJT with the participant's previous or current employer in the same, a similar, or an upgraded job is not permitted.

and that the training is being provided as specified in the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Brokering contractors shall conduct on-site monitoring of the OJT employers and other subcontractors to verify
compliance with subcontract terms before making payments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) OJT agreements shall not be entered into with employers which, under previous agreements, have exhibited a pattern
of failing to provide OJT participants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages, benefits
and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as similarly situated employees. This prohibition
does not apply to OJT agreements for youth in the program under title II&hyph;B who are returning to school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Governors shall issue procedures and criteria to implement the requirement in paragraph (h)(1) of this section,
which shall specify the duration of the period of loss of eligibility. The procedures and criteria shall provide that
situations in which OJT participants quit voluntarily, are terminated for cause, or are released due to unforeseeable
changes in business conditions will not necessarily result in termination of employer eligibility.

(a) In the development and conduct of programs funded under the Act, SDA's and SSG's shall ensure that participants
are not assigned to work for employers which do not comply with applicable labor laws, including wage and hour, occupational
health and safety, and child labor laws (29 CFR part 570). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To the extent that a State workers' compensation law is applicable, workers' compensation benefits in accordance
with such law shall be available with respect to injuries suffered by participants. Where a State's workers' compensation
law is not applicable, recipients and subrecipients shall secure insurance coverage for injuries suffered by such
participants in all JTPA work-related activities. Income maintenance coverage (e.g., contributions for unemployment
compensation), is not required for participants (section 143(a)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where a participant is engaged in activities not covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,
as amended, the participant shall not be required or permitted to work, be trained, or receive services in buildings
or surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the participant's
health or safety. A participant employed or trained for inherently dangerous occupations, e.g., fire or police jobs,
shall be assigned to work in accordance with reasonable safety practices (section 143(a)(2)).

Competition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each State and subrecipient shall conduct procurements in a manner which provides full and open competition.
Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms or organizations in order for them to qualify to do business; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Organizational conflicts of interest; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing ``an equal'' product to be offered and describing
the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Overly restrictive specifications; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each State and subrecipient shall have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures shall
ensure that all solicitations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service
to be procured (including quantities). Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features
which unduly restrict competition; and

or proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PIC conflict of interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) A PIC member shall not cast a vote, nor participate in any decisionmaking capacity, on the provision of services
by such member (or any organization which that member directly represents), nor on any matter which would provide
any direct financial benefit to that member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Neither membership on the PIC nor the receipt of JTPA funds to provide training and related services shall be construed,
by itself, to violate provisions of section 141(f) of the Act or &sect;627.420. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A conflict of interest under paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section would arise when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The individual, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any member of the individual's immediate family, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The individual's partner, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the
firm or organization selected for award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The officers, employees, or agents of the agency and PIC members making the award will neither solicit nor accept
gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from awardees, potential awardees, or parties to subagreements.
States and subrecipients may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited
item of nominal intrinsic value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods of procurement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each State and subrecipient shall use one of the following methods of procurement, as appropriate for each procurement
action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small purchase procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more
than $25,000 in the aggregate. Recipients and subrecipients shall not break down one purchase into several purchases
merely to be able to use small purchase procedures. The Governor shall establish standards for small purchase procedures
to ensure that price or rate quotations will be documented from an adequate number of qualified sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sealed bids (formal advertising)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_bids are publicly solicited procurements for which a firm-fixed-price award (lump sum or unit price) or other fixed-price
arrangement is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions
of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The Governor shall establish standards for sealed bids which include
requirements that invitations for bids be publicly advertised, and that bids be solicited from an adequate number
of organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Competitive proposals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement
type award is made. The Governor shall establish standards for competitive proposals which include requirements
for the establishment of a documented methodology for technical evaluations and award to the responsible offeror
whose proposals are most advantageous to the program with price, technical, and other factors considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncompetitive proposals (sole source)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, the funding of an unsolicited proposal, or
when, after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. Each State and subrecipient
shall minimize the use of sole source procurements to the extent practicable, but in every case the use of sole source
procurements shall be justified and documented. On-the-job training (OJT) awards (except OJT brokering awards,
which shall be selected competitively) and the enrollment of individual participants in classroom training may
be sole sourced. For all other awards, procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award is infeasible
under small purchase procedures, sealed bids, or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The item or service is available only from a single source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The public exigency or emergency need for the item or service does not permit a delay resulting from competitive
solicitation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) For SDAs, SSGs and subrecipients, the awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; for States, the
noncompetitive proposal is approved through the State's normal sole source approval process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass Throughs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The procurement rules do not apply to pass throughs of monies from any unit of State or local government (or SDA or SSG
administrative entities) to other such units, such as a local educational agency or public housing authority. To
qualify as a pass through, the receiving entity must either further pass through the monies to another such entity
or procure services in accordance with the procurement rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost or price analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each recipient, in accordance with the minimum requirements established in this section, shall establish standards
on the performance of cost or price analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each recipient and subrecipient shall perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action,
including modifications (except for modifications where a determination has been made that they do not have a monetary
impact). The method and degree of analysis depends on the facts surrounding the particular procurement and pricing
situation. At a minimum, the awarding agency shall make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.
A cost analysis is necessary when the offeror is required to submit the elements of the estimated cost (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as in the case of subrecipient relationships), when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements,
including modifications or change orders. A price analysis shall be used when price reasonableness can be established
on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public
or based on prices set by law or regulation (including situations involving inadequate price competition and sole
source procurements where a price analysis may be used in lieu of a cost analysis). When a cost analysis is necessary
and there is inadequate price competition, the offeror shall certify that to the best of its knowledge and belief,
the cost data are accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price. Awards or modifications negotiated
in reliance on such data should provide the awarding agency a right to a price adjustment to exclude any significant
sum by which the price was increased because the awardee had knowingly submitted data that were not accurate, complete,
or current as certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) JTPA procurements shall not permit excess program income (for nonprofit and governmental entities) or excess
profit (for private for-profit entities). If profit or program income is included in the price, the awarding agency
shall negotiate profit or program income as a separate element of the price for each procurement in which there is no
price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit or program
income, consideration shall be given to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The complexity of the work to be performed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The risk borne by the awardee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The offeror's investment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The amount of subcontracting/subgranting; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The quality of the offeror's record of past performance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Market conditions in the surrounding geographical area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Each recipient and subrecipient may charge to the agreement only those costs which are consistent with the allowable
cost provisions of &sect;627.435 of this part, including the guidelines issued by the Governor, as required at &sect;627.435(i)
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The cost plus a percentage of cost method shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oversight
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each recipient and subrecipient shall conduct and document oversight to ensure compliance with the procurement
standards, in accordance with the requirements of &sect;627.475 of this part, Oversight and monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each recipient and subrecipient shall maintain an administration system which ensures that vendors and subrecipients
perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transactions between units of government
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, procurement transactions between units of State or local
governments, or any other entities organized principally as the administrative entity for service delivery areas
or substate areas, shall be conducted on a cost reimbursable basis. Cost plus type awards are not allowable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of procurement transactions with schools that are a part of these entities, such as State universities
and secondary schools, when tuition charges or entrance fees are not more than the educational institution's catalogue
price, necessary to receive specific training, charged to the general public to receive the same training, and for
training of participants, the tuition and/ or entrance fee does not have to be broken out by items of cost.

(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disputes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The Governor shall ensure that the recipient and each subrecipient have protest procedures to handle and resolve
disputes relating to their procurements. A protester shall exhaust all administrative remedies with the subrecipient
before pursuing a protest at a higher level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Violations of law will be handled in accordance with the requirements contained in &sect;627.500(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Each recipient and subrecipient shall maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement.

of this part, Procurement, and section 164(a)(3) of the Act. The standards shall require that determinations of demonstrated
performance will be in writing, and completed prior to the award of an agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each recipient and subrecipient, to the extent practicable, shall select service providers on a competitive
basis, in accordance with the standards established in &sect;627.420(b) of this part, Procurement. When a State,
SDA, SSG, or administrative entity determines that services other than intake and eligibility determination will

Basic standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, each recipient and subrecipient shall be paid in advance,

Working capital advance payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a subrecipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (b) of this section, and the
awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the subrecipient lacks sufficient working
capital, the awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance payment basis. Under this procedure, the
awarding agency shall advance cash to the subrecipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period,
generally geared to the subrecipient's disbursing cycle. In no event may such an advance exceed 20 percent of the award
amount. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the subrecipient for its actual cash disbursements. The
working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by recipients or subrecipients if the reason for using
such method is the unwillingness or inability of the recipient or subrecipient to provide timely advances to the subrecipient
to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) A waiver of the recipient's liability can only be considered by the Grant Officer when the misexpenditure of JTPA
funds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Occurred at a subrecipient level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Was not a violation of section 164(e)(1) of the Act, or did not constitute fraud; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If fraud did exist, it was perpetrated against the recipient/subrecipient; and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The recipient/subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and prosecuted the perpetrator of said fraud;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After aggressive debt collection action, it can be documented that there is no likelihood of collection from
the perpetrator of the fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The recipient has issued a final determination which disallows the misexpenditure, the recipient's appeal process
has been exhausted, and a debt has been established; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The recipient requests such a waiver and provides documentation to demonstrate that it has substantially complied
with the requirements of section 164(e)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (D) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The recipient shall not be released from liability for misspent funds under the determination required by section
164(e) of the Act unless the Grant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the recipient or subrecipient,
would be inappropriate or would prove futile.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The recipient may request advance approval from the Grant Officer for contemplated corrective actions, including
debt collection actions, which the recipient plans to initiate or to forego. The recipient's request shall include
a description and an assessment of all actions taken by the subrecipient to collect the misspent funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may determine that the recipient may forego certain collection
actions against a subrecipient where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The subrecipient was not at fault with respect to the liability criteria set forth in section 164(e)(2)(A), (B),
(C), and (D) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The misexpenditure of funds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that received JTPA funds from that subrecipient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Was not a violation of section 164(e)(1) of the Act, or did not constitute fraud; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If fraud did exist, it was perpetrated against the subrecipient, and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and prosecuted the perpetrator of said fraud; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) After aggressive debt collection action, it can be documented that there is no likelihood of collection from the
perpetrator of the fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A final determination which disallows the misexpenditure and establishes a debt has been issued at the appropriate
level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Final action within the recipient's appeal system has been completed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Further debt collection action by that subrecipient or the recipient would be either inappropriate or futile.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A recipient may request that a debt, or a portion thereof, be offset against amounts allotted to the recipient,
and retained at the recipient level for administrative costs, under the current or a future JTPA entitlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For title II grants, any offset shall be applied against the recipient level 5 percent administrative cost set-aside
only and may not be distributed by the recipient among its subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For title III grants, any such offset must be applied against that portion of funds reserved by the recipient for
recipient level administration only and may not be distributed by the recipient among its subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Grant Officer may approve an offset request, under section 164(d) of the Act, if the misexpenditures were not
in violation of section 164(e)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If offset is granted, the debt shall not be fully satisfied until the Grant Officer reduces amounts allotted to
the State by the amount of the misexpenditure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The recipient shall not have the authority to reduce allocations to an SDA or SSG for misexpenditure of JTPA funds

Cost categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Cost categories applicable to PY 1992 and earlier funds will be subject to prior regulations either until the funds
have been exhausted or program activity has been completed. In order to assist the orderly transition to and implementation
of the new requirements of the 1992 JTPA amendments, an increase is allowed in the administrative cost limitation
for PY 1992 funds from 15 percent to 20 percent, with a corresponding adjustment to cost limitations for training and
participant support. Specifically, not less than 80 percent of the title II&hyph;A funds shall be expended for training
and participant support, and not less than 65 percent shall be expended for training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any prior year's carryover funds made available for use in PY 1993 will be subject to the reporting requirements
and cost categories applicable to PY 1993 funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining compliance with the JTPA cost limitations for PY 1992, Governors may either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine cost limitation compliance separately for funds expended in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and
(g)(2) of this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determine compliance for each cost category against the total PY 1992 funds, whether expended in accordance
with the Act and regulations in effect prior to the 1992 amendments to JTPA or in accordance with the amended Act and
these regulations. Using this option, the total combined funds expended for training and direct training should
be at least 65 percent of PY 1992 SDA allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In addition to the institutions specified in &sect;627.440(d)(1)(vi)(B), the costs of tuition and entrance
fees of a postsecondary vocational institution specified at section 481(c) of the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C.
1088(c)) may be charged to direct training services through June 30, 1995, when such tuition charges or entrance fees
are not more than the educational institution's catalog price, are necessary to receive specific training, are charged
to the general public to receive such training, and are for the training of participants.

Program implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The implementation by the States and SDA's of certain new program design requirements, particularly objective assessment
and development of individual service strategies (ISS), may require additional time to fully implement beyond July
1, 1993. Reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of &sect;&sect;628.515, 628.520, and 628.530. as soon as
possible after July 1, 1993, are expected to be made. However, it is not expected that every new participant will initially
receive objective assessment, ISS, and referral to non-title II services for a period of 6 months, or until January
1, 1994.

 The 50-percent out-of-school participants requirement for title II&hyph;C will be phased in during PY 1993 and will
not be the subject of compliance review until PY 1994, beginning July 1, 1994. During PY 1993, however, SDA's must show
significant improvement in the proportion of out-of-school youth being served and performance in increasing the
service ratio will be monitored by the States and DOL during this implementation period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the designation cannot be made for an off-year in this cycle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Each request for designation as an SDA shall be submitted in a form and by a date established by the Governor. The
procedures established by the Governor shall provide for the treatment of existing SDA's for the purposes of submitting
SDA designation requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The Governor shall approve SDA designation requests from entities with a population of 200,000 or more that

to satisfy the criteria specified in section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act. The Governor shall offer to designate the remaining
reduced area as an SDA as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When there are competing applications under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the same geographic area and
the designation of the entity with the population closest to 200,000 would have the effect of reducing the population
of the competing entity to below a population of 200,000, the Governor has the discretion to determine which request
to honor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Governor may, in accordance with section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act, approve a request to be a SDA from any unit,
or contiguous units, of general local government, without regard to population, which serves a substantial portion

delivery area meets criteria established by the Governor which, at a minimum, shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The capability to effectively deliver job training services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The capacity to administer the job training program in accordance with the Act, applicable rules and regulations
and State standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The portion of a labor market to be served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4)(A) and (B) of the Act, the term ``substantial part''
and ``substantial portion'' of a labor market area shall be defined by the Governor, but shall not be less than 10% of
the population of a labor market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) All areas within the State shall be covered by designated SDA's. After honoring all requests for designation from
eligible entities under section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act, and making any qualified discretionary designations under
section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act, the Governor shall include uncovered areas in the State within other designated
SDA's willing to accept them or within a State administered SDA.

This part implements Title III of the Act. Title III programs seek to establish an early readjustment capacity for
workers and firms in each State; to provide comprehensive coverage to workers regardless of the cause of dislocation;
to provide early referral from the unemployment insurance system to adjustment services as an integral part of the
adjustment process; to foster labor, management and community partnerships with government in addressing worker
dislocation; to emphasize retraining and reemployment services rather than income support; to create an on-going
substate capacity to deliver adjustment services; to tailor services to meet the needs of individuals; to improve
accountability by establishing a system of mandated performance standards; to improve financial management by
monitoring expenditures and reallotting available funds; and to provide the flexibility to target funds to the most
critical dislocation problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (8) Immediately notify (within 48 hours) the appropriate substate grantees following receipt of an employer notice
of layoff or plant closing or of any other information that indicates a projected layoff or plant closing by an employer
in the grantee's substate area, in order to continue and expand the services initiated by the rapid response team (section
311(b)(3)(D)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (9) Fully consult with labor organizations where substantial numbers of their members are to be served; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (10) Disseminate throughout the State information on the availability of services and activities under Title III
of the Act and this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rapid response capability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The dislocated worker unit shall have one or more rapid response specialists, and the capability to provide rapid
response assistance, on-site, for dislocation events such as permanent closures and substantial layoffs throughout
the State. The State shall not transfer the responsibility for the rapid response assistance functions of the State
dislocated worker unit to another entity, but the State may contract with another entity to perform rapid response
assistance services. Nothing in this paragraph shall remove or diminish the dislocated worker unit's accountability
for ensuring the effective delivery of rapid response assistance services throughout the State (section 311(b)(12)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) State rapid response specialists should be knowledgeable about the resources available through programs under
this part and all other appropriate resources available through public and private sources to assist dislocated
workers. The expertise required by this part includes knowledge of the Federal, State, and local training and employment
systems; labor-management relations and collective bargaining activities; private industry and labor market
trends; programs and services available to veterans; and other fields necessary to carry out the rapid response requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The rapid response specialists should have: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ability to organize a broad-based response to a dislocation event, including the ability to coordinate services
provided under this part with other State-administered programs available to assist dislocated workers, and the
ability to involve the substate grantee and local service providers in the assistance effort; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The authority to provide limited amounts of immediate financial assistance for rapid response activities,
including, where appropriate, financial assistance to labor-management committees formed under paragraph (c)(2)
of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Credibility among employers and in the employer community in order to effectively work with employers in difficult
situations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Credibility among employee groups and in the labor community, including organized labor, in order to effectively
work with employees in difficult situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) The dissemination of information on the State dislocated worker unit's services and activities should include
efforts to ensure that major employers, organized labor, and groups of employees not represented by organized labor,
are aware of the availability of rapid response assistance. The State dislocated worker unit should make equal effort
in responding to dislocation events without regard to whether the affected workers are represented by a union.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) In a situation involving an impending permanent closure or substantial layoff, a State may provide funds, where
other public or private resources are not expeditiously available, for a preliminary assessment of the advisability
of conducting a comprehensive study exploring the feasibility of having a company or group, including the workers,
purchase the plant and continue it in operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (5) Rapid response specialists may use funds available under this part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

48 hours or less) after becoming aware of a current or projected permanent closure or substantial layoff in order to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Provide information on and facilitate access to available public programs and services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) Provide emergency assistance adapted to the particular permanent closure or substantial layoff; such emergency
assistance may include financial assistance for appropriate rapid response activities, such as arranging for the
provision of early intervention services and other appropriate forms of immediate assistance in response to the
dislocation event;

 (iv) To collect information related to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) Economic dislocation (including potential closings or layoffs); and (B) All available resources within the
State for serving displaced workers, which information shall be made available on a regular basis to the Governor
and the State Council to assist in providing an adequate information base for effective program management, review,
and evaluation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) To provide or obtain appropriate financial and technical advice and liaison with economic development agencies
and other organizations to assist in efforts to avert worker dislocations;

 (vi) To disseminate information throughout the State on the availability of services and activities carried out
by the dislocated worker unit or office; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vii) To assist the local community in developing its own coordinated response and in obtaining access to State economic
development assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) Notwithstanding the definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response assistance)'' at &sect;631.2 of
this part;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) The Governor shall provide rapid response and basic readjustment services to members of a group of workers under
the NAFTA Worker Security Act for which the Governor has made a finding under &sect;631.3(j); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The Governor may, under exceptional circumstances, authorize rapid response assistance provided by a State
dislocated worker unit when the layoff is less than 50 or more individuals, is not at a single site of employment, or
does not take place during a single 30 day period. For purposes of this provision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exceptional circumstances
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include those situations which would have a major impact upon the community(ies) in which they occur (section 314(b)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labor-management committees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As provided in sections 301(b)(1) and 314(b)(1)(B) of the Act, labor-management committees are a form of rapid response
assistance which may be voluntarily established to respond to actual or prospective worker dislocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Labor management committees ordinarily include (but are not limited to) the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Shared and equal participation by workers and management, with members often selected in an informal fashion;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Shared financial participation between the company and the State, using funds provided under Title III of the
Act, in paying for the operating expenses of the committee; in some instances, labor union funds may help to pay committee
expenses;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Shall provide advice and leadership to the committee and prepare a report on its activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The ability to respond flexibly to the needs of affected workers by devising and implementing a strategy for assessing

(v) A formal agreement, terminable at will by the workers or the company management, and terminable for cause by the
Governor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Local job identification activities by the chairperson and members of the committee on behalf of the affected
workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Because they include employee representatives, labor-management committees typically provide a channel whereby
the needs of eligible dislocated workers can be assessed, and programs of assistance developed and implemented,
in an atmosphere supportive to each affected worker. As such, committees must be perceived to be representative and
fair in order to be most effective.

determining the incidence of need for worker dislocation assistance within the State. The formula may be amended
no more frequently than once each program year (section 302(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Governor may reserve an amount equal to not more than 40 percent of the funds allotted to the State under &sect;631.11

allocated to substate grantees and shall not be used for statewide activities. Such funds shall be included in each
substate grantee's allocation for purposes of cost limitations, as described in &sect;631.14 of this part (sections

requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section only upon a determination that the request is not consistent with
the effective delivery of services to eligible dislocated workers in the relevant labor market area, or would otherwise
not be appropriate to carry out the purposes of title III. The Governor will give good faith consideration to all such
requests by a consortium of SDAs to be a substate area. In denying a consortium's request for substate area designation,
the Governor shall set forth the basis and rationale for the denial (section 312(a)(5)).

area designation to the Secretary of Labor. The procedures that apply to such appeals shall be those set forth at &sect;628.405(g)
for appeals of the Governor's denial of SDA designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An entity described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that has been denied substate area designation may utilize
the State-level grievance procedures required by section 144(a) of the Act and subpart E of part 627 of this chapter

such agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

employment affording a reasonable expectation of long-term duration in the area in which the worker wishes to relocate,
or has obtained a bona fide offer of such employment, provided that the worker is totally separated from employment
at the time relocation commences. The cost of relocation for an eligible dislocated worker shall not exceed an amount
which is equal to the sum of the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in transporting the dislocated worker
and the dislocated worker's family, if any, and household effects, and a lump sum relocation allowance, equivalent
to three times such worker's average weekly wage. The maximum relocation allowance, however, shall not exceed $800,
unless a greater amount is justified in the grant application and approved by the Grant Officer. Necessary expenses
shall be travel expenses for the dislocated worker and the dislocated worker's family and for the transfer of household
effects. Reasonable costs for such travel and transfer expenses shall be by the least expensive, most reasonable
form of transportation.
